<ul class="tips-list">
    <li>
        <strong>Be descriptive.</strong> "I search the desk" is fine, but "I carefully check the desk drawers for hidden compartments or false bottoms" gives the AI more to work with.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Wait for the prompt before rolling.</strong> Don't pre-roll dice &mdash; the DM and AI decide what rolls are needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>One action at a time.</strong> Send one action per message. If you want to do multiple things, send multiple messages.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>NAT 20 / NAT 1</strong> are called out automatically when you roll through Foundry.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don't worry about rules.</strong> The AI Rules Lawyer handles D&amp;D 5e mechanics. Just describe what you want to do in plain English.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The &#9203; hourglass</strong> means your action was received. Sit tight &mdash; the DM will process it.
    </li>
</ul>
