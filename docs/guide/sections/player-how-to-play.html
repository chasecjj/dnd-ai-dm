    <p>How to take actions and interact with the AI Dungeon Master</p>
</div>
<div class="section-divider"></div>

<p>Playing is simple: <strong>type what your character does</strong> in natural language in the Game Table Discord channel. The AI Dungeon Master reads your action, applies the rules, and narrates the outcome. No memorizing commands — just describe your intent.</p>

<h3>Example Actions</h3>
<div class="code-block">I search the room for hidden doors</div>
<div class="code-block">I approach the merchant and ask about the rumors</div>
<div class="code-block">I cast Fireball at the group of goblins</div>
<div class="code-block">I try to persuade the guard to let us through</div>

<h3>How Your Action Is Processed</h3>
<p>When you send a message, you'll see an <strong>⏳ hourglass reaction</strong> appear on it. This means your action was received and is waiting in the queue.</p>

<p><strong>Queue Mode:</strong> Actions from all players queue up together. The DM reviews the batch, determines what rolls are needed, and the AI narrates the results for everyone before moving on. This keeps the game flowing smoothly even with multiple players.</p>

    <strong>One action per message.</strong> If you want to do multiple things, send multiple messages. Each message is one discrete action your character takes.
