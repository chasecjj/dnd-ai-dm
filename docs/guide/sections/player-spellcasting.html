<h3>Spell Slots</h3>
<p>Spell slots are your magical fuel. You spend a slot to cast a spell of that level or lower. Higher-level slots can power lower-level spells, sometimes with extra effect. All spent slots recharge after a long rest.</p>

<h3>Cantrips</h3>
<p>Free spells you can cast endlessly. No slot required. They're your magical basics — like a fighter's sword swing, but with arcane energy. Every spellcaster knows a handful, and they scale in power as you level up.</p>

<h3>Concentration</h3>
<p>Some spells require <strong>concentration</strong> to maintain their effect. The rules are straightforward:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can only maintain <strong>one</strong> concentration spell at a time.</li>
    <li>Casting another concentration spell ends the first.</li>
    <li>Taking damage might break it — you must make a <strong>CON save</strong> (DC = 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher).</li>
    <li>Being incapacitated or killed ends concentration automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
<p>Some spells have a <strong>ritual</strong> tag. You can cast them without spending a slot by adding 10 minutes to the casting time. This is perfect for out-of-combat utility spells like <em>Detect Magic</em>, <em>Identify</em>, or <em>Comprehend Languages</em>. Save your slots for when they matter.</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Don't worry about memorizing spell rules.</strong> Just describe what you want to do and the AI Rules Lawyer handles the mechanics. Say "I want to cast Shield" or "I try to detect any magic in the area" and the system takes care of the rest.
