<ul class="tips-list">
    <li>
        <strong>Analyze early.</strong> Click Analyze as soon as actions arrive. This gives players time to roll while you review.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Batch intelligently.</strong> Include related actions in the same resolve. The AI handles multi-character narration well.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use annotations freely.</strong> The AI reads your DM notes and adjusts its storytelling. "Make this dramatic" or "This should feel eerie" work great.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Monster rolls before Resolve.</strong> Roll monster attacks/damage before clicking Resolve so the AI has all the information for narration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Auto Mode for downtime.</strong> Switch to Auto Mode for tavern RP and exploration, then back to Queue Mode when combat starts.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The console thread persists.</strong> You can close and reopen it with <code>/console</code> without losing state.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>If the pipeline crashes.</strong> Actions are automatically restored to the queue. Check Moderator Log for errors, then try resolving again.
    </li>
</ul>
