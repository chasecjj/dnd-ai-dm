# The Yawning Portal

## Description
A legendary tavern in Castle Ward, Waterdeep. Famous for the massive entry well in its center — a 140-foot shaft that leads down into the dungeon of Undermountain. The tavern is large, busy, and filled with adventurers, regulars, and the curious. Heavy oak tables, chandeliers overhead, a long bar. Smells of spilled ale, wood smoke, and excitement.

## Current State
- **Post-Troll Attack:** The tavern is in disarray. Broken furniture, spilled drinks, dead Stirge remains on the floor. Patrons are emerging from under tables. A server was injured (unconscious but alive, being tended to by a regular).
- The Troll has been **shoved back into the well** by [[Frognar Emberheart]].
- [[Volothamp Geddarm]] has approached the party with a job offer.
- [[Krentz]] was trying to sneak toward the exit.

## Notable Features
- **The Well:** A 140-ft shaft to Undermountain in the center of the room. Stone lip. The Troll climbed out of here and was shoved back in.
- **Heavy Oak Tables:** Can be used as improvised weapons (Frognar proved this).
- **Chandeliers:** Could be used for environmental tactics.
- **The Bar:** Long bar area where a server was attacked by a Stirge.

## NPCs Present
- [[Durnan]] — Owner, bleeding from a claw swipe but standing strong.
- [[Yagra Strongfist]] — Cheering the party after the fight.
- [[Krentz]] — Trying to escape.
- [[Volothamp Geddarm]] — Approaching the party with a quest.

## Connections

## DM Notes
- The tavern environment should reward Investigation checks — flammable objects, heavy furniture, environmental hazards.
- Durnan is the key NPC here. He controls access to the well.
- After the fight, the City Watch may arrive — have the **Code Legal** handout ready.
