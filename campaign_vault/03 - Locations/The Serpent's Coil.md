## Description
The Serpent's Coil reeks of saltwater, stale ale, and unwashed bodies. Dim light flickers from oil lamps, casting long shadows across the rough-hewn tables and the damp, moss-covered stone walls. The air hangs heavy with the murmur of hushed conversations and the occasional drunken brawl.

## Key Features
['A perpetually damp floor covered in sawdust.', 'A scarred wooden bar with a thick layer of grime.', 'A back room rumored to be used for clandestine meetings.', 'A crude painting of a sea serpent hangs crookedly above the bar.']

## NPCs Present
["Barnaby 'Barnacle Bart' Grimsby (Human): The surly, one-eyed owner and barkeep.", 'Slinky Sylvie (Tiefling): A nimble-fingered pickpocket who frequents the tavern.', 'Captain Vorlag (Half-Orc): A gruff sea captain looking for a crew.']

## Secrets
['Barnacle Bart is secretly a low-level operative for the Zhentarim, using the tavern to pass messages and arrange deals.', "The back room contains a hidden passage leading to a smuggler's tunnel beneath the city.", 'Slinky Sylvie overheard a conversation about a lost treasure map and is looking for someone to help her find it.']

## Encounter Possibilities
['A bar fight erupts between two drunken sailors.', 'Zhentarim thugs attempt to shake down a patron for protection money.', 'A mysterious figure in a hooded cloak approaches the party, offering them a dangerous job.']
