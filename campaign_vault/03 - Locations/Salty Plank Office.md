## Description
The air is thick with the smell of brine, ink, and mildew. Stacks of ledgers teeter precariously on shelves, threatening to spill onto the already cluttered floor.

## Key Features
['Large desk overflowing with papers', 'Locked strongbox hidden beneath the desk', 'Dusty window overlooking the docks', 'A single, flickering oil lamp']

## NPCs Present
Potentially Krentz (if he's overseeing operations here), a nervous clerk, or a low-level Xanathar Guild thug.

## Secrets
['The ledgers contain coded references to illicit activities, possibly smuggling.', 'The strongbox contains a cache of coins and a compromising letter implicating a city official.', 'A hidden compartment in the desk reveals a map to a secret meeting location.']

## Encounter Possibilities
['A Xanathar Guild patrol arrives to check on the office.', 'A rival gang (possibly Zhentarim) attempts to raid the office.', "The nervous clerk panics and attacks the party, fearing exposure of the warehouse's activities."]
