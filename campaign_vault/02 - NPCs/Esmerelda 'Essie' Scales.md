## Description
Essie is a stout woman in her late forties, with a network of wrinkles around her eyes that crinkle when she smiles (or gossips). She always wears a stained apron and smells perpetually of fish, though not unpleasantly so.

## Personality
Essie is a font of local gossip, always eager to share what she knows (or thinks she knows). She speaks quickly and dramatically, often exaggerating details for effect. She has a soft spot for adventurers and will offer them discounts on her fish if they listen to her stories.

## Secret
Essie is secretly a former member of a thieves' guild (not the Zhentarim or Xanathar Guild), and she still maintains contacts within the criminal underworld. She uses her fishmongering business as a front to gather information and occasionally fences stolen goods.

## Connections
Essie knows Barnacle Blane well, as they both operate in the Briny Bazaar. She might also have heard rumors about activities at The Whispering Crates Warehouse or The Sunken Keg Warehouse, given their proximity to the docks.

## Plot Hooks
['Essie overheard a shady conversation between two men (possibly Xanathar Guild members) about a shipment arriving at the docks soon, and she asks the party to investigate.', "Essie's prized fishing net was stolen, and she suspects a local gang (perhaps connected to the Iron Ring) is responsible. She offers the party a reward if they recover it.", 'Essie hints that a valuable treasure was hidden somewhere in the Dock Ward long ago, and she knows a few clues that might lead the party to it.']
