## Description
Silas is a handsome man in his late 30s with impeccably styled dark hair and piercing blue eyes. He favors tailored suits of deep velvet and always wears a silver signet ring bearing a stylized serpent.

## Personality
Silas is smooth and charismatic, always ready with a charming smile and a flattering word. He enjoys the finer things in life and exudes an air of effortless sophistication, though he is quick to anger when challenged or disrespected.

## Secret
Silas is secretly embezzling funds from the Zhentarim, using his position to line his own pockets and build his own power base within Waterdeep. He's also searching for a lost artifact hidden somewhere in the city, believing it will grant him even greater influence.

## Connections
May offer counter-quests to Liss and Torvin, creating conflict for the party. Might be interested in Volo's quest if it leads to valuable information or treasure. His Zhentarim connection could tie back to Yagra at the Yawning Portal.

## Plot Hooks
["Silas hires the party for a seemingly simple task – to retrieve a 'misplaced' ledger from a rival noble. The ledger actually contains evidence of Silas's embezzlement.", 'Silas asks the party to investigate a series of thefts from wealthy merchants, subtly guiding them toward a Zhentarim operation (orchestrated by Liss or Torvin) to eliminate his competition.', "The party overhears Silas having a hushed conversation about the 'serpent's eye' and a hidden vault. Following him could lead to a dangerous treasure hunt or uncover his Zhentarim secrets."]
