## Description
Blane is a powerfully built man, despite a slight stoop. He's missing his left eye, replaced by a milky white scar that pulls at the corner of his mouth, giving him a perpetual sneer.

## Personality
Blane is pragmatic and blunt, with little patience for pleasantries. He speaks in a low growl, often spitting when he talks. He's always looking for an angle, but values discretion.

## Secret
Blane used to be a member of the Zhentarim, but was betrayed and left for dead. He now holds a deep grudge against them, especially Liss Umbero, whom he suspects was involved in his downfall.

## Connections
Blane's knowledge of the docks and connections to both the Zhentarim and Xanathar Guild could make him a valuable, if dangerous, source of information. His past connection to the Zhentarim puts him at odds with Liss and potentially Torvin.

## Plot Hooks
["Blane needs someone to 'relocate' some goods before the City Watch finds them, offering a cut of the profits.", 'Blane knows something about a recent Zhentarim operation gone wrong and is willing to share information in exchange for a favor (potentially involving Liss Umbero).', 'Blane is looking for information on who betrayed him years ago, and believes the party might be able to help him uncover the truth.']
