## Description
Elara is a thin woman with darting eyes and perpetually ink-stained fingers. She wears layers of dark, nondescript clothing and often pulls her scarf up to hide the lower half of her face.

## Personality
Elara is easily startled and speaks in hushed tones, constantly looking over her shoulder. She's driven by self-preservation and willing to trade information or services for coin or safe passage, but trusts no one.

## Secret
Elara is on the run from the [[Xanathar Guild]] after accidentally intercepting a message intended for them. She fears retribution and is desperate to disappear.

## Connections
She might know about [[Grimbold 'Grim' Tanner]]'s dealings at the [[The Sunken Keg Warehouse]], and could have information about stolen goods being moved through [[Dead Man's Pinch]]. Could also be a source of information on [[Krentz]] at the [[Yawning Portal]].

## Plot Hooks
["Elara needs help escaping Waterdeep and will offer valuable information about the [[Zhentarim]]'s operations in the Dock Ward in exchange for safe passage.", 'She possesses a coded message she believes is important to the [[Xanathar Guild]], and the party could choose to deliver it (for a reward) or decipher it themselves.', 'Elara can provide information about a specific item or person if the party completes a dangerous task for her, such as retrieving a stolen ledger from a [[Zhentarim]] safehouse.']
