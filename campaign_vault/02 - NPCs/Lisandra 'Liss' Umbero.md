## Description
Liss is a slender woman in her late twenties, with sharp features and close-cropped dark hair. She wears well-maintained studded leather armor, and a shortsword hangs at her hip, though she seems more comfortable with ledgers than combat.

## Personality
Efficient and pragmatic, Liss is all business. She speaks in clipped tones and values competence above all else. She has a keen eye for detail and a remarkable memory, especially when it comes to numbers and inventory.

## Secret
Liss is secretly skimming a small percentage of the warehouse's profits to fund her own escape from the Zhentarim's influence. She dreams of opening a small accounting firm in a quieter part of Waterdeep.

## Connections
She is acquainted with Torvin 'Knuckles' Stonefist through their shared, albeit unofficial, affiliation with the Zhentarim. She might also have information about illicit goods moving through the Dock Ward that could tie into the Xanathar Guild.

## Plot Hooks
['Liss notices discrepancies in the inventory and suspects someone is stealing from the warehouse. She might hire the party to investigate, offering a cut of the recovered goods as payment.', 'Liss needs someone discreet to deliver a sensitive package to a contact outside of Waterdeep. She is willing to pay handsomely for reliable couriers.', "If the party uncovers her skimming, Liss might attempt to bribe them to keep quiet, or even blackmail them with compromising information she's gathered."]
