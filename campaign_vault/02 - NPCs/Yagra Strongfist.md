# Yagra Strongfist

## Description
A tough, muscular half-orc woman. Carries a massive mace. Confident and aggressive in combat.

## Background
An agent of the [[Zhentarim]]. Was involved in a fistfight with [[Krentz]] (Xanathar Guild) when the Troll emerged.

## Party Relationship
- The party **watched** the Yagra vs. Krentz brawl rather than intervening — chose patience over impulse.
- During the Troll fight, Yagra flanked the Troll opposite [[Durnan]]: *"I'll keep the big one busy! You lot handle the pests and find some gods-damned fire!"*
- After the fight: Cheered the party, slammed her mace against her palm.
- Currently **friendly** to the party.

## Known Information
- Member of the [[Zhentarim]] (party may or may not know this yet).
- Capable fighter — held her own against both Krentz and the Troll.

## DM Notes
- Potential quest hook for Zhentarim storyline.
- If the party had helped her during the brawl, she'd be even more loyal. Current disposition: appreciative but not deeply bonded.
