# Session 1

## Summary
The adventurers, fresh off the boat in the war-torn harbor town of Widow's Walk, found themselves immediately embroiled in local troubles. They chose to investigate a series of disappearances plaguing the town, leading them to a confrontation with a trio of bloodthirsty goblins lurking in the abandoned docks. Victorious but wary, they discovered a crudely drawn map hinting at a hidden lair deeper within the Widow's Weep marshes, setting them on a path towards uncovering the source of the town's woes. Will you follow the goblin's map?
