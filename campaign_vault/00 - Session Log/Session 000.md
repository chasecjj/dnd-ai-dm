# Session 0

## Summary
Amidst the boisterous atmosphere of the Yawning Portal, an unsettling whisper drew the attention of the party, leading to a tense encounter with the tavern's watchful proprietor, Durnan. Chaos erupted as a monstrous troll emerged from the depths of the well, prompting a swift and decisive response from Victor Saltzpyre, who vanquished the beast. The victory was short-lived, however, as the party's eccentric behavior, including Sigfried's unsavory exploration of the environment and Kallisar's magical mishaps, alienated the tavern's patrons, culminating in a disturbing act of self-mutilation. The session concluded with Sigfried tunneling into the sewers beneath Waterdeep, while the ominous figure of Balthur, revealed as a main antagonist, retreated to a foreboding castle, leaving the party to ponder the mysteries that lie ahead.
