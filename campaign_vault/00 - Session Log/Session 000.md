## Summary
The Yawning Portal, a tavern built around a gaping chasm leading into the depths of Undermountain, welcomes a new face: Victor Saltzpyre. As he steps inside, an unsettling whisper emanates from the tavern's central well, a sound that goes unnoticed by most but not by the watchful proprietor, Durnan. Saltzpyre, drawn by an unseen force, attempts to decipher the source of the whispering, setting the stage for mysteries yet to be unraveled in the heart of Waterdeep. What will you do next?
