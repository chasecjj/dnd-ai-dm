# Survive the Troll Attack

## Objective
Protect the patrons of the [[Yawning Portal]] and survive the Troll + Stirge attack.

## Background
A Troll covered in blood-sucking Stirges clawed its way out of the Undermountain entrance well during a brawl between [[Yagra Strongfist]] and [[Krentz]].

## Progress
- [x] Fight the Stirges threatening patrons
- [x] Discover the Troll's fire weakness
- [x] Stop the Troll's regeneration with fire
- [x] Defeat the Troll

## Outcome
The party killed all 3 Stirges (2 by [[Kallisar Voidcaller]], 1 by [[Frognar Emberheart]]). Frognar coated his longsword in oil and used Searing Smite to stop the Troll's regeneration, then shoved it back into the well. [[Durnan]] and [[Yagra Strongfist]] assisted.

## Rewards
- [[Durnan]]'s respect: *"Not bad for a couple of newcomers."*
- [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s attention and a job offer.
- An injured server was saved.
