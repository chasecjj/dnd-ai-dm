# Volo's Quest

## Objective
_Not yet revealed — Volo has not yet approached the party._

## Background
[[Volothamp Geddarm]] has a matter of some urgency. He is looking for capable adventurers to help him.

## Progress
- [ ] Meet Volo at the Yawning Portal
- [ ] Accept or decline Volo's offer
- [ ] Learn the details of the quest

## DM Notes
- This is the **Dragon Heist main quest hook.**
- Volo will ask the party to find his friend **Floon Blagmaar**, who has gone missing.
- The search for Floon will lead the party into the conflict between the [[Zhentarim]] and the [[Xanathar Guild]].
- Volo's reward will ultimately be **Trollskull Manor** — a run-down tavern the party can renovate.
