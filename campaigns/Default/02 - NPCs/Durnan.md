# Durnan

## Description
Grizzled, battle-scarred retired adventurer. Owns and operates the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern. Wields a greatsword with practiced ease despite his age.

## Background
A legendary former adventurer who explored the depths of Undermountain. Now runs the tavern that sits atop its entrance — the famous well in the center of the common room.

## Party Relationship
Not yet met.

## Known Information
- Knows about the entrance to Undermountain (the well).

- Key NPC for Dragon Heist. Bridge between the tavern and the dungeon below.
