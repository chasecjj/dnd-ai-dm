# Durnan

## Description
Grizzled, battle-scarred retired adventurer. Owns and operates the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern. Wields a greatsword with practiced ease despite his age.

## Background
A legendary former adventurer who explored the depths of Undermountain. Now runs the tavern that sits atop its entrance — the famous well in the center of the common room.

## Party Relationship
- Fought alongside the party during the [[Troll Attack]]. Took the Troll's aggro to protect the party (as intended by the Dragon Heist module for Level 1 characters).
- After the fight: *"Not bad for a couple of newcomers. You've got iron in your blood."*
- Grateful to the party for their help defending the tavern.

## Known Information
- Knows about the entrance to Undermountain (the well).
- Has NOT revealed his past as an adventurer to the party.
- Shouted combat commands during the fight: *"The girl! Get the bug off the girl and find me some fire, or this beast'll never die!"* and *"Do it now, lad! Burn the damn thing!"*

## DM Notes
- Key NPC for Dragon Heist. Bridge between the tavern and the dungeon below.
- Was bleeding from a claw swipe during the Troll fight — took real damage defending the party.
- Will likely offer the party a discount or favors as a consequence of their bravery.
