## Description
Razor is a hulking tiefling with crimson skin and wickedly curved horns filed to sharp points. Jagged scars crisscross his face and arms, souvenirs from brutal pit fights.

## Personality
Razor is cruel, calculating, and utterly devoid of empathy. He enjoys inflicting pain and revels in the fear he inspires. He speaks with a low growl, often punctuated by a disturbing chuckle.

## Secret
Razor is secretly funneling a portion of his earnings to his younger sister, a human girl living in the Trades Ward, hoping to buy her a better life far away from the Dock Ward's squalor.

## Connections
His activities may overlap with the Zhentarim or Xanathar Guild, who may be indirectly involved in the slave trade. He might know Elara Crimp or Barnacle Blane, as they operate in similar areas.

## Plot Hooks
['The party witnesses Razor roughing up a merchant who failed to pay protection money, leading to a confrontation.', 'A young woman approaches the party, desperately seeking information about her missing brother, who Razor recently enslaved.', "The party discovers Razor's secret connection to his sister and must decide whether to exploit it for information or protect her from the dangers of his world."]
