# Krentz

## Description
A cowardly thug. Quick to start trouble but the first to hide when real danger appears.

## Background
An agent of the [[Xanathar Guild]]. Started a fistfight with [[Yagra Strongfist]] that sparked the tavern chaos.

## Party Relationship
- The party has not interacted with Krentz directly.
- He was cowering behind a pillar during the Troll fight, clutching a dagger with trembling hands.
- After the fight: **Tried to sneak toward the exit** while everyone was distracted.

## Known Information
- Quote: *"Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?"* — said to Yagra just before the fight.
- A coward who only fights when he has the advantage.

## DM Notes
- The party had the option to confront Krentz before he escaped — **this choice has not yet been resolved.**
- Could be a source of information about the [[Xanathar Guild]] if captured/interrogated.
- His escape (if it happened) could lead to complications later — he saw the party fight.
