## Description
Grimbold is a burly man with a shaved head and a network of scars crisscrossing his arms. He wears patched leather armor and constantly chews on a piece of driftwood.

## Personality
Grim is gruff, suspicious, and quick to anger. He demands respect and sees any question as a challenge to his authority. He speaks in short, clipped sentences and spits frequently.

## Secret
Grimbold is secretly in debt to the Xanathar Guild, owing them a substantial sum after a gambling spree gone wrong. He's desperate to keep this a secret.

## Connections
His 'neutrality' makes him a potential point of contact or conflict for both the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild. The Sunken Keg Warehouse is near the Whispering Crates, so there could be past conflicts with Zhentarim guards.

## Plot Hooks
['The party might need access to the Sunken Keg Warehouse and must negotiate (or fight) their way past Grim.', "The Zhentarim, knowing of Grim's reputation for taking coin, might approach the party to 'persuade' Grim to look the other way during a clandestine operation.", "The Xanathar Guild might contact the party to collect Grim's debt, offering a cut of the 'take' if they succeed."]
