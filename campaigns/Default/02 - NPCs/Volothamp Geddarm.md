# Volothamp Geddarm (Volo)

## Description
A man with flamboyant robes and a very well-groomed beard. Overly enthusiastic, dramatic, and self-important. Was frantically taking notes during the entire Troll fight.

## Background
Famous author of *Volo's Guide to Monsters* and other works. A well-known (and somewhat unreliable) adventurer and storyteller in Waterdeep.

## Party Relationship
- Approached the party immediately after the [[Troll Attack]].
- *"Astounding! Simply marvelous! The bravery! The technique! The... table-tossing! I am Volothamp Geddarm, and I believe the gods have sent you to me. I have a matter of some urgency, and you two look like just the sorts to handle it. May I buy you a round? (Non-alcoholic for the Paladin, perhaps?)"*
- Has offered the party a drink and a job. **The party has NOT yet accepted or declined.**

## Known Information
- Famous author — his name carries weight in Waterdeep.
- Has a "matter of some urgency" — the Dragon Heist main quest hook.
- Was watching and taking notes during the fight — interested in spectacle.

## DM Notes
- **This is the Dragon Heist main quest trigger.** Volo will ask the party to find his friend Floon Blagmaar, who has gone missing.
- Volo is flamboyant but not wealthy — his rewards tend to be... creative rather than monetary.
- The party's response to his offer is the next major decision point in the campaign.
