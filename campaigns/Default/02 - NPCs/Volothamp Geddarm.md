# Volothamp Geddarm (Volo)

## Description
A man with flamboyant robes and a very well-groomed beard. Overly enthusiastic, dramatic, and self-important.

## Background
Famous author of *Volo's Guide to Monsters* and other works. A well-known (and somewhat unreliable) adventurer and storyteller in Waterdeep.

## Party Relationship
Not yet met.

## Known Information
- Famous author — his name carries weight in Waterdeep.
- Has a "matter of some urgency" — the Dragon Heist main quest hook.

## DM Notes
- **This is the Dragon Heist main quest trigger.** Volo will ask the party to find his friend Floon Blagmaar, who has gone missing.
- Volo is flamboyant but not wealthy — his rewards tend to be... creative rather than monetary.
