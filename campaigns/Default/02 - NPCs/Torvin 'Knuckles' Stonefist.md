## Description
Torvin is a broad-shouldered man with a thick, scarred neck and a perpetually suspicious squint. He wears well-worn leather armor and carries a heavy club, its end stained a disturbing dark color.

## Personality
Torvin is taciturn and suspicious of strangers, but fiercely loyal to those he trusts. He grunts more than he speaks and has a habit of cracking his knuckles when nervous or considering a question.

## Secret
Torvin is secretly feeding information to a rival Zhentarim faction, hoping to undermine the current leadership and install someone he believes is more competent.

## Connections
His 'unofficial' status with the Zhentarim could be leveraged by Yagra Strongfist. He also has a history with The Gilded Lily, occasionally visiting for a drink and gossip.

## Plot Hooks
['Torvin could be bribed or persuaded to look the other way, allowing the party access to the warehouse.', 'The party might overhear Torvin muttering about his dissatisfaction with the Zhentarim leadership, leading to a potential alliance.', 'Investigating the Whispering Crates Warehouse, the party discovers a coded message meant for Torvin, revealing his treachery.']
