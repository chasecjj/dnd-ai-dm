# Zhentarim (The Black Network)

## Overview
A shadowy network of merchants, mercenaries, and criminals. They operate through legitimate fronts but enforce their interests through intimidation and violence. In Waterdeep, they are in a power struggle with the [[Xanathar Guild]].

## Known Members
- [[Yagra Strongfist]] — Agent. Currently friendly to the party.

## Party Standing
- **Disposition:** Neutral
- **Reputation:** 0
- The party observed the Yagra vs Krentz brawl without intervening. Neither earned favor nor enmity.

## Key Interests
- Control of Waterdeep's underground economy.
- In conflict with the [[Xanathar Guild]].

## DM Notes
- Frognar's gambling debt could be tied to the Zhentarim — creating an interesting conflict if the party also allies with them later.
- Yagra could become a recurring contact if the party seeks out the Zhentarim.
