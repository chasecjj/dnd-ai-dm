## Overview
A thieves' guild run by the beholder Xanathar from a hidden lair beneath Waterdeep. They control much of the city's criminal underworld and are in open conflict with the [[Zhentarim]].

## Known Members
- [[Krentz]] — Low-level thug. Started a brawl with [[Yagra Strongfist]]. Attempted to flee after the [[Troll Attack]].

## Party Standing
- **Disposition:** Unknown (the party hasn't directly interacted with the Guild)
- **Reputation:** 0


## Key Interests
- Total control of Waterdeep's criminal underworld.
- Eliminating the [[Zhentarim]] presence in the city.
- Xanathar (the beholder) is paranoid and obsessive.

## DM Notes
- The Xanathar Guild is a primary antagonist in Dragon Heist.
- Krentz's escape/capture will determine when the Guild becomes aware of the party.
- The Guild's awareness of the party is an important narrative thread.
