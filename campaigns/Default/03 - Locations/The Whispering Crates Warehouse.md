## Description
Dusty crates fill the main room, with narrow aisles and a musty smell that clings to the back of your throat. A rickety staircase groans underfoot as it leads to an upper level overlooking the maze below.

## Key Features
['Crates of varying sizes, some labeled with faded shipping manifests', 'A hidden trapdoor under a loose pile of crates leading to a lower level', 'A makeshift office on the upper level, with ledgers and maps strewn about', 'Scattered rat droppings and the occasional scurrying sound']

## NPCs Present
["Barnaby 'Barnacle Butt' Grimpole (Human) - a nervous, twitchy dockworker who acts as a lookout.", "Esmerelda 'Esme' Rosethorn (Half-elf) - a ruthless smuggler who uses the warehouse as a temporary storage point."]

## Secrets
['The warehouse is a front for a Zhentarim smuggling operation, dealing in illicit goods.', 'Esme is secretly working against the Zhentarim, feeding information to a rival faction.', 'The lower level contains a hidden cache of weapons and stolen artifacts.']

## Encounter Possibilities
['A group of Giant Rats (3-5) guarding a particularly large crate.', "Barnaby, startled by the party's presence, attempts to bribe them with a few silver pieces.", "Esme and two Zhentarim Thugs are arguing about a shipment that went missing. A fight breaks out, regardless of the party's presence."]
