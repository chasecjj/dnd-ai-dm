## Description
The Briny Bazaar assaults the senses with the briny tang of the sea, the pungent aroma of drying seaweed, and the cries of vendors hawking their catches. Gulls wheel overhead, hoping for scraps amidst a throng of sailors, merchants, and curious onlookers.

## Key Features
['Central fountain spouting seawater, often filled with small, discarded shells and the occasional coin.', 'Makeshift stalls constructed from salvaged ship timbers and colorful tarpaulins.', 'Live seafood tanks where customers can select their meal directly.', 'A raised platform where a rotating cast of bards and storytellers perform for tips.', 'A dedicated area for oyster shucking, with piles of shells growing steadily throughout the day.']

## NPCs Present
['Old Man Hemlock: A grizzled fishmonger with a missing finger, known for his tall tales of sea monsters.', 'Coralia: A young, energetic vendor selling exotic shells and pearls, rumored to have connections to smugglers.', "Barnaby 'Barnacle Butt' Grugg: A jovial dwarf who runs the oyster shucking station, always up for a wager.", 'Sister Garaele (undercover): A cleric of Valkur (god of sailors) disguised as a fortune teller, looking for signs of encroaching evil in the harbor.']

## Secrets
["A hidden compartment beneath Old Man Hemlock's stall contains a map to a sunken treasure ship.", 'Coralia uses her shell sales as a front for smuggling illicit goods for the Zhentarim, possibly working with Liss Umbero at the Salty Plank.', 'Barnaby is secretly in debt to the Xanathar Guild and uses the oyster shells to smuggle messages.']

## Encounter Possibilities
['A pickpocket attempts to relieve a PC of their purse amidst the crowded stalls.', 'A brawl breaks out between rival fishing crews over a disputed catch.', 'A swarm of seagulls descends upon the market, creating chaos as they try to steal fish.']
