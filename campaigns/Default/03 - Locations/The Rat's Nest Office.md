## Description
The air hangs thick with the smells of mildew, cheap ink, and rat droppings. Dusty ledgers and half-empty ink bottles litter a scarred wooden desk, the only source of light being a flickering oil lamp that casts long, dancing shadows across the cramped space.

## Key Features
['False wall entrance, triggered by a specific crate-stacking pattern', 'Desk covered in ledgers detailing illicit trades (mostly mundane goods, some hints of smuggling)', 'A locked strongbox hidden under a loose floorboard', 'A small cot in the corner, suggesting someone occasionally sleeps here']

## NPCs Present
["Torvin 'Knuckles' Stonefist (visits occasionally)", "A low-level Zhentarim thug (guarding the office, name could be 'Rook' or similar)"]

## Secrets
['The strongbox contains a coded message detailing a meeting location and time', 'One of the ledgers contains a discrepancy, hinting at embezzlement within the Zhentarim', 'A hidden compartment in the desk reveals a small collection of rare coins']

## Encounter Possibilities
['A patrol of Xanathar Guild members searching for stolen goods stumble upon the hidden entrance.', "A swarm of rats, agitated by the players' intrusion, attacks.", 'Torvin Stonefist arrives unexpectedly, catching the players snooping.']
