# The Yawning Portal

## Description
A legendary tavern in Castle Ward, Waterdeep. Famous for the massive entry well in its center — a 140-foot shaft that leads down into the dungeon of Undermountain. The tavern is large, busy, and filled with adventurers, regulars, and the curious. Heavy oak tables, chandeliers overhead, a long bar. Smells of spilled ale, wood smoke, and excitement.

## Current State
- A busy evening at the tavern. Patrons fill the tables, drinks are flowing, and the usual hum of adventurer gossip fills the room.
- [[Durnan]] is behind the bar, keeping a watchful eye on the crowd.
- The well sits in the center of the room, roped off with a simple barrier.

## Notable Features
- **The Well:** A 140-ft shaft to Undermountain in the center of the room. Stone lip, roped off.
- **Heavy Oak Tables:** Sturdy tavern furniture throughout the common room.
- **Chandeliers:** Could be used for environmental tactics.
- **The Bar:** Long bar area where servers move between patrons.
