## Description
The Sunken Keg Warehouse reeks of seawater and cheap ale. Piles of crates and barrels lean precariously, casting long shadows in the dim light filtering through grimy windows. The air hangs heavy with the scent of rotting wood and forgotten dreams.

## Key Features
['A rickety wooden loading dock extending over the harbor', 'A small, damp office cluttered with ledgers and empty bottles', 'A hidden trapdoor leading to a flooded sub-basement']

## NPCs Present
["Barkeep 'Barnacle Bart' (Human) - runs a small, illegal tavern within the warehouse", "Rizzo 'Fingers' (Halfling) - a nimble thief using the warehouse as a hideout", "Torvin 'Knuckles' Stonefist (Human) - Zhentarim, occasionally uses the warehouse for storage (from existing NPCs)"]

## Secrets
['The sub-basement contains a smuggled shipment of rare wines hidden beneath the waterline', 'Barnacle Bart is secretly informing on Zhentarim activities to a rival faction', 'One of the crates contains a caged creature (perhaps a monstrous crab or a small dragon)']

## Encounter Possibilities
['A group of drunken sailors looking for a brawl', 'Zhentarim thugs searching for a missing shipment', "A swarm of rats disturbed by the party's presence"]
