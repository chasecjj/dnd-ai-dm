## Description
Stink Alley is a narrow, trash-filled passage choked between the looming warehouses. A single, sputtering oil lamp casts long, distorted shadows, revealing piles of refuse and the slick sheen of questionable fluids on the cobblestones. The air hangs thick with the mingled scents of rotting fish, stale ale, and unwashed bodies.

## Key Features
['Overflowing refuse bins attracting rats and stray dogs', 'Graffiti markings—some gang-related, others just crude drawings', 'A persistent puddle of stagnant water that never seems to dry', 'The back doors of The Whispering Crates Warehouse and The Sunken Keg Warehouse are accessible from here']

## NPCs Present
['Urchin spies from the Xanathar Guild', 'Zhentarim thugs on patrol', "A homeless person named 'Whisper' who claims to know secrets about both warehouses"]

## Secrets
['A loose cobblestone hides a small cache of Zhentarim black market goods (e.g., potent poisons, counterfeit coins)', 'A hidden crawlspace behind a stack of crates leads into The Whispering Crates Warehouse', 'Whisper saw Elara Crimp meeting with someone in a hooded cloak near the alley last night']

## Encounter Possibilities
['A group of Xanathar Guild urchins attempts to pickpocket the party.', "Two Zhentarim thugs demand a 'toll' for passage through the alley.", 'A pack of rabid rats attacks, driven by hunger and disease.']
