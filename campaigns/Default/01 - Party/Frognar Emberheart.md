## Abilities & Features
- **Divine Sense:** Can detect celestials, fiends, and undead within 60 ft.
- **Lay on Hands:** Pool of 5 HP (currently spent — used to cure Poisoned condition during Troll fight).
- **Fighting Style:** Not yet specified.

## Prepared Spells
- **Searing Smite** (1st level) — Bonus Action, next weapon attack deals extra fire damage. *Used during Troll fight.*
- **Heroism** (1st level) — Action, target immune to Frightened + temp HP each turn.

## Inventory
- Chain Mail (AC 16)
- Shield
- Longsword
- _A few coins lighter from gambling_

## Personality
- **Self-righteous** but with a gambling addiction — a walking contradiction.
- Prone to impulsive, spectacular acts (flipped a table onto a Stirge, shoved a Troll into a well).
- Gets "ale-addled" — has been known to drink himself into the Poisoned condition.
- Comedic in crisis — mistook his own Lay on Hands glow for being on fire.

## Bonds & Hooks
- **Gambling Debt:** Owes money to the wrong people. Could be tied to the [[Cassalanters]] (tragic twist) or the [[Zhentarim]] (gang war conflict).
- Close friendship with [[Kallisar Voidcaller]] — they are an "Odd Couple" dynamic.

## Session Notes
- **Session 0:** Defended the [[Yawning Portal]] during the [[Troll Attack]]. Used Lay on Hands to sober up mid-combat. Coated his longsword in oil and used Searing Smite to stop the Troll's regeneration. Shoved the Troll back into the well with a clutch Athletics check (rolled 16 vs Troll's 12).
