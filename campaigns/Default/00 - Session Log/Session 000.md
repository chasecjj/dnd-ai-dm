# Session 0 — The Troll in the Well

## Summary
[[Frognar Emberheart]] and [[Kallisar Voidcaller]] were drinking at the [[Yawning Portal]] when a brawl erupted between [[Yagra Strongfist]] (Zhentarim) and [[Krentz]] (Xanathar Guild). The party chose to watch rather than intervene. The brawl was interrupted when a massive Troll covered in blood-sucking Stirges clawed its way out of the entry well. The party fought the Stirges and Troll alongside [[Durnan]] and Yagra, ultimately shoving the burning Troll back into the well. Afterward, [[Volothamp Geddarm]] approached with a job offer.

## Key Events

| Round 1 | Kallisar kills Stirge 1 (dual-wield aerial attack) | First kill of the campaign | 7 | |

| Round 1 | Frognar uses Lay on Hands to cure Poisoned condition | Comedic moment — thought his hands were on fire | 6 | |

## Combat Encounters
### The Troll Attack
- **Initiative:** Kallisar 18 → Stirges 15 → Frognar 12 → Durnan/Troll 10
- **Enemies:** 1 Troll, 3 Stirges
- **Allies:** [[Durnan]] (tanked the Troll), [[Yagra Strongfist]] (flanked)
- **Key Mechanic:** Troll Regeneration — required fire damage to stop. Party discovered this through Oil + Searing Smite combo.
- **DM Ruling:** Durnan intentionally drew Troll aggro to protect Level 1 party. Troll's AC reduced when grappled by Durnan.
- **Notable Rolls:** Frognar Nat 9+5=14 hit on Troll (18 total damage), Frognar Athletics 16 for shove, Kallisar 17+3=20 for final Stirge kill.

## Decisions & Consequences
- **Observed the brawl instead of intervening** → Neutral relationship with both Yagra and Krentz. Neither owes the party.
- **Frognar was drunk (Poisoned) in combat** → Led to comedic moments but cost an action to cure. Party learned the value of Lay on Hands.
- **Passed oil to Frognar instead of solo trick-shot** → Established teamwork over flashy solo plays.
- **Krentz's escape unresolved** → He may flee or be confronted. Open thread.
- **Volo's offer unresolved** → Main campaign hook pending.

## Loot & Progression
- **XP/Milestone:** Level 1 (Character Creation Complete)
- **Items Gained:** None
- **Items Lost/Used:** Oil flask (used on Troll), 1 Lay on Hands charge (5 HP pool), 1 spell slot (Searing Smite), 1 crossbow bolt

## Notable Quotes
- *"Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?"* — [[Krentz]]
- *"To arms! Keep it away from the tables!"* — [[Durnan]]
- *"The girl! Get the bug off the girl and find me some fire, or this beast'll never die!"* — [[Durnan]]
- *"Do it now, lad! Burn the damn thing!"* — [[Durnan]]
- *"I'll keep the big one busy! You lot handle the pests and find some gods-damned fire!"* — [[Yagra Strongfist]]
- *"Not bad for a couple of newcomers. You've got iron in your blood."* — [[Durnan]]
- *"Astounding! Simply marvelous!"* — [[Volothamp Geddarm]]

## DM Notes
- The "Odd Couple" dynamic is fantastic — lean into it.
- Kallisar's player wants Investigation-based combat — design encounters with environmental objects (chandeliers, oil, tables).
- Frognar's gambling debt can be tied to [[Cassalanters]] or [[Zhentarim]].
- For next session: Start with Volo's response, then potentially the City Watch arrival.
- Have the **Code Legal** ready as a handout.
