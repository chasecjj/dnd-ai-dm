# Waterdeep — The City of Splendors

## Overview
Waterdeep is the greatest and most cosmopolitan city in all of Faerûn. It sits on the Sword Coast and serves as its economic and cultural hub. The city is divided into distinct wards, each with its own character.

## Wards
- **Castle Ward** — The civic heart: Castle Waterdeep, government buildings, temples, and the [[Yawning Portal]].
- **North Ward** — Wealthy residential area. Noble estates and fine homes.
- **Sea Ward** — The wealthiest ward. Grand temples, arenas, and seaside estates.
- **Trades Ward** — Commercial center. Shops, guildhalls, markets.
- **South Ward** — Working-class district. Warehouses, modest homes, day laborers.
- **Dock Ward** — The roughest area. Docks, taverns, sailors, and smuggling operations.
- **City of the Dead** — A walled cemetery. Peaceful by day, dangerous by night.

## Law & Order
- Waterdeep is governed by the **Lords of Waterdeep** — a council of masked lords whose identities are secret.
- The **Open Lord** (currently Laeral Silverhand) is the only publicly known member.
- The **City Watch** enforces the law. The **City Guard** defends against external threats.
- The **Code Legal** governs behavior — strict but fair. Carrying weapons is legal but violence is not.

## Key Factions in Play
- [[Zhentarim]] — The Black Network. Merchants and mercenaries with criminal ties.
- [[Xanathar Guild]] — A beholder-led thieves' guild operating from beneath the city.
- More factions will become relevant as the story progresses.

## DM Notes
- Dragon Heist is a city-based adventure — encourage exploration of different wards.
- The faction conflict (Zhentarim vs Xanathar) is the backdrop of the main plot.
