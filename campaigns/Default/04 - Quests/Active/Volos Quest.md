# Volo's Quest

## Objective
_Not yet revealed — Volo has offered a job but the party has not accepted yet._

## Background
After witnessing the party's bravery during the [[Troll Attack]], [[Volothamp Geddarm]] approached them with *"a matter of some urgency."* He offered to buy them a round and discuss the job.

## Progress
- [ ] Accept or decline Volo's offer
- [ ] Learn the details of the quest

## DM Notes
- This is the **Dragon Heist main quest hook.**
- Volo will ask the party to find his friend **Floon Blagmaar**, who has gone missing.
- The search for Floon will lead the party into the conflict between the [[Zhentarim]] and the [[Xanathar Guild]].
- Volo's reward will ultimately be **Trollskull Manor** — a run-down tavern the party can renovate.
