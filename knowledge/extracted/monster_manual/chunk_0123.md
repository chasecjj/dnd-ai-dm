The warlike githyanki and the contemplative githzerai 
are a sundered people- two cultures that utterly despise 
one another. Before there were githyanki or githzerai, 
these creatures were a single race enslaved by the mind 
flayers. Although they attempted to overthrow their 
masters many times, their rebellions were repeatedly 
crushed until a great leader named Gith arose. 
After much bloodshed, Gith and her followers threw 
off the yoke of their illithid masters, but another leader 
named Zerthimon emerged in the aftermath of battle. 
Zerthimon challenged Gith's motives, claiming that 
her strict martial leadership and desire for vengeance 
amounted to little more than another form of slavery 
for her people. A rift erupted between followers of each 
leader, and they eventually became the two races whose 
enmity endures to this day. 
Whether these tall, gaunt creatures were peaceful or 
savage, cultured or primitive before the mind flayers 
enslaved and changed them, none can say. Not even 
the original name of their race remains from that 
distant time. 
GITHYANKI 
The githyanki plunder countless worlds from the decks 
of their astral vessels and the backs of red dragons. 
Feathers, beads, gems, and precious metals decorate 
their armor and weapons- the legendary silver swords 
with which they cut through their foes. Since winning 
their freedom from the mind flayers, the githyanki have 
become ruthless conquerors under the rulership of their 
dread lich-queen, Vlaakith. 
Astral Raiders. The githyanki despise all other races, 
undertaking devastating raids that take them from their 
strongholds in the Astral Plane to the farflung corners 
of the multiverse. War is the ultimate expression of 
githyanki culture, and their pitiless black eyes know 
no mercy. After a raid, they leave shattered survivors 
enough food and resources to weakly endure. Later, the 
githyanki return to their conquered foes, plundering 
them again and again. 
Followers ofGith. In their own language, githyanki 
·means "followers of Gith." Under the guidance of Gith, 
the githyanki stratified into a militaristic society, with 
a strict caste system, dedicated to the ongoing fight 
against the victims and sworn enemies of their race. 
When their leader Gith perished, she was replaced by 
her undead adviser, Vlaakith. The lich-queen forbade 
worship of all beings except herself. 
Of all their enemies, the githyanki most hate their 
former masters, the mind flayers. Their close kin, 
the githzerai, are second in their enmity. All other 
creatures are treated with simple contempt by the 
githyanki, whose xenophobic pride defines their view of 
inferior races. 
Silver Swords. In ancient times, gith knights created 
special weapons to combat their mind Hayer masters. 
These silver swords channel the force of the wielder's 
will, dealing psychic as well as physical damage. A 
githyanki can't become a knight until it masters the 
singular discipline needed to will such a blade into

existence. A silver sword is equivalent to a greatsword, 
and takes on the properties of a +3 greatsword in the 
hands of its creator. 
In the eyes of the githyanki, each silver sword is a 
priceless relic and a work of art. Githyanki knights 
will hunt down and destroy any non-githyanki that 
dares to carry or wield a silver sword, reclaiming it for 
their people. 
Red Dragon Riders. In the uprising against the 
illithids, Gith sought allies. Her adviser Vlaakith 
appealed to Tiamat, the goddess of evil dragonkind, and 
Gith ventured into the Nine Hells to meet with her. Only 
Tiamat now knows what passed between them, but Gith 
returned to the Astral Plane with the Dragon Queen's 
red dragon consort Ephelomon, who proclaimed that his 
kind would forever act as allies to the githyanki. Not all 
red dragons honor the alliance kindled so long ago, but 
most at least don't consider the githyanki their enemies. 
Outposts in the Mortal Realm. Since creatures 
that dwell on the Astral Plane don't age, the githyanki 
establish creches in remote areas of the Material Plane 
to raise their young. Doubling as military academies, 
these creches train young githyanki to harness their 
psychic and combat abilities. When a githyanki grows 
to adulthood and slays a mind flayer as part of a sacred 
rite of passage, it is permitted to rejoin its people on the 
Astral Plane. 
GITHZERAI 
Focused philosophers and austere ascetics, the 
githzerai pursue lives of rigid order. Lean and muscular, 
they wear unadorned clothing free of ornamentation, 
keeping their own counsel and trusting few creatures 
outside of their own kind. Having turned their backs 
on their warlike githyanki kin, the githzerai maintain a 
strict monastic lifestyle, dwelling on islands of order in 
the vast sea of chaos that is the plane of Limbo. 
Psionic Adepts. The progenitors of the githzerai 
adapted to- and were transformed by- the psychic 
environment imposed on them by their illithid 
overlords. Under the teachings of Zerthimon, who 
called on his people to abandon the warlike ambitions 
of Gith, the githzerai focused their mental energy 
on creating physical and psychic barriers to protect 
them from attack, psychic or otherwise. Fighting is 
personal to a githzerai, which uses its mind to daze 
and incapacitate opponents, leaving them vulnerable to 
physical punishment. 
Order amid Chaos. The githzerai willingly dwell in 
the heart of utter chaos in Limbo- a twisting, mercurial 
plane prone to manipulation and subjugation by 
githzerai minds strong enough to master it. Limbo is 
a maelstrom of primal matter and energy, its terrain a 
storm of rock and earth swept up in torrents of murky 
liquid, buffeted by strong winds, blasted by fire, and 
chilled by crushing walls of ice. 
The forces of Limbo react to sentience, however. 
Using the power of their minds, the githzerai tame the 
plane's chaotic elements, causing them to settle into 
fixed and survivable forms and creating oases and 
sanctuaries within the maelstrom. 
Githzerai fortress-monasteries stand resolute against 
the chaos that surrounds them, virtually impervious 
to the turmoil of their surroundings, because the 
githzerai will it. Each monastery is overseen by monks 
that impose a strict schedule of chants, meals, martial 
arts training, and devotions according to their own 
philosophy. Behind their psionically fortified walls, the 
githzerai embrace thought, learning, psionic power, 
order, and discipline above all other things. 
., ', 
The social hierarchy of the githzerai is based on merit, 
and those githzerai who are the wisest teachers and 
the most skilled at physical and mental combat become 
leaders. The githzerai revere great heroes and teachers 
of the past, emulating those figures' virtues in their 
everyday lives. 
Disciples ofZerthimon. Githzerai revere Zerthimon, 
the founder of their race. Although Gith won their 
people's freedom, Zerthimon saw her as unfit to lead. 
He believed that her warmongering would soon make 
her a tyrant no better than the mind flayers. 
Skilled githzerai monks that best exemplify the 
teachings and principles of Zerthimon are called zerths. 
These powerful and disciplined monks can shift their 
bodies from one plane to another using only the power 
of their minds. 
Beyond Limbo. Though githzerai rarely deal with 
the realms beyond Limbo, advanced monks of other 
races sometimes seek out a githzerai monastery and 
attempt to gain admittance as students. More rarely, a 
githzerai master establishes a hidden monastery on the 
Material Plane to train young githzerai or to spread the 
philosophy and teachings of Zerthimon. 
As disciplined as they are, the githzerai have never 
forgotten their long imprisonment by the mind flayers. 
As a special devotion, they organize a rrakkma- an 
illithid hunting party-to other planes, not returning 
to their monasteries until they slay at least as many 
illithids as there are hunters in the party.
