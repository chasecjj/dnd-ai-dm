COPPER DRAGON 
Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, 
and riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite 
, their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they 
possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become 
dangerous when their hoards are threatened. 
A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, 
extending back to long horns that grow as a series 
of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges 
and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper 
dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. 
As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in 
color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper 
dragon's pupils fade with age, and .the eyes of the oldest 
copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs. 
Good Hosts. A copper dragon appreciates wit, a 
good joke, humorous .story, or riddle. A copper dragon 
becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh 
at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor. 
Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A 
dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary 
abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, 
and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a 
treasure to be coveted.

Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6). The dragon uses one of the

Acid Breath. The dragon exhales acid in an 20-foot line that 
is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Slowing Breath. The dragon exhales gas in a 1 5-foot cone. Each 
creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use 
reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than 
one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either 
an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These 
effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on 
itself with a successful save.

Cautious a;,d Crafty. When building its hoard, a 
copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals 
and precious stones are favorites of these creatures. 
A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off 
its possessions. If it knows that other creatures seek a 
specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit 
to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious 
treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the 
object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure. 
A CoPPER DRAGON's LAIR 
Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, 
where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False 
walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the 
dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other 
oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless 
items are put on display in open caves to tantalize 
treasure seekers and distract them from where the real 
treasure is hidden. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: 
The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can 
see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the 
ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The 
effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell 
and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or 
until the dragon dies. 
The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the 
ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground 
in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature 
on the ground in that area when the mud appears 
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or 
sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature 
can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, 
freeing itself or another creature within its reach and 
ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 
1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initia-
tive count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and 
the Strength DC to work free increases to 20. 
· REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair 
is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or 
more of the following effects: 
• Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be 
seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 
miles of the dragon's lair. 
• Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are nor-
mally unable to speak gain the magical ability to 
speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile 
of the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the 
dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts. 
Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair 
are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters sud-
denly seem amusing. 
If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the 
course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately.
