HALF :... DRAGON 
When a drago~· in polymorphed form mates with 
another creature, the union sometimes produces half-
dragon offspring. A creature might also transform into 
a half-dragon as a result of a mad wizard's spell or a 
ritual bath in dragon's blood. In all these cases, the 
result is a creature that combines the 
essence of a dragon with the form of its 
original race. Regardless of their origins, 
all half-dragons have similar features and 
appearance, gaining special senses, resistance to 
destructive energy, and a breath weapon. 
Draconic Nature. Half-dragons are incapable 
of having natural born offspring. Those that wish 
to propagate must find other ways to do so, almost 
always involving magic. By way of compensation, half-
dragons are blessed with long life. Barring unforeseen 
misfortune, a typical half-dragon's life expectancy is 
twice that of its nondraconic line, so that a half-dragon 
human might live more than a century and a half. 
Half-dragons inherit personality traits common to 
their draconic heritage, so that half-gold dragons are 
often shy and secretive, while half-copper dragons are 
impish and playful. Half-green dragons are deceitful, 
while half-white dragons are often dim-witted brutes. 
These traits are tempered by a half-dragon's other 
lineage, but greed, arrogance, and paranoia are qualities 
that even good-aligned half-dragons often possess.
