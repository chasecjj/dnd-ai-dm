A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its 
lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken 
ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes 
struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to 
perch and destroys them with its freezing breath. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; 
the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
• Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on 
a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The 
fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily 
obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears 
must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 
10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its 
turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of 
at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog 
otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action 
again or until the dragon dies. 
• Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to 
three creatures underneath that the dragon can see 
within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged 
attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the 
target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. 
• The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid 
surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can 
be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. 
When the wall appears, each creature within its area 
is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on 
whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot sec-
tion of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability 
to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, 
poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears 
when the dragon uses this lair action again or when 
the dragon dies. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing a legendary white dragon's lair 
is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or 
more of the following effects: 
Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of 
the dragon's lair. 
• Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the drag-
on's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when 
the dragon is at rest. 
• Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall 
is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit 
points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to 
acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. 
If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can 
do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall 
the dragon moves through is destroyed, however. 
If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 
1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days. 
METALLIC DRAGONS 
Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing 
themselves as one powerful race among the many races 
that have a place in the world. 
Noble Curiosity. Metallic dragons covet treasure 
as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven 
as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, 
metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, 
taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their Ja1rs. 
A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items . 
that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its 
memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect othe~ 
creatures from dangerous magic. As such, power.ful 
magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes 
secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard. 
A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an 
item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another 
creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear 
from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must 
be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item. 
Solitary Shapeshifters. At some point in their long 
lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to 
assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a 
dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse 
itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too 
shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their 
treasure hoards, but bolder dragons Jove to wander city 
streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and 
cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the 
smaller races live. 
Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from 
civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. 
However, this means that they are often far out of touch 
with current events. 
The Persistence of Memory. Metallic dragons 
have long memories, and they form opinions of 
humanoids based on previous contact with related 
humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid 
bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet 
and remembering any relatives they have come into 
contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never 
suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming 
that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good 
and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the 
dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor 
stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three 
centuries before. 
King of Good Dragons. The chief deity of the metallic 
dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in 
the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders 
the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable 
human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually 
accompanied by seven golden canaries- actually seven 
ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form. 
Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal 
creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart 
the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and 
her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins 
sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to 
justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power . 
to grant divine spells.
