the surface world the way humanoids might behave 
in their own dreams, making little account for their 
actions and never fully trusting what they see or hear. A 
promise made above ground need not be kept. Insults 
can be made without apology. Killing prey or sentient 
beings is no cause for guilt in the dreaming world 
beneath the sky. 
Stone giants lacking in athletic grace or artistic skill 
dwell at the fringes of their society, serving as the tribe's 
outlying guardians and far-wandering hunters. When 
trespassers stray too far into the mountain territory of a 
stone giant clan, those guardians greet them with hurled 
rocks and showers of splintered stone. Survivors of such 
encounters spread tales of stone giant violence, never 
realizing how little those brutes dwelling in the unreal 
dreaming world resemble their quiet and artistic kin. 
STORM GIANT 
Storm giants are contemplative seers that live in places 
far removed from mortal civilization. Most have pale 
pmple-gray skin and hair, and glittering emerald eyes. 
Some rare storm giants are violet-skinned, with deep 
violet or blue-black hair and silvery gray or purple 
GIANT Goos 
When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all 
giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to 
look upon either again until the giants had returned to their 
glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As 
a result, giants pray not to Ann am but to his divine children, 
along with a host of hero-deities and godly viUains that make 
up the giants' pantheon. 
Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose 
sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm 
giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for 
stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, 
and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically 
revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud 
giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm 
giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay 
more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel 
a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include 
Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; lallanis, goddess 
of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and 
arrogant trickster. 
Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to 
demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. 
To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great 
sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a 
giant an outcast. 
eyes. They are benevolent and wise unless angered, in 
response to which the fury of a storm giant can affect 
the fate of thousands. 
Distant Prophet-Kings. Storm giants live in isolated 
refuges so far above the surface of the world or below 
the sea that they are beyond the reach of most other 
creatures. Some make their abodes in cloud-top 
castles so high that flying dragons appear as specks 
below. Others live atop mountain peaks that pierce the 
clouds. Some occupy palaces covered with algae and 
coral at the bottom of the ocean, or grim fortresses in 
undersea rifts. 
l 
Detached Oracles. Storm giants recall the glory of 
ancient giant empires forged by the god Annam. They 
seek to restore what was lost when those empires.fell. 
They don't compete for status in the ordning but live 
out the centuries of their existence in contemplative 
seclusion, watching the starry heavens and the ocean's 
depths for signs, symbols, and omens of Annam's favor. 
Storm giants see the events of the world in a wide 
perspective. They can foretell the rise and fall of kings 
and empires, see the beginnings and ends of fortune 
and disaster, and find the patterns within seemingly 
unrelated events. By reading omens and prophesying, 
storm giants learn of vast secrets previously unknown 
and troves of lore utterly forgotten. 
Kings will rise and fall, wars will be won and lost, 
and good and evil will wrestle in conflict. Storm giants 
have watched these events in the manner of mortal 
gods over many lifetimes, and they know it is pointless 
to intervene. Even so, a storm giant might willingly 
disclose certain secrets to benevolent beings that visit 
its remote domain with specific purpose. Such creatures 
must speak and act respectfully, however, for a storm 
giant roused to anger is a force of utter destruction. 
Solitary Lives. Storm giants communicate 
infrequently with others of their kind. They do so 
usually to compare signs and omens or engage in a rare 
courtship. Storm giant parents stay together to raise a 
child to maturity, then return to the solitary isolation 
they cherish. 
Some humanoid cultures worship storm giants as 
they would worship lesser gods, creating myths and 
stories around the giants' exploits and vast knowledge. 
A storm giant is governed by the dictates of its 
conscience, however, and not by any culture's laws or 
codes of honor. As such, a storm giant that bends its 
mind toward greed or gains a taste for petty power can 
easily become a terrible threat.
