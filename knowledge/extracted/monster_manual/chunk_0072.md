on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a

the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for

half as much damage on a successful one. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the 
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used 
at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The 
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. 
Detect. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack. 
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. 
Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed

then fly up to half its flying speed.
