Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light 
and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp 
underground, feeding on any creature or object that 
can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping 
from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges 
of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks. 
The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's 
presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch. 
Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic 
material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they 
feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know 
that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign 
that an ooze lairs nearby. 
Slow Death. An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some 
varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, 
engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside 
1 of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can 
come to the rescue before it is too late. 
Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, 
some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris 
suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze 
can be a rich source of treasure for its killers. 
Unwitting Servants. Although an ooze lacks the 
intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that 
understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a 
location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters 
keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume 
refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, 
where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from 
coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and 
flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze 
from leaving a particular tunnel or room. 
Spawn ofjuiblex. According to the Demonomicon 
of Jggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered 
fragments or offspring of the demon lordjuiblex. 
Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one 
of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue 
them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, 
oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. 
They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating 
without cunning. Under the control ofjuiblex, they 
ex.hibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent. 
Ooze Nature. An ooze doesn't require sleep. 
VARIANT: PSYCHIC GRAY OOZE 
A gray ooze that lives a long time can evolve to become 
more intelligent and develop limited psionic ability. Such 
occurrences are more common in gray oozes that live near 
psionic creatures such as mind flayers, suggesting that the 
ooze can sense and mimic psionic ability. 
A psionic gray ooze has an Intelligence score of6 (-2), as 
well as the following additional action. 
Psychic Crush (Recharge 5-6). The ooze targets one 
creature that it can sense within 60 feet of it. The target must 
make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) 
psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on 
a successful one.

A black pudding resefllbles a heaving mound of sticky 
black sludge. In dim passageways, the pudding appears 
to be little more than a blot of shadow. 
Flesh, wood, metal, and bone dissolve when the 
pudding ebbs over them. Stone remains behind, 
wiped clean. 
GELATINOUS CUBE 
Gelatinous cubes scour dungeon passages in silent, 
predictable patterns, leaving perfectly clean paths in 
their wake. They consume living tissue while leaving 
bones and other materials undissolved. 
A gelatinous cube is all but transparent, making 
it hard to spot until it attacks. A cube that is well 
fei:l can be easier to spot, since its victims' bones, 
coins, and other 9bjects can be seen suspended 
inside the creature. 
· 
GRAY OozE 
A gray ooze is stone turned to liquid by 
chaos. When it moves, it slithers 
like a liquid snake, fising to strike. 
OCHRE JELLY 
Ochre jellies are yellowish blobs that can 
slide under doors and through narrow 
cracks in pursuit of creatures to devour. 
They have enough.bestial cunning to 
avoid large groups of enemies. 
An ochre jelly follows at a safe distance 
as it pursues its meal. Its digestive enzymes 
dissolve flesh quickly but have no effect on other 
substances such as bone, wood, and metal.

with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1 d8) acid 
damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that 
hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon 
takes a permanent 
cumulative -~ penalty to damage r0lls.

destroyed after dealing damage.

target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid

is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 
penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty 
reduces its ACto 10. 
REACTIONS 
Split. When a pudding that is Medium or larger is subjected to 
lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new puddings 
if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new pudding has hit points 
equal to half the original pudding's, rounded down. New 
puddings are one size smaller than the original pudding.
