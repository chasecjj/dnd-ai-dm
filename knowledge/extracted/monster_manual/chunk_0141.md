Beast Trainers. Hobgoblins have a long history of 
training animals to service. Like the more civilized 
races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods 
and weaponry over long distances. They communicate 
with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious 
wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. 
Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the 
same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even 
keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts. 
Conquer and Control. Hobgoblins claim lands 
with abundant resources, and they can be found in 
forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid 
settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and 
potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer

strongholds il} ~trategically advaritageous locations, 
which they then use as staging areas to expand 
their territory. 
Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but 
they don't take up arms lightly. Before they attack, 
hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge 
the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When 
assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off 
escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their 
enemies out. 
Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering 
existing defenses with innovations of their own. 
Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, 
ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with 
ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude 
catapults or ballistas. 
Legion ofMaglubiyet. Hobgoblins worship 
Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of 
goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins 
don't fear death, believing that when they die in battle, 
their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army 
on the plane of Acheron.

Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). For 1 
minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning 
whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet 
of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can 
add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the 
hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die 
at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated.
