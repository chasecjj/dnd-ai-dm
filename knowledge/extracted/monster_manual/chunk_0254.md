would hit it. To do so, the noble must see the attacker and be

that can make them as powerful as monarchs and 
generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, 
as well as servants who are commoners. 
The noble's statistics can also be used to represent 
courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

Priests bring the teachings of their 
gods to the common folk. They are 
the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines 
and often hold positions of influence in their 
communities. Evil priests might work openly 
under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of 
religious sects hidden in the shadows of good 
society, overseeing depraved rites. 
A priest typically has one or more acolytes 
to help with religious ceremonies and other 
sacred duties.

a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly 
gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than 
divulge information that could compromise them or 
their employers.
