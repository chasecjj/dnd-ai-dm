Devil's Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's 
darkvision. 
Magic Resistance. The devil has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Chain. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled 
(escape DC 14) if the devil isn't already grappling a creature. 
Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 7 
(2d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. 
Animate Chains (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). Up 
to four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically 
sp.rout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil's 
control, provided that the chains aren't being worn or carried. 
Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, 
resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and 
thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, 
it can use each animated chain to make one additional chain 
attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own 
but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain 
reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if the 
devil is incapacitated or dies. 
REACTIONS 
Unnerving Mask. When a creature the devil can see starts its 
turn within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can create the illusion 
that it looks like one of the creature's departed loved o.nes 
or bitter enemies. If the creature can see the devil, it must 
succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened 
until the end of its turn.
