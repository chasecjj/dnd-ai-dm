STIRGE 
This horrid flying creature looks like a cross between 
a large bat and an oversized mosquito. Its legs end 
in sharp pincers, and its long, needle-like proboscis 
slashes the air as it seeks its next meal. 
Stirges feed on the blood of living creatures, attaching 
and draining them slowly. Although they pose little 
danger in small numbers, packs of stirges can be 
a formidable threat, reattaching as quickly as their 
weakening prey can pluck them off. 
Blood Drain. A stirge attacks by landing on a victim, 
finding a vulnerable spot, and plunging its proboscis 
into the flesh while using its pincer legs to latch on to the 
victim. Once the stirge has sated itself, it detaches and 
flies off to digest its meal.

Blood Drain. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
creature. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the stirge 
attaches to the target. While attached, the stirge doesn't 
attack. Instead, at the start of each of the stirge's turns, the 
target loses 5 (1 d4 + 3) hit points due to blood loss. 
The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its 
movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from 
the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, 
can use its action to detach the stirge.

Sue cue us/INcuBus 
Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, 
and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in 
service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and 
yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses 
these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The 
demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers 
and consorts. 
Though legend speaks of them separately, any 
succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most 
of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the 
other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in 
its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its 
corruption in veiled, insidious ways. 
Beautiful Corrupters. A succubus or incubus first 
appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like 
a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper 
forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to 
give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and 
feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's 
dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes 
more susceptible to temptation in everyday life. 
Inevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in 
tempting form to directly influence a creature's 
actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has 
previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the 
succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, 
indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its 
own free will. 
A mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal 
pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus 
has corrupted a creature completely- some say by 
causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of 
thought, word, and deed- the victim's soul belongs 
to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the 
longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding 
the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, 
the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul 
descends into the Lower Planes. 
The succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim 
magically only when necessary, usually as a form of 
self-defense. A charmed creature isn't responsible 
for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will 
won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the 
victim's soul. 
Deadly Kiss. The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an 
echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a 
corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss 
gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and 
the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss 
is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final 
farewell before the fiend escapes. 
FiendishOJfspring.Succubiandincubican 
reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. 
Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with 
a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is 
conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked 
as its fiendish parent.
