WATER WEIRD 
A water weird is an elemental guardian bound to a 
specific water-filled location, such as a pool or founfain. 
Invisible while immersed in water, its serpentine shape 
becomes clear only when it emerges to attack, using its 
coils to crush any creature other than its summoner and 
those its summoner declares as off limits. When slain, a 
water weird becomes an inanimate pool of water. 
Good and Evil Weirds. Like most elementals, a 
water weird has no concept of good or evil. However, 
a water weird bound to a sacred or befouled source of 
water begins to take on the nature of that site, becoming 
neutral good or neutral evil. 
A neutral good water weird tries to frighten away 
interlopers rather than kill them, while a neutral evil 
water weird kills its victims for pleasure and might 
turn against its summoner. A water weird loses its evil 
alignment if its waters are cleansed with a purify food 
and drink spell. 
Elemental Nature. A water weird doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.

Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) and pulled 5 
feet toward the water weird. Until this grapple ends, the target 
is restrained, the water weird tries to drown it, and the water 
weird can't constrict another target.

WIGHT 
The word "wight" meant "person" in days of yore, but 
the name now refers to evil undead who were once 
mortals driven by dark desire and great vanity. When 
death stills such a creature's heart and snuffs its living 
breath, its spirit cries out to the demon lord Orcus or 
some vile god of the underworld for a reprieve: undeath 
in return for eternal war on the living. If a dark power 
answers the call, the spirit is granted undeath so that it 
can pursue its own malevolent agenda. 
Wights possess the memories and drives of their 
formerly living selves. They will heed the call of 
whatever dark entity transformed them into undead, 
swearing oaths to appease their new lord while 
retaining their autonomy. Never tiring, a wight can 
pursue its goals relentlessly and without distraction. 
Life Eaters. Neither dead nor alive, a wight exists in a 
transitional state between one world and the next. The 
bright spark it possessed in life is gone, and in its place 
is a yearning to consume that spark in all living things. 
When a wight attacks, this life essence glows like white-
hot embers to its dark eyes, and the wight's cold touch 
can drain the spark through flesh, clothing, and armor. 
Shadow of the Grave. Wights flee from the world 
by day, away from the light of the sun, which they hate. 
They retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, and tombs 
where they dwell. Their lairs are silent, desolate places, 
surrounded by dead plants, noticeably blackened, and 
avoided by bird and beast. 
Humanoids slain by a wight can rise as zombies 
under its control. Motivated by hunger for living souls 
and driven by the same desire for power that awakened 
them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops 
for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are 
able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger 
for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands 
before them. 
Undead Nature. A wight doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep.

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the wight has 
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks that rely on sight. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The wight makes two longsword attacks or 
two longbow attacks. It can use its Life Drain in place of one 
longsword attack. 
Life Drain. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must 
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point 
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. 
This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The 
target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. 
A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a 
zombie under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is 
restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no 
more than twelve zombies under its control at one time. 
Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) 
slashing damage if used with two hands. 
Longbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., 
one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.
