YUAN -TI PUREBLOOD 
Purebloods form the lowest caste of yuan-ti society. 
They closely resemble humans, yet a pureblood 
can't pass for human under close scrutiny because 
there's always some hint of its true nature, such as 
scaly patches of skin, serpentine eyes, pointed teeth, 
or a forked tongue. Wearing cloaks and cowls, they 
masquerade as humans and infiltrate civilized lands to 
gather information, kidnap prisoners for interrogation 
and sacrifice, and trade with anyone who has something 
that can further their myriad plots. 
•= 
1 SERPENT Coos 
The yuan-ti revere a number of powerful entities as gods, 
including the following. 
Dendar, the Night Serpent. Dendar's followers say that 
one day she will grow so large from feasting on the fears and 
nightmares of the world that she will devour it whole. Yuan-ti 
that serve Dendar terrorize other creatures in any way they 
can, growing and nurturing the fears of humanoids to feed 
the Night Serpent. 
Merrshaulk, Master of the Pit. Merrshaulk is the long-
slumbering chief deity of the yuan-ti. As worship of 
Merrshaulk waned, he went into slumber. Merrshaulk's 
priests are yuan-ti abominations that maintain traditions of 
living sacrifice and cause suffering in the god's name. With 
enough vile acts, the abominations believe that Merrshaulk 
will reawaken and restore the yuan-ti to their rightful place. 
Sseth, the Sibilant Death. Sseth appeared to the yuan-ti 
of antiquity in the form of a winged yuan-ti claiming to be 
an avatar of Merrshaulk. Speaking with Merrshaulk's voice, 
Sseth vowed to pull the yuan-ti out of decline and build a 
new empire. Many of Merrshaulk's devout turned to the 
worship of Sseth. Some yuan-ti have long suspected Sseth 
as an usurper taking advantage of Merrshaulk's slumber 
to make himself a god. They believe that Sseth might even 
have devoured Merrshaulk, and now answers the prayers of 
Merrshaulk's followers, as his priests convert or consume 
I Merrshaulk's more stubborn adherents.

YUGOLOTHS 
Yugoloths are fickle fiends that inhabit the planes 
of Acheron, Gehenna, Hades, and Carceri. They act 
as mercenaries and are notorious for their shifting 
loyalties. They are the embodiments of avarice. Before 
serving under anyone's banner, a yugoloth asks the only 
question on its mind: What's in it for me? 
Spawn ofGehenna. The first yugoloths were 
created by a sisterhood of night hags on Gehenna. It 
is widely believed that Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine 
Hells, commissioned the work, in the hope of creating 
an army of fiends that were not bound to the Nine 
Hells. In the course of making this new army, the hags 
crafted four magic tomes and recorded the true names 
of every yugoloth they created, save one, the General 
of Gehenna. These tomes were called the Books of 
Keeping. Since knowing a fiend's true name grants 
power over it, the hags used the books to ensure the 
yugoloths' loyalty. They also used the books to capture 
the true names of other fiends that crossed them. It is 
rumored that the Books of Keeping contain the true 
names of a few demon lords and arch devils as well. 
Petty jealousies and endless bickering caused 
the sisterhood to dissolve, and in the ensuing power 
grab, the Books of Keeping were lost or stolen. No 
longer indentured to anyone, the yugoloths gained 
independence, and they now offer their services to the 
highest bidder. 
Fiendish Mercenaries. Summoned yugoloths 
demand much for their time and loyalty. Whatever 
promise;; a yugoloth makes are quickly broken when 
a better opportunity presents itself. Unlike demons, 
yugoloths can be reasoned with, but unlike devils, they 
are rarely true to their word. 
Yugoloths can be found anywhere, but the high cost of 
maintaining a yugoloth army's loyalty typically exceeds 
what any warlord on the Material Plane can pay. 
Being self-serving creatures, yugoloths quarrel 
among themselves constantly. A yugoloth army is more 
organized than a ravening horde of demons, but far less 
orderly and regimented than a legion of devils. Without 
a powerful leader to keep them in line, yugoloths fight 
simply to indulge their violent predilections, and only as 
long as it benefits them to do so. 
Back to Gehenna. When a yugoloth dies, it dissolves 
into a pool of ichor and reforms at full strength on the 
Bleak Eternity of Gehenna. Only on its native plane 
can a yugoloth be destroyed permanently. A yugoloth 
knows this and acts accordingly. When summoned to 
other planes, a yugoloth fights without concern for its 
own well-being. On Gehenna, it is more apt to retreat or 
plead for mercy if its demise seems imminent. 
When a yugoloth is permanently destroyed, its name 
vanishes from every Book of Keeping. If a yugoloth 
is re-created by way of an unholy ritual requiring the 
expenditure of souls, its name reappears in the books. 
The Books of Keeping. When all four copies of the 
Books of Keeping disappeared, Asmodeus and ·the night 
hags lost control of their yugoloth creations. Each Book 
of Keeping still exists, drifting from plane to plane, 
where the brave.and the foolish occasionally stumble 
upon them. A yugoloth summoned using its true name, 
as inscribed in the Books of Keeping, is forced to serve 
its summoner obediently. The yugoloth hates being 
controlled in this manner and isn't shy about making 
its displeasure known. Like a petulant child, it will 
follow its instructions to the letter while looking for 
opportunities to misinterpret them. 
r 
The General ofGehenna. Somewhere in the 
brimstone wastes of Gehenna, there roams an ultrploth 
so strong that none contests his power: the General of 
Gehenna. Many yugoloths search for this great general 
in the hope of serving with him. They believe that,. 
,. 
service with the General of Gehenna grants p0\ve~ and 
prestige among lower planar entities. 
' 
Whatever the case, no fiend finds the General unless 
the General desires it. His personal name is unknOWN, 
and even the Books of Keeping contain no mention of ' 
this powerful, thoroughly evil entity. 
ARCANA LOTH 
Arcanaloths are sly, jackal-headed beings with 
humanoid bodies, but they can employ magic to take any 
humanoid form. They do so to gain the trust of creatures 
with whom they negotiate, replacing jackal snarls with 
winsome smiles. 
Regardless of its chosen form, an arcanaloth appears 
well groomed, clothing itself in fine robes. Highly 
intelligent spellcasters who hunger for knowledge and 
power, arcanaloths command units of lesser yugoloths 
and maintain the contracts, records, and accounts 
of their kind. 
Arcanaloths speak and write all languages, making 
them cunning diplomats and negotiators. An arcanaloth 
properly paid can broker treaties or alliances with 
subtlety and finesse, just as an arcana loth who changes 
sides can easily turn the best-laid peace talks into all-out 
war. What the fiend demands in exchange for its time 
and talent is information, as well as powerful magic 
items that it can trade for even more information. 
VARIANT: YUGOLOTH SUMMONING 
Some yugoloths have an action option that allows them to 
summon other yugoloths. 
Summon Yugoloth (1jDay)- The yugoloth chooses what to 
summon and attempts a magical summoning. 
• An arcanaloth has a 40 percent chance of summoning 
one arcanaloth. 
• A mezzoloth has a 30 percent chance of summoning 
one mezzoloth. 
• A nycaloth has a SO percent chance of summoning 1 d4 
mezzoloths or one nycaloth . 
• An ultroloth has a SO percent chance of summoning 1 d6 
mezzoloths, 1 d4 nycaloths, or one ultroloth. 
A summoned yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space 
' within 60 feet of its summoner, does as it pleases (unless 
its summoner is an ultroloth, in which case it acts as an ally 
of its summoner), and can't summon other yugoloths. The 
summoned yugoloth remains for 1 minute, until it or its 
summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a bonus action 
to dismiss it.
