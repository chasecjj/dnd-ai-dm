False Appearance. While the piercer remains motionless on the 
ceiling, it is indistinguishable from a normal stalactite.

including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 
ACTIONS 
Drop. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, one creature directly 
"

feet fallen , up to 21 (6d6). Miss: The piercer takes half the

PIERCE.R 
PIERCER 
Clinging to the ceilings of caverns and large 
subterranean passages, piercers blend in perfectly with 
natural rock, dropping in silence to impale unsuspecting 
foes on the ground below. 
A piercer is the larval form of a roper, and the two 
creatures often attack in tandem. A rock-like shell 
encases a piercer's body, giving it the look and texture 
of a stalactite. That shell protects a soft, slug-like upper 
body that lets the piercer move across cavern walls 
and ceilings to position itself for prey. With its eye and 
mouth closed, the piercer is difficult to distinguish from 
ordinary rock formations. 
Patient Hunters. Piercers can see, but they can also 
respond to noise and heat, waiting for living creatures to 
pass beneath them, then falling to attack. A piercer that 
misses its chance to kill must make its slow way back 
to the ceiling. A fallen piercer excretes a foul-smelling 
slime when attacked, making most predators think 
twice about eating it. 
Piercers gather in colonies to maximize the 
effectiveness of their attacks, dropping simultaneously 
to increase the odds of striking prey. After a piercer 
successfully slays a creature, the others slowly creep 
toward the corpse to join in the feast.

PIXIE 
Standing barely a foot tall, pixies resemble 
diminutive elves with gossamer wings like 
those of dragonflies or butterflies, bright as the 
clear dawn and as luminous as the full moonrise. 
Curious as cats and shy as deer, pixies go where 
they please. They like to spy on other creatures 
and can barely contain their excitement around 
them. The urge to introduce themselves and 
strike up a friendship is almost overwhelming; 
only a pixie's fear of being captured or attacked 
stays its hand. Those who wander through a 
pixie's glade might never see the creatures, yet 
hear the occasional giggle, gasp, or sigh. 
Pixies array themselves like princes and 
princesses of the fey, wearing flowing 
gowns and doublets of silk that sparkle 
like moonlight on a pond. Some dress 
in acorns, leaves, bark, and the pelts of 
tiny woodland beasts. They take great pride 
in their regalia and beam with joy when they are 
complimented on their ensembles. 
Magical Faerie Folk. With their innate power of 
invisibility, pixies rarely appear unless they wish to be 
seen. In the Feywild and on the Material Plane, pixies 
etch patterns of frost on winter ponds and rouse the 
buds in springtime. They cause flowers to sparkle with 
summer dew, and color the leaves with the blazing 
hues of autumn. 
Pixie Dust. When pixies fly visibly, a shower of 
sparkling dust follows in their wake like the glittering 
tail of a shooting star. A mere sprinkle of pixie dust is 
said to be able to grant the power of flight, confuse a 
creature hopelessly, or send foes into a magical slumber. 
Only pixies can use their dust to its full potential, 
but these fey are constantly sought out by mages and 
monsters seeking to study or master their power. 
Tiny Tricksters. While the arrival of visitors piques 
their curiosity, pixies are too shy to reveal themselves 
at first. They study the visitors from afar to gauge 
their temperament or play harmless tricks on them to 
measure their reactions. For example, pixies might 
tie a dwarf's boots together, create illusions of strange 
creatures or treasures, or use dancing lights to lead 
interlopers astray. If the visitors respond with hostility, 
the pixies give them a wide berth. If the visitors are 
good natured, the pixies are likely to be emboldened 
and more friendly. The fey might even emerge and offer 
to guide their "guests" along a safe route or invite them 
to a tiny yet satisfying feast prepared in their honor. 
Opposed to Violence. Unlike their fey cousins, the 
sprites, pixies abhor weapons and would sooner flee 
than get into il physical altercation with any enemy.
