Negative Energy Cone. The death tyrant's central eye emits an 
invisible, magical150-foot cone of negative energy. At the start 
of each of its turns, the tyrant decides which way the cone faces 
and whether the cone is active. 
Any creature in that area can't regain hit points. Any 
humanoid that dies there becomes a zombie under the tyrant's 
command. The dead humanoid retains its place in the initiative 
order and animates at the start of its next turn, provided that 
its body hasn't been completely destroyed. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage. 
Eye Rays. The death tyrant shoots three of the following 
magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to 
three targets it can see within 120 feet of it: 
7. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 
17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the tyrant for 1 
hour, or until the beholder harms the creature. 
2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a 
DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. 
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 
Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success. 
4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a 
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's 
speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't 
take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus 
action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself 
on a success. 
5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 
Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed 
on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the tyrant moves it up to 
30 feet in any direction. The target is restrained by the ray's 
telekinetic grip until the start of the tyrant's next turn or until 
the tyrant is incapacitated. 
If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that 
isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any 
direction. The tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with 
this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door 
or a container. 
7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 
Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious 
for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another 
creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on 
constructs and undead. 
8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 
17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins 
to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving 
throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. 
On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater 
restoration spell or other magic. 
9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must 
succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (l0d8) 
force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit 
points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. 
If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or 
creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving 
throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of 
magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10·foot cube of it. 
10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 
17 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. 
The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The death tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye 
Ray option below. It can take only one legendary action at a 
time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The tyrant 
regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
