creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or 
be knocked prone.

Charisma (spell save DC 14). The unicorn can innately cast the 
following spells, requiring no components: 
At will: detect evil and good, druidcraft, pass without trace 
1Jday each: calm emotions, dispel evil and good, entangle 
Magic Resistance. The unicorn has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects.

hooves and one with its horn.

neutralizes all poisons afflicting the target.

to three willing creatures it can see within 5 feet of it, along 
with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, to a location 
the unicorn is familiar with, up to 1 mile away.

VAMPIRES 
Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for 
the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking 
the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for 
its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or 
reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed 
among the living keeps to the darkness and far from 
reflective surfaces. 
Dark Desires. Whether or not a vampire retains 
any memories from its former life, its emotional 
attachments wither as once-pure feelings become 
twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry 
obsession, while friendship becomes bitter 
jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue 
physical symbols of what they crave, so that a 
vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. 
A child might become an object of fascination for a 
vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others 
surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items 
such as torture devices or trophies from creatures 
they have killed. 
Born from Death. Most of a vampire's victims 
become vampire spawn- ravenous creatures with a 
vampire's hunger for blood, but under the .control of 
the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows 
a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn 
transforms into a true vampire no longer under its 
master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish 
their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become 
free-willed when their creator dies. 
Chained to the Grave. Every vampire remains bound 
to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by 
day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must 
lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition 
to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by 
transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave 
dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple 
resting places this way. 
Undead Nature. Neither a vampire nor a vampire 
spawn requires air. 
The game statistics of a player character 
transformed into a vampire spawn and then a 
vampire don't change, except that the character's Strength, 
Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren't 
higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire's damage 
resistances, darkvision, traits, and actions. Attack and 
damage rolls for the vampire's attacks are based on Strength. 
The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency 
bonus+ the vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's 
alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take 
control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with 
a wish spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.
