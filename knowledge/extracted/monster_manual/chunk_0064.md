DRAGONS 
True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and 
fearsome power. They are known and feared for their 
predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons 
accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in 
the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose 
innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and 
other preternatural abilities. 
Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon 
turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall 
into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic 
dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons 
are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, 
copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and 
highly respected by the wise. 
Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all 
true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins 
and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons 
with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, 
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed. 
True dragons pass through four distinct stages of 
life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which 
can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their 
might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow 
beyond price.

VARIAN T: D RAG O NS AS I N NATE SPELLCASTERS 
Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few 
spells as they age, using this variant. 
A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of 
spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast 
once per day, requiring no material components, and the 
spell's level can be no higher than one-third the dragon's 
challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon's bonus to 
hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus+ its 
Charisma bonus. The dragon's spell save DC equals 8 +its 
proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.

CHROMAIT'IC DRAGONS 
The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent 
the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and 
vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful 
tyrants feared by all creatures- including each other. 
Driven by Greed. Chromatic dragons lust after 
treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme 
and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs 
to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that 
wealth without regard for the humanoids and other 
creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, 
gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is 
the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have 
no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other 
reason than to have it. 
Creatures of Ego. Chromatic dragons are united by 
their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most 
powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they 
interact with other creatures, it is only to further their 
own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, 
and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic 
dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble 
a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind 
to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are 
animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and 
wholly unworthy of respect. 
Dangerous Lairs. A dragon's lair serves as the seat 
of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate 
toughness and tolerance for severe environmental 
effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter 
but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, 
and security for its hoard. 
Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous 
and remote locations to prevent all but the most 
audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon 
might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red 
dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In 
addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful 
chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and 
subservient creatures to protect their treasures. 
Queen of Evil Dragons. Tiamat the Dragon Queen 
is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on 
A vern us, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser 
god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her 
worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She 
epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that 
the multi verse and all its treasures will one day be hers 
and hers alone. 
Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect 
the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-
black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the 
battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with 
her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, 
and her fearsome claws. 
Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum 
Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith 
of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for 
Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule 
of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon 
Queen's power.
