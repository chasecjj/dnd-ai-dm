Trampling Charge. If the horse moves at least 20 feet straight 
toward a creature and then hits it with a hooves attack on 
the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength 
saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the 
horse can make another attack with its hooves against it as a 
bonus action.

An armored warhorse has an AC based on the type of barding 
worn (see the Player's Handbook for more information on 
barding). The horse's AC includes its Dexterity modifier, 
where applicable. Barding doesn't alter the horse's 
challenge rating.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, 
it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be

Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6). The wolf exhales a blast of freezing 
wind in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a 
DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
The arctic-dwelling winter wolf is as large as a dire 
wolf but has snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost 
giants use these evil creatures as guards and hunting 
companions, putting the wolves' deadly breath weapon 
to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate 
with one another using growls and barks, but they 
speak Common and Giant well enough to follow simple 
conversations.

A worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and 
devouring creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and 
malevolent, worgs roam across the remote wilderness 
or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those 
creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on 
its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs 
speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn 
to speak Common as well.
