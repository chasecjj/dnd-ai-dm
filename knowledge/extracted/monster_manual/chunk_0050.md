against spells and other magical effects.

including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check.

of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target is 
incapacitated.

DEVfLS 
Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society 
dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow 
of the Nine Hells of Baa tor extends far across the 
multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness us, 
strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for 
power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal 
,armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to 
corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned. 
Lords of Tyranny. Devils live to conquer, enslave, 
and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising 
authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the 
authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. 
Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display 
its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of 
how to use and abuse their power. 
Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent 
mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals 
into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into 
slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material 
Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid 
rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, 
and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions. 
Obedience and Ambition. In accordance with their 
lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or 
dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience 
will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells 
depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that 
fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss. 
At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to 
scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses 
their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition 
is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus 
appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These 
high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample 
true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia. 
Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers. Devils are confined 
to the Lower Planes, but they can travel b_eyond those 
planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. 
They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to 
gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such 
a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators 
and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an 
agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest 
devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal 
creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its 
soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells. 
To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control 
over that creature, and most devils accept no other 
currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons 
they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a 
mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can 
wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows 
a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can 
instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its 
possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul 
after a devil has claimed it.
