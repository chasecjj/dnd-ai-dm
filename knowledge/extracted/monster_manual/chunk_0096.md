ELEMENTALS 
Elementals are incarnations of the elements that make 
up the universe: air, earth, fire, and water. Though 
little more than animated energy on their own planes 
of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and 
powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks. 
Living Elements. On its home plane, an elemental is 
a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests 
as a physical shape only when focused by the power 
of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no 
desire except to course through the element of its 
native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these 
elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little 
sense of being. 
Conjured by Magic. Certain spells and magic items 
can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner 
Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively 
resent being pulled from their native planes and bound 
into service. A creature that summons an elemental 
must assert force of will to control it. 
Bound and Shaped. Powerful magic can bind an 
elemental spirit into a material template that defines 
a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air 
elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way 
that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds. 
The strength of the magic and materials that bind an 
elemental determines how well the elemental functions 
in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to 
physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and 
clay can't bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable 
materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, 
which consequently binds an elemental more securely. 
Elemental Nature. An elemental doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep. 
AIR ELEMENTAL 
An air elemental is a funneling cloud of whirling air with 
a vague semblance of a face. Although it likes to race 
across the ground, picking up dust and debris as it goes, 
it can also fly and attack from above. 
An air elemental can turn itself into a screaming 
cyclone, creating a whirlwind that batters creatures 
even as it flings them away. 
EARTH ELEMENTAL 
An earth elemental plods forward like a walking hill, 
club-like arms of jagged stone swinging at its sides. Its 
head and body consist of dirt and stone, occasionally set 
with chunks of metal, gems, and bright minerals. 
Earth elementals glide through rock and earth 
as though they were liquid. Earthbound creatures 
have much to fear from an earth elemental, since the 
elemental can pinpoint the precise location of any foe 
that stands on solid ground in its vicinity. 
FIRE ELEMENTAL 
A faint humanoid shape threads through the core of 
this wild, moving flame. A fire elemental is a force of 
capricious devastation. Wherever it moves, it sets. its 
surroundings ablaze, turning the world to ash, smoke, 
and cinders. Water can halt its destructive progress, 
causing the fire elemental to shrink back, hissing and 
smoking in pain and rage. 
WATER ELEMENTAL 
A water elemental is a cresting wave that rolls across 
the ground, becoming nearly invisible at it courses 
through a larger body of water. It engulfs creatures that 
stand against it, filling their mouths and lungs as easily 
as it smothers flame.
