Elemental Demise. If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into 
a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was 
wearing or carrying. 
Innate Spellcasting. The djinni's innate spellcasting ability 
is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It 
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material 
components: 
At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, thunderwave 
VARIANT: GENIE POWERS 
Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. 
A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their 
appearance or the nature of reality. 
Disguises. Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to 
pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can 
innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer 
duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can 
cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, 
possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can 
change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell 
1 
on other creatures and objects as well. 
Wishes. The genie power to grant wishes is legendary 
among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those 
among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this 
power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't 
a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't 
grant wishes again for some amount oftime (usually 1 year). 
and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend 
its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that 
creature's existence. 
To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie 
states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the 
wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. 
Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to 
pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor 
wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to 
be to the genie's benefit.

3Jday each: create food and water (can create wine instead of 
water), tongues, wind walk 
1Jday each: conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation, 
gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The djinni makes three scimitar attacks. 
Scimitar. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning 
or thunder damage (djinni's choice). 
Create Whirlwind. A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of 
swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see 
within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni 
maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any 
creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed 
on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The 
djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, 
and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The 
whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it. 
A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained 
by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 
18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no 
longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the 
whirlwind.
