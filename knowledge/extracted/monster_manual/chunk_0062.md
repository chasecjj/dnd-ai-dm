DRACOLICH 
Even as long-lived as they are, all dragons must 
eventually die. This thought doesn't sit well with 
many dragons, some of which allow themselves to 
be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient 
rituals into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the 
most narcissistic dragons choose this path, knowing 
that by doing so, they sever all ties to their kin and the 
dragon gods. 
Beyond Death. A dracolich retains its shape and 
size upon transforming, its skin and scales drawing 
tight to its bones or sloughing away to leave a skeletal 
form behind. Its eyes appear as glowing points of light 
floating in shadowy sockets, hinting at the malevolence 
of its undead mind. 
Though many dragons pursue vain goals of 
destruction and dominance, dracoliches are more 
nefarious than the most evil dragons, driven to rule 
over all. A dracolich is a fiendishly intelligent tyrant that 
crafts complex webs of foul schemes, attracting servants 
motivated by greed and a lust for power. Acting from 
the shadows and actively plotting to keep its existence a 
secret, a dracolich is a cunning and challenging foe. 
Draco/ich Phylacteries. Creating a dracolich requires 
the cooperation of the dragon and a group of mages or 
cultists that can perform the proper ritual. During the 
ritual, the dragon consumes a toxic brew that slays it 
instantly. The attendant spellcasters then ensnare its 
spirit and transfer it to a special gemstone that functions 
like a lich's phylactery. As the dragon's flesh rots 
away, the spirit inside the gem returns to animate the 
dragon's bones. 
If a dracolich's physical form is ever destroyed, its 
spirit returns to the gem as long as the two are on 
the same plane. If the gem comes into contact with 
another dragon's corpse, the dracolich's spirit can take 
possession of that corpse to become a new dracolich. If 
the dracolich's spirit gem is taken to another plane, the 
dracolich's spirit has nowhere to go when its undead 
body is destroyed and simply passes into the afterlife. 
DRACOLICH TEMPLATE 
Only an ancient or adult true dragon can be transformed 
into a dracolich. Younger dragons that attempt to 
undergo the transformation die, as do other creatures 
that aren't true dragons but possess the dragon type, 
such as pseudodragons and wyverns. A shadow dragon 
can't be transformed into a dracolich, for it has already 
lost too much of its physical form. 
When a dragon becomes a dracolich, it retains its 
statistics except as described below. The dragon loses 
any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living 
physiology. The dracolich might retain or lose any or all 
of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit. 
Type. The dracolich's type changes from dragon 
to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
Damage Resistance. The dracolich has resistance to 
necrotic damage. 
Damage Immunities. The dracolich has immunity 
to poison. It also retains any immunities it had prior to 
becoming a dracolich. 
Condition Immunities. The dracolich can't be 
charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. It also 
doesn't suffer from exhaustion. 
Magic Resistance. The dracolich has advantage on 
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
