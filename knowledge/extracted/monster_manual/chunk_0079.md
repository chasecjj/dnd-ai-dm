BRASS DRAGON 
The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons 
crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates. 
A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad 
'·protective plate that expands from its forehead and the 
spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of 
its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length 
of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, 
mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to 
shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. 
Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, 
darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its 
pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs. 
Boldly Talkative. A brass dragon engages in 
conversations with thousands of creatures throughout 
its long life, accumulating useful information which it 
will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent 
creature tries to leave a·brass dragon's presence without 
engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the 
creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the 
dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep 
gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the 
creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws 
or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's 
thirst for small talk is slaked. 
A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear 
to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart 
enough to know when it is being manipulated. When

Prized Treasures. Brass dragons covet magic 
items that allow them to converse with interesting 
personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or a 
magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the 
greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess. 
Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds 
of sand or in secret places far from their primary 
lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their 
treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. 
Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they 
happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure 
cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these 
might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard. 
A BRAss DRAGON's LAIR 
A brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, 
or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: 
• A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature 
within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 
Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from 
the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are 
dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are 
extinguished. Protected flames; such as lanterns, have 
a 50 percent chance of being extinguished. 
A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere 
centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 
feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each 
creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair 
is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or 
more of the following effects: 
• Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the drag-
on's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden 
water sources, while also leading away from areas 
that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed. 
• Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the des-
ert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These 
illusions move and appear real, although they can do 
no harm. A creature that examines an image from a 
distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 
20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical 
interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, 
because objects pass through it. 
• Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or 
higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 
mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of 
the creature's presence and location. 
If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the 
other effects fade immediately.
