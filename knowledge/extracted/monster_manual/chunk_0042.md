Figures of ancient and terrible evil, balors rule as 
generals over demonic armies, yearning to seize power 
while destroying any creatures that oppose them. 
Wielding a flaming whip and a longsword that 
channels the power of the storm, a balor's battle 
prowess is fueled by hatred and rage. It channels this 
demonic fury in its death throes, falling within a blast of 
fire that can destroy even the hardiest foes. 
BARLGURA 
The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality 
of t'he Abyss. Barlguras gather in packs to take down 
tougher foes, keep gruesome trophies from their 
victories, and decorate their territory with such objects. 
,A barlgura looks like a hulking orangutan with a 
gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from 
its jaw. Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad 
shoulders and weighs 650 pounds. It moves apishly 
along the ground, but it climbs with great speed 
and agility. 
CHASME 
This loathsome demon resembles an unspeakable 
crossing of humanoid and fly. A chasme shuffles about 
on four spindly legs that can find purchase on walls 
and ceilings. A droning sound precedes the approach 
of a chasme, inflicting foes with a terrible lethargy that 
leaves them open to attack. 
The lowly chasmes serve more powerful masters as 
interrogators or taskmasters. A chasme lives to dole 
out torture as punishment, and has a knack for spotting 
demons that have deserted their lords. Capturing and 
returning such traitors allows a chasme to torment the 
victim without fear of reprisal. 
DRETCH 
Dretches are among the weakest of demons- repulsive, 
self-loathing creatures doomed to spend eternity in a 
state of perpetual discontent. Their low intelligence 
makes dretches unsuitable for anything but the simplest 
tasks. However, what they lack in potential, they make 
up for in sheer malice. Dretches mill about in mobs, 
voicing their displeasure as an unsettling din of hoots, 
snarls, and grunts. 
GLABREZU 
A glabrezu takes great pleasure in destroying mortals 
through temptation, and these creatures are among the 
few demons to offer their service to creatures foolish 
enough to summon them. 
Although glabrezus are devastating in combat, they 
prefer to tempt victims into ruin, using power or wealth 
as a lure. Engaging in guile, trickery, and evil bargains, 
a glabrezu hoards riches that it uses to fulfill promises 
to shortsighted summoners and weak-willed mortals. 
However,. if its attempts to entice or deceive fail, a 
glabrezu has the strength to fight and win. 
GORISTRO 
The goristro resembles a fiendish minotaur t0wering1 
more than twenty feet tall. When controlled by a demon 
lord, goristros make formidable living siege engines and 
prized pets. Goristros possess preternatural cunning 
when navigating labyrinthine passages and shifting 
corridors, pursuing foes in a terrifying hunt. 
A hulking goristro sometimes bears a palanquin,. 
carrying smaller demons on its broad shoulders, m~ch 
like an elephant carries riders on its back: 
r 
HEZROU 
Hezrous serve as foot soldiers in the demoniG h~f1des of 
the Abyss. Although physically powerful, they are weak-
minded and hezrous can easily be duped into sacrificing 
themselves by more powerful demons. As they press 
their attacks into the heart of an enemy's forces, their 
foul stench can sicken even the toughest foes. 
MANES 
Souls of evil creatures that descend to the Lower 
Planes are transformed into manes-the lowest form 
of demonkind. These wretched fiends attack any non-
demon they see, and they are called to the Material 
Plane by those seeking to sow death and chaos. 
Orcus, the Prince of Undeath, has the power to 
transform manes into undead monsters, most often 
ghouls and shadows. Other demon lords feed on manes, 
destroying them utterly. Otherwise, killing a manes 
causes it to dissipate into a cloud of reeking vapor that 
reforms into another manes after one day. 
MARILITH 
Terrible to behold, a marilith has the lower body of a 
great serpent and the upper torso of a humanoid female 
with six arms. 
Wielding a wicked blade in each of its six hands, a 
marilith is a devastating foe that few can match in battle. 
These demons possess keen minds and a finely honed 
sense of tactics, and they are able to lead and unite 
other demons in common cause. Mariliths are often 
encountered as captains at the head of a demonic horde, 
where they embrace any opportunity to rush headlong 
into battle. 
DEMON TRUE NAMES 
Though demons all have common names, every demon lord 
and every demon of type 1 through 6 has a true name that 
it keeps secret. A demon can be forced to disclose its true 
name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to 
exist that list the true names of the most powerful demons. 
A mortal who learns a demon's true name can use 
powerful summoning magic to call the demon from the 
Abyss and exercise some measure of control over it. 
However, most demons brought to the Material Plane in this 
, manner do everything in their power to wreak havoc or sow 
discord and strife.
