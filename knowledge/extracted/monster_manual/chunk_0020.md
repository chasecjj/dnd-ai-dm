BE'HOLDERS 
•J 
One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul 
a'nd otherworldly nature. Aggressive, hateful, and 
greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as 
lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as 
they choose. 
A beholder's spheroid body levitates at all times, and 
its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while 
the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn 
to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes 
its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert. 
Xenophobic Isolationists. Enemies abound, or 
so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced 
that other creatures resent them for their brilliance 
and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser 
creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always 
suspect others of plotting against them, even when no 
other creatures are around. 
The disdain a beholder has for other creatures 
extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its 
form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that 
form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders 
vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict 
between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected 
by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth 
hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, 
while others' stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even 
slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two 
beholders into lifelong enemies. 
Eye Tyrant. Some beholders manage to channel 
their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. 
Rather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants 
enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling 
vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a 
domain within or under a major city, commanding 
networks of agents that operate on their master's behalf. 
Alien Lairs. Because they refuse to share territory 
with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, 
abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A 
beholder's lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, 
emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers 
stacked on top of each other. Such an environment 
allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents 
intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders 
do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a 
beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor. 
As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder's lair 
reflect the creature's arrogance. It festoons its chambers 
with trophies from the battles it has won, including 
petrified adventurers standing frozen in their horrified 
final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic 
items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges 
its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly 
parts with its treasures. 
A BEHOLDER's LAIR 
A beholder's central lair is typically a large, spacious 
cavern with high ceilings, where it can attack without 
fear of closing to melee range. A beholder encountered 
in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).

When fighting inside it~ lair, a beholder can invoke the 
ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 
20 (losing initiative ties), the beholder can take one lair 
action to cause one of the following effects: 
• A 50-foot square area of ground within 120 feet of the 
beholder becomes slimy; that area is difficult terrain 
until initiative count 20 on the next round. 
• Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping 
appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after 
next. Each creature of the beholder's choice that starts 
its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed 
on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. 
Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength 
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
• An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the 
beholder. One random eye ray of the beholder shoots 
from that eye at a target of the beholder's choice that it 
can see. The eye then closes and disappears. 
The beholder can't repeat an effect until they have 
all been used, and it can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
·A region containing a beholder's lair is warped by the 
creature's'unnatural presence, which creates one or 
more of the following effects: 
• Creatures within 1 mile of the beholder's lair some-
times feel as if they're being watched when they aren't. 
• When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality 
occur within 1 mi1e of its lair and then vanish 24 
hours later. Marks on cave walls might change subtly, 
an eerie trinket might appear where none existed 
before, harmless slime might coat a statue, and so 
on. These effects apply only to natural surfaces and to 
nonmagical objects that aren't on anyone's person. 
If the beholder dies, these effects fade over the course 
of 1d10 days. 
DEATH TYRANT 
On rare occasions, a beholder's sleeping mind drifts to 
places beyond its normal madness, imagining a reality 
in which it exists beyond death. When such dreams take 
hold, a beholder can transform, its flesh sloughing away 
to leave a death tyrant behind. This monster possesses 
the cunning and much of the magic it had in life, but it is 
fueled by the power of undeath. 
A death tyrant appears as a massive, naked skull, with 
a pinpoint of red light gleaming in its hollow eye socket. 
With its eyestalks rotted away, ten spectral eyes hover 
above the creature and glare in all directions. 
Deathly Despot. As they did when they were 
beholders, death tyrants lord their power over other 
creatures. Moreover, a beholder's ability to quash 
magical energy with its central eye gives way to a more 
sinister power in a death tyrant, which can transform 
former slaves and enemies into undead servants. 
Zombies created by a death tyrant are used and 
discarded as needed. They stand guard at the entrances 
to the death tyrant's lair or guard its treasure vaults. 
Acting as bait for traps or as combat fodder, Z0mbies 
keep powerful enemies distracted while the death tyrant ,, , 
moves into position and prepares to destroy them. 
Armies of the Dead. A death tyrant that embraces 
undeath becomes an engine of destruction. Driven by 
a hunger for power and security, it advances against 
humanoid settlements, using its eye rays to destroy 
every creature it encounters, then building an army of 
undead. If left unchecked, a death tyrant might wipe out 
the population of a city in weeks, then set its unde~d eye 
on wider conquest. As each settlement falls, the death 
tyrant's zombie forces build to overwhelming numpers. 
Undead Nature. A death tyrant doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep. 
A DEATH TYRANT's LAIR 
A death tyrant's lair is usually the same site it held as 
a beholder, but it contains more trappings of death 
and decay. A death tyrant encountered in its lair has a 
challenge rating of 15 (13,000 XP). 
LAIR ACTIONS 
When fighting inside its lair, a death tyrant can invoke 
the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative 
count 20 (losing initiative ties), the death tyrant can take 
one lair action to cause one of the following effects: 
An area that is a 50-foot cube within 120 feet of the 
tyrant is filled with spectral eyes and tentacles. To 
creatures other than the death tyrant, that area is 
lightly obscured and difficult terrain until initiative 
count 20 on the next round. 
• Walls sprout spectral appendages until initiative 
count 20 on the round after next. Any creature, includ-
ing one on the Ethereal Plane, that is hostile to the 
tyrant and starts its turn within 10 feet of a wall must 
succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grap-
pled. Escaping requires a successful DC 17 Strength 
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
• A spectral eye opens in the air at a point within 50 feet 
of the tyrant. One random eye ray of the tyrant shoots 
from that eye, which is considered to be an ethereal 
source, at a target of the tyrant's choice. The eye then 
closes and disappears. 
The death tyrant can't repeat an effect until all three 
have been used, and it can't use the same effect on 
consecutive rounds. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
A region containing a death tyrant's lair is warped by 
the creature's unnatural presence, which creates one or 
more of the following effects: 
Creatures within 1 mile of the tyrant's lair sometimes 
feel as if they're being watched even when they aren't. 
When a creature hostile to the tyrant and aware of 
its existence finishes a long rest within 1 mile of the 
tyrant's lair, roll a d20 for that creature. On a roll of 10 
or lower, the creature is subjected to one random eye 
· ray of the tyrant. 
If the death tyrant dies, these effects fade over the 
course of 1d10 days.
