Consume Life. As a bonus action, the will-o'-wisp can target 
one creature it can see within 5 feet of it that has 0 hit 
points and is still alive. The target must succeed on a DC 10 
Constitution saving throw against this magic or die. If the 
target dies, the will-o'-wisp regains 10 (3d6) hit points. 
Ephemeral. The will-o'-wisp can't wear or carry anything. 
Incorporeal Movement. The will-o'-wisp can move through 
other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It 
takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 
Variable Illumination. The will-o'-wisp sheds bright light in a 5-
to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number offeet 
equal to the chosen radius. The will-o'-wisp can alter the radius 
as a bonus action. 
ACTIONS 
Shock. Melee Spell Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
Hit: 9 (2d8) lightning damage. 
Invisibility. The will-o'-wisp and its light magically become 
invisible until it attacks or uses its Life Drain, or until its 
concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). 
WILL-o'-WISP 
Will-o'-wisps are malevolent, wispy balls of light that 
haunt lonely places and battlefields, bound by dark fate 
or dark magic to feed on fear and despair. 
Hope and Doom. Will-o'-wisps look like bobbing 
lantern lights in the distance, although they can choose 
to alter their colors, or wink out completely. When they 
activate their lights, will-o'-wisps offer hope, hinting of 
safety to creatures that follow them. 
Will-o'-wisps lure unwary creatures into quicksand 
pits, monster lairs, and other dangerous places so 
that they can feed on the suffering of their prey and 
revel in their death screams. An evil being that falls 
prey to a will-o'-wisp might become a wisp itself, its 
woeful spirit coalescing above its lifeless corpse like a 
flickering flame. 
Consumed by Despair. Will-o'-wisps are the souls of 
evil beings that perished in anguish or misery as they 
wandered forsaken lands permeated with powerful 
magic. They thrive in swampy bogs and bone-strewn 
battlefields where the oppressive weight of sorrow 
stoops even heavier than the low-hanging mist and 
fog. Trapped in these desolate places of lost hope and 
memory, will-o'-wisps lure other creatures toward 
dismal fates and feed on their misery. 
Agents of Evil. Will-o'-wisps rarely speak, but when 
they do, their voices sound like faint or distant whispers. 
In the miserable domains they haunt, will-o'-wisps 
sometimes form symbiotic relationships with their 
wicked neighbors. Hags, oni, black dragons, and evil 
cultists work with will-o'-wisps to draw creatures into 
ambush. As their evil allies surround and slaughter 
creatures, the wisps hover above them, drinking the 
agony of a last breath and savoring the sensation as the 
light of life goes out in a creature's eyes. 
Undead Nature. A will-o'-wisp doesn't require air, 
drink, or sleep.
