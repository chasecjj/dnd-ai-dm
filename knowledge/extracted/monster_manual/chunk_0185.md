PEGASUS 
PEGASUS 
The white winged horses known as pegasi soar 
through the skies, a vision of grace and majesty. When 
they touch down on solid ground, they linger only 
for a moment, drinking from mountain springs and 
pristine lakes. Any sound or sign of another creature 
startles them, sending them off to fly once more 
among the clouds. 
Noble Mounts. Pegasi are highly prized as swift and 
reliable steeds, being faster and less temperamental 
than griffons, hippogriffs, and wyverns. However, these 
wild and shy creatures are as intelligent as humanoids, 
and so can't be traditionally broken and tamed. A 
pegasus must be persuaded to serve a good-aligned 
creature as a mount, but when it does so, it forges a life-
long bond with its new companion. 
Born of the Planes. Pegasi trace their origins to the 
Olympian Glades of Arborea, where they soar through 
the skies of that plane and serve as faithful mounts to 
the Seldarine, the pantheon of elven gods. These gods 
have been known to send pegasi to the Material Plane to 
aid those in need. 
Pegasi Nests. Pegasi mate for life, build their nests in 
hard-to-reach locations, and give birth to live young.

PERYTON 
Although this monstrous carnivore feeds on 
any creature, it prefers humanoids, especially 
elves, half-elves, and humans. When it kills a 
humanoid, a peryton rips out its prey's heart and 
takes it back to its nest to be devoured. 
The peryton is a bizarre creature that blends the 
body and wings of a bird of prey with the head of a 
stag. Its strangest feature is its shadow, which appears 
humanoid rather than reflecting the creature's physical 
form. Sages postulate that the first perytons were 
humans transformed by a hideous curse or magical 
experiment, but bards tell a different tale of a man 
whose infidelity caused his scorned wife to cut out the 
heart of her younger, more beautiful rival and consume 
it in a ritual intended to forever win her husband's 
heart. The ritual succeeded until the woman's villainy 
was exposed. She was hanged for her crime, but the 
lingering magic of her foul ritual caused the carrion 
birds that feasted on her corpse to transform into the 
first perytons. 
Unnatural Hunger. A peryton's reproductive cycle 
depends on the heart of a freshly killed humanoid. The 
organ must be consumed by a female peryton before 
she can reproduce. When a peryton consumes a heart, 
its shadow changes for a brief time to reflect its true 
monstrous form. 
When attacking a humanoid, a peryton is single-
minded and relentless, fighting until it or its prey dies. 
If a peryton is somehow driven away, it stalks lost prey 
from afar, attacking again when the opportunity arises. 
Bane of the Mountains. Perytons roost atop 
mountain ridges and lair in high caves. They prey on 
creatures living or wandering in the vales below, and 
travelers on lonely mountain roads learn to keep a 
wary eye on the sky. Because normal weapons are less 
effective against perytons, the folk of the mountains 
know to avoid confrontations with these monsters 
at all costs. 
Established settlements are attractive to perytons 
as a renewable food source. As such, village councils 
and local nobles' often hire adventurers to eliminate 
peryton nests. .

straight toward a target and then hits it with a melee weapon

it flies out of an enemy's reach.
