LICH 
Liches are the remains of great wizards who embrace 
undeath as a means of preserving themselves. They 
further their own power at any cost, having no interest 
in the affairs of the living except where those affairs 
interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they 
hunger for long-forgotten knowledge and the most 
terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't 
hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, 
decades, or centuries to come to fruition. 
A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with 
withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes 
succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn 
in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering 
remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by 
the passage of time. 
Secrets ofUndeath. No wizard takes up the path to 
lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich 
is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom 
must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul 
entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, 
whose power has created countless liches. However, 
those that control the power of lichdom always demand 
fealty and service for their knowledge. 
A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the 
wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the 
soul to the mortal world, preventing it from traveling 
to the Outer Planes after death. A phylactery is 
traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but 
it can take the form of any item possessing an interior 
space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, 
immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver. 
With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a 
potion of transformation-a vile concoction of poison 
mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose 
soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls 
dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the 
phylactery, where it forever remains. 
Soul Sacrifices. A lich must periodically feed souls to 
its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body 
and consciousness. It does this using the imprisonment 
spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options 
of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap 
the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The 
phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for 
the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only 
one creature at a time, and a dispel magic cast as a 
9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature 
imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the 
phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed 
utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention 
can restore it to life. 
A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with 
sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and 
might eventually become a demilich. 
Death and Restoration. When a lich's body is 
broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of 
the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse 
behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the 
lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that 
issues from the device. Because the destruction of 
its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, 
a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-
guarded location. 
Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and 
often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every 
phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its 
destruction can be a quest in and of itself. 
Lonely Existence. From time to time, a lich might be ! 
stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to .take 
an interest in the world around it, most often when some 
great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise 
lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures 
~ ,. 
whose service helps secure its lair. 
Few liches call themselves by their former names, 
instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or 
the Forgotten King. 
Magic Collectors. Liches collect spells and magic 
items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready 
access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spell books, one 
or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no 
qualms about putting these treasures to use whenever 
its lair comes under attack. 
Undead Nature. A lich doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
A LicH's LAIR 
A lich often haunts the abode it favored in life, such as 
a lonely tower, a haunted ruin, or an academy of black 
magic. Alternatively, some liches construct secret tombs 
filled with powerful guardians and traps. 
Everything about a lich's lair reflects its keen mind 
and wicked cunning, including the magic and mundane 
traps that secure it. Undead, constructs, and bound 
demons lurk in shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy 
those who dare to disturb the lich's work. 
A lich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 
22 (41,000 XP). 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lich 
can take a lair action to cause one of the following 
magical effects; the lich can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row: 
• The lich rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level 
or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or 
lower, nothing happens. 
• The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet 
of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the 
lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, 
the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage 
(rounded down), and the target takes the remaining 
damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on 
the next round or until the lich or the target is no lon-
ger in the lich's lair. 
• The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in 
its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one 
creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The 
target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving 
throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a success. The appa-
ritions then disappear.
