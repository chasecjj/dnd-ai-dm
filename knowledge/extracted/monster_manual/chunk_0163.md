MAGMA MEPHIT 
Composed of earth and fire, 
magma mephits glow a dull 
red color as they perspire beads 
of molten lava. They are slow to 
comprehend the meaning of others' 
words and actions. 
Mun MEPHIT 
Mud mephits are slow, unctuous creatures of earth 
and water. They drone their complaints to all who will 
listen, and beg incessantly for attention and treasure.

SMOKE MEPHIT 
Smoke mephits are crude, lazy creatures of air 
and fire that billow smoke constantly. They 
rarely speak the truth and love to mock and 
mislead other creatures. 
STEAM MEPHIT 
Composed of fire and water, steam 
mephits leave trails of hot water 
wherever they go, and they hiss 
with tendrils of steam. Bossy and 
hypersensitive, they are the self-
appointed overlords of all mephits. 
VARIANT: MEPHIT SUMMONING 
Some mephits can have an action option that allows them to 
summon other mephits. 
Summon Mephits (1JDay). The mephit has a 25 percent 
chance of summoning 1d4 mephits of its kind. A summoned 
mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of 
its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't 
summon other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it 
or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it 
as an action.
