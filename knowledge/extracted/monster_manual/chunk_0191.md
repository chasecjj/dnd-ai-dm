From !;Jeneath the snow and ice bursts a remorhaz in 
a cloud of steam, its body pulsing with internal fire. 
Winglike fins flare from the back of the creature's head, 
and its wide mouth brims with jagged teeth. 
Arctic Predators. Remorhazes live in arctic climes, 
preying on elk, polar bears, and other creatures sharing 
their territory. They can't tolerate warm weather, having 
adapted to the cold by generating a furnace-like heat 
within their bodies. When hunting, a remorhaz burrows 
deep below the snow and ice and lies in wait for the faint 
vibrations created by a creature moving above it. While 
hidden under the ice and snow, it can lower its body 
temperature so that it doesn't melt its cover. 
Young Ones. Frost giant hunters scour the icy wastes 
for remorhaz nests and eggs. The giants prize young 
remorhazes, which can be trained from hatching to obey 
commands and guard the giants' icy citadels. Unlike 
fully grown specimens, young remorhazes gnaw on 
their victims instead of swallowing them whole.

Heated Body. A creature that touches the remorhaz or hits 
it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) 
fire damage. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 11 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 40 (6d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage. 
If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until 
this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the remorhaz 
can't bite another target. 
Swallow. The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a 
Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, 
that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and 
the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and 
restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects 
outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the 
start of each of the remorhaz's turns. 
If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn 
from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end ofthat turn or 
regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a 
space within 10 feet oft he remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a 
swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape 
from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
