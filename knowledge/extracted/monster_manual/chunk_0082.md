BRONZE DRAGON 
Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily 
on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of 
friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. 
They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join 
armies fighting for a just cause. 
A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze 
dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, 
echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them 
swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth 
scales. A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged 
with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood 
does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The 
pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, 
until they resemble glowing green orbs. 
Dragons of the Coast. Bronze dragons love to 
watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near 
their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or 
seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more 
closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a 
ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold 
for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its 
hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item. 
War Machines. Bronze dragons actively oppose 
tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their 
mettle by putting their size and strength to good use. 
When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon 
ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services 
to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon 
commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally. 
Well-Organized Wealth. Bronze dragons loot sunken 
ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from 
the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze 
dragon pledges to help an army wage war against 
tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request 
is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection 
of old books on military history or a ceremonial item 
commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might 
also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it 
feels would be safer under its protection. 
A BRONZE DRAGON'S LAI R 
A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage 
a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its 
lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: 
• The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the fog 
cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on 
the next round. 
A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see 
within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot 
radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder 
damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lair 
is warped by the dragon's magic.

Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6). The dragon uses one of the 
following breath weapons. 
Lightning Breath. The dragon exhales lightning in a 40-foot line 
that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 
12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage 
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Repulsion Breath. The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a 
30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a 
DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is 
pushed 30 feet away from the dragon. 
Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 
6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't 
need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to 
the control weather spell. 
Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair 
take on dazzlingly brilliant hues. 
• Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, 
such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they 
can be heard in various parts of the lair. 
If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, 
as described in the spell, and the other effects fade 
in 1dl0 days.
