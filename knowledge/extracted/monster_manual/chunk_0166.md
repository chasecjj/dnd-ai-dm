MINOTAUR 
A minotaur's roar is a savage battle cry that most 
civilized creatures fear. Born into the mortal realm by 
demonic rites, minotaurs are savage conquerors and 
carnivores that live for the hunt. Their brown or black 
fur is stained with the blood of fallen foes, and they 
carry the stench of death. 
The Beast Within. Most minotaurs are solitary 
carnivores that roam labyrinthine dungeons, twisting 
caves, primeval woods, and the maze-like streets and 
passages of desolate ruins. A minotaur can visualize 
every route it might take to close the distance to its prey. 
The scent of blood, the tearing of flesh, and the 
cracking of bones spur a minotaur's lust for carnage, 
overwhelming all thought and reason. In a blood rage, 
a minotaur charges anything it sees, butting and goring 
like a battering ram, then chopping the fallen in twain. 
Apart from ambushing creatures that wander into its 
labyrinth, a minotaur cares little for strategy or tactics. 
Minotaurs seldom organize, they don't respect authority 
or hierarchy, and they are notoriously difficult to enslave, 
let alone control. 
Cults of the Horned King. Minotaurs are the dark 
descendants of humanoids transformed by the rituals of 
cults that reject the oppression of authority by returning 
to nature. Inductees often mistake these cults for 
druidic circles or totemic religions whose ceremonies 
involve entering a labyrinth while wearing a ceremonial 
animal mask. 
Within these bounded environments, cultists hunt, 
kill, and eat wild beasts, indulging their basest primal 
urges. In the end, however, sacrificial animals are 
exchanged for humanoid sacrifice- sometimes an 
inductee that tried to escape the cult after learning its 
secrets. These labyrinths become blood-soaked halls of 
slaughter, echoing to the cultists' savagery. 
Unknown to all but their highest-ranking leaders, 
these mystery cults are creations of the demon lord 
Baphomet, the Horned King, whose layer of the Abyss 
is a gigantic labyrinth. Some of his followers are fervent 
supplicants that plead for strength and power. Others 
come to the cult seeking a life free from authority's 
chains- and are liberated of their humanity instead as 
Baphomet transforms them into the minotaurs that echo 
his own savage form. 
Although they begin as creations of the Horned King, 
minotaurs can breed true with one another, giving rise 
to an independent race of Baphomet's savage children 
in the world.

it has traveled.
