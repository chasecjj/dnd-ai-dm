DRAGON, SHADOW 
Shadow dragons are true dragons that were either born 
In the Shadowfell or transformed by years spent within 
its dismal confines. Some shadow dragons embrace 
the Shadowfell for its bleak landscapes and desolation. 
Others seek to return to the Material Plane, hungry to 
spread the darkness and evil of the Plane of Shadow. 
Dark Portals. Portals to the Shadowfell manifest 
in forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean 
caverns. The dragons that lair in such places often 
discover these portals and find themselves transported 
to a new realm. Ancient dragons that sleep in their lairs 
for months or years at a time might find themselves 
spirited away, never knowing that a portal has formed 
without their knowledge as they dream. 
Recast in Shadow. The transformation to a shadow 
dragon happens over a period of years, during which 
time a dragon's scales lose their luster and fade to a 
charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its 
eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons 
find ~unlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright 
light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes the 
dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self. 
The magical nature of dragons holds an attraction 
for the Shadowfell, which seems somehow to crave 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +1 2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
/4it: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage. 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. 
Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. 
Frightful Presence. Each creature of the dracolich's choice that 
is within 120 feet of the dracolich and aware of it must succeed 
on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a 
creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, 
the creature is immune to the dracolich's Frightful Presence for 
the next 24 hours. 
Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dracolich exhales 
lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in 
that line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
LEGEN DARY ACTIONS 
The dracolich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from 
the options below. Only one legendary action option can be 
used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. 
The dracolich regains spent legendary actions at the start 
of its turn. 
Detect. The dracolich makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Tail Attack. The dracolich makes a tail attack. 
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dracolich beats its tattered 
wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dracolich must 
succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 
+ 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. After 
beating its wings this way, the dracolich can fly up to half its 
flying speed. 
the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The 
Shadowfell also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, 
such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, 
the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As months and 
years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes 
aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and 
yet can do nothing to prevent it. 
· Back in the World. A shadow dragon is so suffused 
with the power of the Shadowfell that even a return to 
the Material Plane can't undo its transformation. Some 
shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from 
the mortal realm back to the Shadowfell to keep them 
company, at least until they tire of their guests and 
devour them. Others are happy to leave the Shadowfell 
behind forever, understanding that treasure and power 
are easier to come by in the Material Plane. 
SHADOW DRAGON TEMPLATE 
Only a true dragon can transform into a shadow dragon, 
and only if it is born in the Shadowfell or remains there 
for several years. A dracolich can't be turned into a 
shadow dragon, since it loses its draconic nature when it 
becomes undead. 
When a dragon becomes a shadow dragon, it retains 
its statistics except as described below. The shadow
