GNOL,LS 
' /.'· 
Gnolls are feral humanoids that attack settlements 
along the frontiers and borderlands of civilization 
without warning, slaughtering their victims and 
devouring their flesh. 
Demonic Origin. The origin of the gnolls traces back 
to a time when the demon lord Yeenoghu found his way 
to the Material Plane and ran amok. Packs of ordinary 
hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon 
lord's kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first 
gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished 
back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the 
face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power. 
Nomadic Destroyers. Gnolls are dangerous 
because they strike at random. They emerge from 
the wilderness, plunder and slaughter, then move 
elsewhere. They attack like a plague of locusts, 
pillaging settlements and leaving little behind but razed 
buildings, gnawed corpses, and befouled land. Gnolls 
choose easy targets for their raids. Armored warriors 
holed up in a fortified castle will survive a rampaging 
gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and 
farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people 
slaughtered and devoured. 
Gnolls rarely build permanent structures or 
craft anything of lasting value. They don't make 
weapons or armor, but scavenge such items from the 
corpses of their fallen victims, stringing ears, teeth, 
scalps, and other trophies from their foes onto their 
patchwork armor. 
Thirst for Blood. No goodness or compassion 
resides in the heart of a gnoll. Like a demon, it lacks 
anything resembling a conscience, and can't be taught 
or coerced to put aside its destructive tendencies. The 
gnolls' frenzied bloodlust makes them an enemy to all, 
and when they lack a common foe, they fight among 
themselves. Even the most savage orcs avoid allying 
with gnolls. 
GNOLL PACK LORD 
The alpha of a gnoll pack is the pack lord, ruling by 
might and cunning. A pack lord earns the best of a gnoll 
· pack's spoils, food, valuable trinkets, and magic items. It 
ornaments its body with brutal piercings and grotesque 
trophies, dyeing its fur with demonic sigils, hoping 
Yeenoghu will make it invulnerable. 
GNOLL FANG OF YEENOGHU 
Gnolls celebrate their victories by performing demonic 
rituals and making blood offerings to Yeenoghu. 
Sometimes the demon lord rewards his worshipers 
by allowing one of them to be possessed by a demonic 
spirit. Marked as Yeenoghu's favorite, the lucky recipient 
becomes a fang ofYeenoghu, the chosen of the Gnoll 
Lord. In much the same way Yeenoghu created the 
first gnolls, a hyena that feasts on a fang's slain foe 
undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a full-
grown adult gnoll. Depending on the number of hyenas 
in a region, a fang of Yeenoghu can lead to a startling 
increase in the gnoll population. Finding and killing the 
fang is the only way to keep that population in check.
