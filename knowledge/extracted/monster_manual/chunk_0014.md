ANIMATED OBJECTS 
Animated objects are crafted with potent magic to follow 
the commands of their creators. When not commanded, 
they follow the last order they received to the best of 
their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple 
instructions. Some animated objects (including many of 
those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or 
adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons. 
Constructed Nature. An animated object doesn't 
require air, food, drink, or sleep. 
The magic that animates an object is dispelled when 
the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object 
reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too 
damaged to be of much use or value to anyone. 
ANIMATED ARMOR 
This empty steel shell clamors as it moves, heavy 
plates banging and grinding against one another like 
the vengeful spirit of a fallen knight. Ponderous but 
persistent, this magical guardian is almost always a suit 
of plate armor. 
To add to its menace, animated armor is frequently 
enchanted with scripted speech, so the armor can utter 
warnings, demand passwords, or deliver riddles. Rare 
suits of animated armor are able to carry on an actual 
conv'et:sation. 
FLYING SWORD 
A flying sword dances through the air, fighting with the 
confidejlce of a warrior that can't be injured. Swords 
are the most common weapons animated with magic. 
Axes, clubs, daggers, maces, spears, and even self-
loading crossbows are also known to exist in animated 
object form. 
RUG OF SMOTHERING 
Would-be thieves and careless heroes arrive at the 
doorsteps of an enemy's abode, eyes and ears alert for 
traps, only to end their quest prematurely as the rugs 
beneath their feet animate and smother them to death. 
A rug of smothering can be made in many different 
forms, from a finely woven carpet fit for a queen to 
a coarse mat in a peasant's hovel. Creatures with 
the ability to sense magic detect the rug's false 
magical aura. 
In some cases, a rug of smothering is disguised as 
a carpet of flying or another beneficial magic item. 
However, a character who stands or sits on the rug, or 
who attempts to utter a word of command, is quickly 
trapped as the rug of smothering rolls itself tightly 
around its victim.
