NIGHT HAG ITEMS 
A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must 
craft for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go 
to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes 
time and effort. 
Heartstone. This lustrous black gem allows a night hag 
to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch 
of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone 
takes 30 days. 
Soul Bag. When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a 
night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul 
in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold 
only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who 
crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag 
takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used 
to make the bag) .

SEA HAG 
Sea hags live in dismal and polluted underwater lairs, 
surrounded by merrow and other aquatic monsters. 
,.. 
Beauty drives a sea hag to fits of anger. When 
confronted with something beautiful, the hag might 
simply attack it or deface it. If something beautiful gives 
hope, a sea hag wants it to cause despair. If it inspires 
courage, the sea hag wants it to cause fear. 
Ugly Inside and Out. Sea hags are by far the ugliest 
of all hags, with slimy scales covering their pallid skin. 
A sea hag's hair resembles seaweed and covers her 
emaciated body, and her glassy eyes seem as lifeless 
as a doll's. Although a sea hag can hide her true form 
under a veil of illusion, the hag is cursed to forever 
appear ugly. Her illusory form appears haggard at best. 
Covens. A sea hag that is part of a coven (see the "Hag 
Covens" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 4 (1,100 XP).

Horrific Appearance. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 
30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make 
a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is 
frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is 
within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If 
a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, 
the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the 
next 24 hours. 
Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's 
true fo rm is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid 
making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, 
a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls 
against the hag. 
ACT IO NS 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. 
Death Glare. The hag targets one frightened creature she can 
see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must 
succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or 
drop to 0 hit points. 
Illusory Appearance. The hag covers herself and anything she 
is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her 
look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid 
shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it 
or if she dies. 
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical 
inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no 
claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. 
Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect 
the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check to discern that the hag is disguised.
