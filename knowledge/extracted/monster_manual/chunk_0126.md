GNOME, DEEP (SVIRFNEBLIN) 
Deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, live far below the world's 
surface in twisting warrens and sculpted caverns. 
They survive by virtue of their stealth, cleverness, and 
tenacity. Their gray skin allows them to blend in with 
surrounding stonework. They are also surprisingly 
heavy and strong for their size. An average adult weighs 
100 to 120 pounds and stands 3 feet tall. 
A typical svirfneblin enclave contains several hundred 
deep gnomes and is strongly fortified. S ecret tunnels 
lead to and from the settlement, and the deep gnomes 
use these as evacuation routes when the enclave comes 
under attack. 
Established Gender Roles. Male svirfneblin 
are bald, while females have stringy gray hair. 
Traditionally, females run the enclaves while males 
scour the outskirts in search of enemies and deposits of 
precious gemstones. 
Gemstone Harvesters. Svirfneblin cherish fine 
gemstones, especially rubies, which they harvest from 
mines deep in the Underdark. The hunt for gems often 
brings them into conflict with beholders, drow, kuo-toa, 
duergar, and mind flayers. Of all their natural enemies, 
deep gnomes fear and despise the murderous, demon-
worshiping drow the most. 
Earth Friends. Deep gnomes are often encountered 
·n the company of creatures from the Elemental Plane 
f Earth. Some svirfneblin can summon such creatures. 
, Earth creatures guard svirfneblin settlements, 
especially xorn enticed to service with the promise of 
gems to feed on.

GOBLINS 
Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that 
lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, 
and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins 
gather in large- sometimes overwhelming- numbers. 
They crave power and regularly abuse whatever 
authority they obtain. 
Goblinoids. Goblins belong to a family of creatures 
called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and 
bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins 
are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, 
laborers, and guards. 
Malicious Glee. Motivated by greed and malice, 
goblins can't help but celebrate the few times they have 
the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when 
victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins 
delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace 
all manner of wickedness. 
Leaders and Followers. Goblins are ruled by the 
strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might 
command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen 
(who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) 
rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple 
lairs to ensure the tribe's survival. Goblin bosses are 
easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by 
hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs. 
Challenging Lairs. Goblins festoon their lairs with 
alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those 
lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes 
that human-sized creatures can't navigate, but which 
goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to 
flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies. 
Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders. Goblins have an 
affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as 
companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins 
shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. 
Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their 
numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, 
goblins use hit-and-run attacks. 
Worshipers ofMaglubiyet. Maglubiyet the Mighty 
One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater 
god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an 
eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and 
fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of 
adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in 
battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army 
on the plane of Acheron. This is a "privilege" that most 
goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny 
even more than death.
