FLU MPH 
The mysterious flumphs drift through the Underdark, 
propelled through the air by the jets whose sound gives 
them their name. A flumph glows faintly, reflecting 
its moods in its color. Soft pink means it is amused, 
deep blue is sadness, green expresses curiosity, and 
crimson is anger. 
lnteJJigent and Wise. Flumphs communicate 
telepathically. Though they resemble jellyfish, flumphs 
are sentient beings of great intelligence and wisdom, 
possessing advanced knowledge of religion, philosophy, 
mathematics, and countless other subjects. 
Flumphs are sensitive to the emotional states of 
nearby creatures. If a creature's thoughts suggest 
goodness, a flumph seeks that creature out. When 
facing creatures that exude evil, a flumph flees. 
Psionic Siphons. Flumphs feed by siphoning mental 
energy from psionic creatures, and they can be found 
lurking near communities of mind flayers, aboleths, 
githyanki, and githzerai. As passive parasites, they take 
only the mental energy they need, and most creatures 
feel no loss or discomfort from such feeding. 
Consuming psionic energy reveals the thoughts and 
emotions of the creatures on which the flumphs feed. 
Since so many of those creatures are evil, flumphs are 
often subjected to thoughts, emotions, and hungers that 
sicken their pure nature. When flumphs encounter good-
hearted adventurers, they eagerly share the dark secrets 
they have learned in the hopes of casting down their 
evil sources of energy, even if doing so rn.eans they must 
seek out new sources of nourishment. 
Flumph Society. Flumphs live in complex and 
organized groups called cloisters, within which each 
flumph has a place and purpose. These harmonious 
groupings have no need for leaders, since all flumphs 
contribute in their own way.

make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, righting itself and ending 
the incapacitated condition if it succeeds.

a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 2 (1d4) acid damage 
on a failure or ending the recurring acid damage on a success. 
A lesser restoration spell cast on the target also ends the 
recurring acid damage. 
Stench Spray (1jDay). Each creature in a 15-foot cone 
originating from the flumph must succeed on a DC 10

A coated creature exudes a horrible stench for 1d4 hours. The 
coated creature is poisoned as long as the stench lasts, and 
other creatures are poisoned while within 5 feet of the coated 
creature. A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a 
short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar.
