DEMILICH 
The immortality granted to a lich lasts only as long as 
it feeds mortal souls to its phylactery. If it falters or fails 
in that task, its bones turn to dust until only its skull 
remains. This "demilich" contains only a fragment of 
the lich's malevolent life force- just enough so that if it 
is disturbed, these remains rise into the air and assume 
a wraithlike form. The skull then emits a terrifying 
howl that can slay the weak-hearted and leave others 
trembling with fear. Left alone, it sinks back down and 
returns to the empty peace of its existence. 
Few liches seek to become demiliches, for it means an 
end to the existence they hoped to preserve by becoming 
undead. However, time can erode the lich's reason and 
memory, causing it to retreat into its ancient tomb and 
forget to feed on souls. The spells it once knew fade 
from its mind, and it no longer channels the arcane 
energy it wielded as a lich. However, even as a mere 
skull it remains a deadly and vexing enemy. 
Enduring Existence. Even after a lich is reduced to 
a demilich state, its phylactery survives. As long as its 
phylactery is intact, the demilich can't be permanently 
destroyed. Its skull reforms after 1d10 days, restoring 
the creature to its wretched state. If it has the presence 
of mind to do so, a demilich can reclaim its former 
power by feeding just one soul to its phylactery. Doing 
so restores the demilich to lich form, reconstituting its 
undead body. 
Undead Nature. A demilich doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep. So great is a demilich's will to survive 
that it always has the maximum number of hit points for 
its Hit Dice, instead of average hit points. 
A DEMILICH's LAIR 
A demilich hides its earthly remains and treasures in a 
labyrinthine tomb guarded by monsters and traps. At the 
heart of this labyrinth rests the demilich's skull and the 
dust from its other bones. 
In its crypt, a demilich has access to lair actions 
and additional uses for its legendary actions. Its whole 
lair also has unique traits. A demilich in its lair has a 
challenge rating of 20 (24,500 XP). 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the demilich 
rolls a d20. On a result of 11 or higher, the demilich 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. It 
can't use the same effect two rounds in a row. 
The tomb trembles violently for a moment. Each crea-
ture on the floor of the tomb must succeed on a DC 19 
Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. 
The demilich targets one creature it can see within 
60 feet of it. An antimagic field fills the space of the 
target, moving with it until initiative count 20 on 
the next round. 
The demilich targets any number of creatures it can 
see within 30 feet of it. No target can regain hit points 
until initiative count 20 on the next round. 
LAIR TRAITS 
A demilich's tomb might have any or all of the following 
effects in place: 
The first time a non-evil creature enters the tomb's 
area, the creature takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage. 
• Monsters in the tomb have advantage on saving 
throws against being charmed or frightened, and 
ag!linst features that turn undead. 
• The tomb is warded against the magical travel of 
creatures the demilich hasn't authorized. Such crea-
tures can't teleport into or out of the tomb's area 
or use planar travel to enter or leave it. Effects that 
allow teleportation or planar travel work within the 
tomb as long as they aren't used to leave or enter the 
tomb's area. 
If the demilich is destroyed, these effects fade over the 
course of 10 days. 
ACERERAK AND HIS DISCIPLES 
The transformation into a demilich isn't a bitter end for 
allliches that experience it. Made as a conscious choice, 
the path of the demilich becomes the next step in a dark 
evolution. The lich Acererak-a powerful wizard and 
demonologist and the infamous master of the Tomb of 
Horrors-anticipated his own transformation, preparing for 
it by setting enchanted gemstones into his skull's eye sockets 
and teeth. Each of these soul gems possessed the power to 
capture the souls on which his phylactery would feed. 
Acererak abandoned his physical body, accepting that it 
would molder and dissolve to dust while he traveled the 
planes as a disembodied consciousness. lfthe skull that 
was his last physical remains was ever disturbed, its gems 
would claim the souls of the insolent intruders to his tomb, 
magically transferring them to his phylactery. 
Liches who follow Acererak's path believe that by becoming 
free of their bodies, they can continue their quest for power 
beyond the mortal world. As their patron did, they secure 
their remains within well-guarded vaults, using soul gems to 
maintain their phylacteries and destroy the adventurers who 
disturb their lairs. 
Acererak or another demilich like him has a challenge 
rating of21 (33,000 XP), or 23 (50,000 XP) in its lair, and 
gains the following additional action option. 
Trap Soul. The demilich targets one creature that it can see 
within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 19 Charisma 
saving throw. On a failed save, the target's soul is magically 
trapped inside one of the demilich's gems. While the soul is 
trapped, the target's body and all the equipment it is carrying 
cease to exist. On a successful save, the target takes 24 
(7d6) necrotic damage, and if this damage reduces the target 
to 0 hit points, its soul is trapped as if it failed the saving 
throw. A soul trapped in a gem for 24 hours is devoured and 
ceases to exist. 
lfthe demilich drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and 
turns to powder, leaving behind its gems. Crushing a gem 
releases any soul trapped within, at which point the target's 
body re-forms in an unoccupied space nearest to the gem 
and in the same state as when it was trapped.
