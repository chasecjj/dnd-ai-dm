THRI- KREEN 
Thfi-kreen wander the deserts and savannas of the 
world, avoiding all other races. 
Thri-Kreen Communication. Thri-kreen employ 
a language without words. To show emotion and 
reaction, a thri-kreen clacks its mandibles and waves its 
antennae, giving other thri-kreen a sense of what it is 
thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this manner 
of communication difficult to interpret and impossible 
to duplicate. 
When forced to interact with creatures of other 
intelligent species, thri-kreen employ alternative 
methods of communication, such as drawing pictures in 
sand or making pictures out of twigs or blades of grass. 
Limited Emotions. Thri-kreen experience the full 
range of emotions but aren't as prone to emotional 
outbursts as humans. Thri-kreen with psionic 
ability often demonstrate a wider range of emotions, 
particularly if they live near or interact with humans or 
other highly emotional creatures. 
Isolationists and Wanderers. Thri-kreen consider 
all other living creatures as potential nourishment, and 
they love the taste of elf flesh in particular. If a creature 
might be useful for something other than food, the thri-
kreen aren't likely to attack it on sight. Thri-kreen kill to 
survive, never for sport. 
Sleepless. Thri-kreen don't require sleep and can rest 
while remaining alert and performing light tasks. Their 
inability to sleep is thought to be the reason why thri-
kreen have such short lifespans, the average thri-kreen 
life expectancy being only thirty years. 
VARIANT: THRI-KREEN WEAPONS AND PSIONICS 
Some thri-kreen employ special martial weapons. A gythka is 
a two-handed polearm with a blade at each end. A chatkcha 
is a flat, triangular wedge with three serrated blades (a light 
thrown weapon). 
A thri-kreen armed with a gythka and chatkchas gains the 
following action options: 
Multiattack. The thri-kreen makes two gythka attacks or 
two chatkcha attacks. 
Gythka. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 5 (1 d8 + 1) slashing damage. 
Chatkcha. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30/120 
ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage. 
A few thri-kreen manifest psionic abilities, using their powers 
to aid the hunt and communicate more easily with outsiders. 
A psionic thri-kreen has telepathy out to a range of 60 feet 
and gains the following additional trait: 
Innate Spellcasting (Psionics). The thri-kreen's innate 
spellcasting ability is Wisdom. The thri-kreen can innately 
cast the following spells, requiring no components: 
At will: mage hand (the hand is invisible) 
2jday each: blur, magic weapon 
1 jday: invisibility (self only)
