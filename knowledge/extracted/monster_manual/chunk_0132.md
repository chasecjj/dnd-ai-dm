Keen Sight. The griffon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks that rely on sight. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The griffon makes two attacks: one with its beak 
and one with its claws. 
Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage. 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. 
Griffons are ferocious avian carnivores with the 
muscular bodies of lions and the head, forelegs, and 
wings of eagles. When they attack, griffons are as swift 
deadly as eagles, even as they strike with a lion's 
might and grace. 
Horse Eaters. Griffons hunt in small prides, flying 
high over plains and forests near their rocky cliff-side 
aeries. Herd animals and horses are the prey they 
crave above all others, though they also hunt and kill 
hippogriffs. When it spots horses, a griffon screeches 
to alert its pride mates, which descend quickly 
toward their prey. 
Those riding or herding horses dread the griffon's 
piercing cry, preparing themselves for the bloody fight 
that inevitably follows. A griffon ignores a horse's rider 
when possible, and a rider that abandons its mount, or 
a herder that releases one or two horses, can escape 
unharmed while the griffon targets its chosen prey. 
Riders who attempt to protect their horses attract the 
full fury of an attacking griffon. 
Sky DweJiers. Griffons lair in high rocky clifftop 
. 
aeries, building their nests from sticks, leaves, and the 
bones of their prey. Once griffons establish a territory, 
they remain in that area until the food supply has 
been exhausted. 
Aggressive and territorial, griffons engage in brutal 
aerial combat to defend their aeries, tearing and 
shredding the wings of flying intruders to send them 
spiraling to the ground. Creatures that climb to a 
griffon's lair are plucked from the cliffs and eaten, or are 
knocked from the heights to go tumbling to their deaths. 
Trained Mounts. A griffon raised from an egg can be 
trained to serve as a mount. However, such training is 
time consuming, expensive (mostly for the ample food 
the creature requires), and dangerous. Expert trainers 
well versed in the griffon's legendary ferocity are typically 
the only ones able to raise these creatures safely. 
Once trained, a griffon is a fierce and loyal steed. It 
bonds with one master for life, fighting to the death to 
protect that rider. A griffon mount retains its ravenous 
appetite for horseflesh, and a wise master ensures that 
a griffon remains satiated with other prey when passing 
through civilized lands.

GRIMLOCK 
The degenerate subterranean grimlocks were once 
human, but their worship of the mind flayers over 
generations of prowling the Underdark transformed 
them into blind, monstrous cannibals long ago. 
Debased Cultists. The empire of the mind flayers 
once spread across many worlds, enslaving countless 
races. Among those were human cultures whose high 
priests the mind flayers subverted using their insidious 
powers of thought control. Those leaders gradually 
turned the faiths of their followers toward the illithids, 
which they worshiped as blasphemous deities. 
Over time, the rituals of these enslaved humans 
created fervent cannibal cults that regarded the brain 
eating of the mind flayers as a holy sacrament. The 
illithids commanded their worshipers to abduct other 
sentient creatures to be sacrificed. After the victims' 
brains had been consumed, the mind flayers gave the 
lifeless bodies to the cultists. 
Blind Hunters. When the rule of the mind flayers 
crumbled, their cults faced constant warfare from their 
enemies, the same creatures that had once been their 
victims. The cults fled into the Underdark domains of 
their illithid gods. Over generations in that lightless 
realm, the cultists learned to rely on their other senses 
for survival. In time, their eyes withered away and 
eyelids sealed, leaving only covered eye sockets behind. 
A grimlock's ears prick up at the faintest footfall or 
whisper echoing down stone passageways. It can speak 
in tones too low for most other humanoids to hear. The 
odors of sweat, flesh, and blood awaken its hunger, 
and it can track by such scents like a bloodhound. To 
enhance their senses, grim locks leave trails of blood, 
piles of dung, or the viscera of slain prey in places far 
from their lairs. When intruders pass through those 
areas, they carry the foul scents with them, warning the 
grimlocks of their approach. 
For most creatures, blindness is an enormous 
hindrance. For a grimlock with its other heightened 
senses, sightlessness is a boon. A grimlock isn't fooled 
by visual illusions or misperceptions. It is fearless as it 
stalks prey. 
Endless War. Grimlocks still venerate the mind 
flayers, serving them whenever possible. Grim locks also 
recall the war in which they were driven underground. 
To them, it has never ended. They continue to return 
to the surface world to abduct captives for their 
illithid masters.
