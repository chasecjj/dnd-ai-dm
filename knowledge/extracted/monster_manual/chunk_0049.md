Magic Resistance. The vrock has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak 
and one with its talons. 
Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. 
Talons. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage. 
Spores (Recharge 6). A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores 
extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around 
corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 
14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While 
poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage 
at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself 
on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also 
ends the effect on it. 
Stunning Screech (1fDay). The vrock emits a horrific screech. 
Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a 
demon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or 
be stunned until the end of the vrock's next turn.
