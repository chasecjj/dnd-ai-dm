ZOMBIES 
From somewhere in the darkness, a gurgling moan 
is heard. A form lurches into view, dragging one foot 
as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The 
zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to 
escape its grasp. 
Dark Servants. Sinister necromantic magic infuses 
the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as 
zombies that do their creator's bidding without fear or 
hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad 
in the moldering apparel they wore when put to 
rest, and carrying the stench of decay. 
Most zombies are made from humanoid 
remains, though the flesh and bones of any 
formerly living creature can be imbued with 
a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, 
usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some 
zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic 
saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, 
a crea~ure can't be restored to life except by 
powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell. 
A zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, 
its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A 
zombie left without orders simply stands in place 
and rots unless something comes along that it 
can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues 
it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living 
creature it encounters. 
Hideous Forms. Zombies appear as they did in life, 
showing the wounds that killed them. However, the 
magic that creates these vile creatures often takes 
time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a 
battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. 
The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from 
the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie 
might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and 
reeking after weeks in the water. 
Mindless Soldiers. Zombies take the most direct 
route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, 
tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble 
into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, 
clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks 
and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might 
step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through 
roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields 
littered with caltrops without hesitation. 
A zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish 
friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited 
to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, 
pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed 
with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a 
dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so. 
Undead Nature. A zombie doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep . .

Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage. 
Eye Ray. The zombie uses a random magical eye ray, choosing 
a target that it can see within 60 feet of it. 
1. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a 
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. 
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
2. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 
Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success. 
3. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 14 
Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
4. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must 
succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) 
force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit 
points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. 
If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or 
creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving 
throw. If the target is a Huge or larger non magical object 
or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot 
cube of it.
