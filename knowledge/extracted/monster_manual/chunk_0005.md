SPEED 
A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on 
its turn. For more information on speed, see the 
Player's Handbook. 
All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the 
monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-
based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. 
Some creatures have one or more of the following 
additional movement modes. 
BURROW 
A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that 
speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A 
monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a 
special trait that allows it to do so. 
CLIMB 
A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or 
part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The 
monster doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb. 
FLY 
A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part 
of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability 
to hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the 
air (as explained in the rules on flying in the Player's 
Handbook). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies. 
SWIM 
A monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need to 
spend extra movement to swim. 
ABILITY SCORES 
Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, 
Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and 
Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more 
information on ability scores and how they're used in 
play, see the Player's Handbook. 
SAVING THROWS 
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures 
that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. 
For example, a creature that isn't easily charmed or 
frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving 
throws . Most creatures don't have special saving throw 
bonuses, in which case this section is absent. 
A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant 
ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is 
determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown 
in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).

SKILLS 
The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are 
proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster 
that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses 
to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. 
A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant 
ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is 
determined by the monster's challenge rating (as 
shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating 
table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a 
monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus 
(usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for 
its heightened expertise. 
VULNERABILITIES, RESISTANCES, 
AND IMMUNITIES 
Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or 
immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, 
some creatures are immune to certain conditions. If a 
monster is immune to a game effect that isn't considered 
damage or a condition, it has a special trait. 
SENSES 
The Senses entry notes a monster's passive 
Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special 
senses the monster might have. Special senses are 
described below. 
BLINDSIGHT 
A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings 
without relying on sight, within a specific radius. 
Creatures without eyes, such as grim locks and gray 
oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures 
with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats 
and true dragons. 
If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical 
note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its 
blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.
