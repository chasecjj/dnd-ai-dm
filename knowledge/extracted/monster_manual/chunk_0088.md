LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; 
the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
• The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage 
on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until 
initiative count 20 on the next round. 
One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it 
must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or 
be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of exis-
tence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, 
the creature must use its action to make a Charisma 
check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, 
_il' escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect 
ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When 
the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space 
it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one 
is occupied.

with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its ·~on­
versation with the dragon upon waking.' 
• Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 
6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't ,obscu~e

in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.

·
