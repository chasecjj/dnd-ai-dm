At harvest time, when death revisits the twilit world and 
summer's blossoms bow their withered heads, eerie 
scarecrows loom in silent vigil over empty fields. With 
immortal patience, these stoic sentinels hold their posts 
through wind, storm, and flood, bound to their master's 
command, eager to terrify prey with its sackcloth visage 
and rend victims with its razor-sharp claws. 
Spirit-Powered Constructs. A scarecrow is animated 
by the bound spirit of a slain evil creature, granting it 
purpose and mobility. It is this uncanny presence from 
beyond death that allows a scarecrow to inspire fear 
in those it gazes upon. Hags and witches often bind 
scarecrows with the spirits of demons, but any evil spirit 
will do. Although aspects of the spirit's personality 
might surface, a scarecrow's spirit doesn't recall the 
memories it had as a creature, and its will is focused 
solely on serving its creator. If its creator dies, the spirit 
inhabiting a scarecrow either continues to follow its 
last commands, seeks revenge for its creator's death, or 
destroys itself. 
Construct Nature. A scarecrow doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.

SHADOW 
Shadows are undead that resemble dark exaggerations 
of humanoid shadows. 
Dark Disposition. From the darkness, the shadow 
reaches out to feed on living creatures' vitality. They 
can consume any living creature, but they are especially 
drawn to creatures untainted by evil. A creature that 
lives a life of goodness and piety consigns its basest 
impulses and strongest temptations to the darkness 
where the shadows hunger. As a shadow drains its 
victim's strength and physical form, the victim's shadow 
darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, 
the creature's shadow breaks free, becoming a new 
undead shadow hungry for more life to consume. 
If a creature from which a shadow has been created 
somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses 
the return. The shadow might seek its "parent" to 
vex or slay. Whether the shadow pursues its living 
counterpart, the creature that birthed the shadow no 
longer casts one until the monster is destroyed. 
Undead Nature. A shadow doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.

rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later.
