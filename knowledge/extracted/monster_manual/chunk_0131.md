GRICK 
The wormlike grick waits unseen, blending in with the 
rock of the caves and caverns it haunts. Only when prey 
comes near does it rear up, its four barbed tentacles 
unfurling to reveal its hungry, snapping beak. 
Passive Predators. Gricks rarely hunt. Instead, they 
drag their rubbery bodies to places where creatures 
regularly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble 
and debris, squeezing into burrows, holes, or crevices, 
climbing up to ledges, or coiling around stalactites 
to drop on unwary prey. A grick consumes virtually 
anything that moves except for other gricks. It targets 
the nearest prey, grabbing a fallen creature with its 
tentacles and dragging it off to eat alone. 
Roving Ambushers. Gricks remain in an area until 
the food supply dwindles, often because sentient 
creatures become aware of their presence and plot 
alternate routes around their lairs. When prey is scarce 
in the Underdark, gricks venture aboveground to hunt 
in the wilderness, lurking in trees or on cliff-side ledges. 
A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized 
alpha around which the others congregate. 
Spoils of Slaughter. Over time, grick lairs accumulate 
the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, and expert 
guides know to look out for these telltale signs. 
Underdark explorers sometimes seal off the routes 
leading to and from a grick lair to starve them, then 
claim the wealth of the foul creatures' victims.
