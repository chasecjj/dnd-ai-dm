ARMOR, WEAPON, AND TOOL PROFICIENCIES 
Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, 
and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the 
creature is proficient with its new equipment. 
For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and 
wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain 
mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is 
proficient with both, one or the other, or neither. 
See the Player's Handbook for rules on using armor or 
weapons without proficiency.

DARKVISION 
A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a 
specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within 
the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as 
if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in 
darkness, on ly shades of gray. Many creatures that live 
underground have this special sense. 
T'REMORSENSE 
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint 
the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, 
provided that the monster and the source of the 
vibrations are in contact with the same ground or 
substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or 
incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such 
as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense. 
T'RUESIGHT 
A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see 
in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures 
and objects, automatically detect visual iilusions and 
succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive 
the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that 
is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can 
see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range. 
LANGUAGES 
The languages that a monster can speak are listed 
in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can 
understand a language but can't speak it, and this is 
noted in its entry. A"- " indicates that a creature neither 
speaks nor understands any language. 
TELEPATHY 
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to 
communicate mentally with another creature within a 
specified range. The contacted creature doesn't need 
to share a language with the monster to communicate 
in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at 
least one language. A creature without telepathy can 
receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't 
initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation. 
A telepathic monster doesn't need to see a contacted 
creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. 
The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are 
no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic 
monster contacts a different creature within range. A 
telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic 
conversation without using an action, but while the 
monster is incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic 
contact, and any current contact is terminated. 
A creature within the area of an antimagic field or in 
any other location where magic doesn't function can't 
~e nd or receive telepathic messages.

CHALLENGE 
A monster's challenge rating tells you how great a 
threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and 
well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to 
defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its 
level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party 
of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with 
a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not 
a deadly one. 
Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level 
characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. 
Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant 
except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks 
are worth no experience points, while those that have 
attacks are worth 10 XP each. 
Some monsters present a greater challenge than 
even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These 
monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are 
specifically designed to test player skill. 
EXPERIENCE POINTS 
The number of experience points (XP) a monster is 
worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is 
awarded for defeating the monster, although the DM 
may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by 
the monster in some other manner. 
Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster 
summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth 
the XP noted in its stat block. 
The Dungeon Master's Guide explains how to create 
encounters using XP budgets, as well as how to adjust 
an encounter's difficulty.
