'424 
Modrons are beings of absolute law that adhere to a 
· . hive-like hierarchy. They inhabit the plane of Mechanus 
and tend its eternally revolving gears, their existence a 
clockwork routine of perfect order. 
Absolute Law and Order. Under the direction 
of their leader, Primus, modrons increase order in 
the multiverse in accordance with laws beyond the 
comprehension of·mortal minds. Their own minds 
are networked in a hierarchal pyramid, in which 
each modron receives commands from superiors and 
delegates orders to underlings. A mod ron carries out 
commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and 
an absence of morality or ego. 
Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is 
necessary to fulfill their duties. They exist as a unified 
collective, divided by ranks, yet they always refer to 
themselves collectively. To a modron, there is no "I," but 
only "we" or "us." 
Absolute Hierarchy. Modrons communicate only 
with their own rank and the ranks immediately above 
and below them. Modrons more than one rank away are 
either too advanced or too simple to understand. 
Cogs of the Great Machine. If a modron is destroyed, 
its remains disintegrate. A replacement from the next 
lowest rank then transforms in a flash of light, gaining 
the physical form of its new rank. The promoted mod ron 
is replaced by one of its underlings in the same manner, 
all t~e way to the lowest levels of the hierarchy. There, a 
new mod ron is created by Primus, with a steady stream 
of monodrones leaving the Great Modron Cathedral on 
Mechanus as a result. 
The Great Modron March. When the gears of 
Mechanus complete seventeen cycles once every 289 
years, Primus sends a vast army of modrons across the 
Outer Planes, ostensibly on a reconnaissance mission. 
The march is long and dangerous, and only a small 
number of modrons returns to Mechanus. 
MONODRONE 
A monodrone can perform one simple task at a time and 
can relay a single message of up to forty-eight words. 
DUODRONE 
The blocky duodrones supervise units of monodrones 
and can perform up to two tasks at a time. 
TRIDRONE 
Tridrones are shaped like inverted pyramids. They lead 
lesser modrons in battle. 
UADRONE 
Astute combatants, quadrones serve as artillery and 
field officers in the regiments of modron armies. 
PENTADRONE 
Pentadrones oversee Mechanus's worker populace and 
call improvise in response to new situations. 
A mod ron unit sometimes becomes defective, either through 
natural decay or exposure to chaotic forces. Rogue modrons 
don't act in accordance with Primus's wishes and directives, 
breaking laws, disobeying orders, and even engaging in 
violence. Other modrons hunt down such rogues. 
A rogue mod ron loses the Axiomatic Mind trait and can 
have any alignment other than lawful neutral. Otherwise, it 
has the same statistics as a regular mod ron of its rank.
