Multiattack. The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and 
one to constrict. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage. 
Constrict. Melee Weapon Attack: + 10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
Large or smaller creature. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning 
damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is 
grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a 
creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends. 
Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6). The behir exhales a line of 
lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature 
in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
Swallow. The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or 
smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also 
swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target 
is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks 
and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid 
damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can 
have only one creature swallowed at a time. 
If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from 
the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 
Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate 
the creature, which fa lls prone in a space within 10 feet of 
the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer 
restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet 
of movement, exiting prone.

BEHIR 
The serpentine behir crawls along floors and clambers 
up walls to reach its prey. Its lightning breath can 
incinerate most creatures, even as more powerful foes 
are constricted in its coils and eaten alive. 
A behir's monstrous form resembles a combination 
of centipede and crocodile. Its scaled hide ranges from 
ultramarine to deep blue in color, fading to pale blue on 
its underside. 
Cavern Predators. Behirs lair in places inaccessible 
to other creatures, favoring locations where would-be 
intruders must make a harrowing climb to reach them. 
Deep pits, high caves in cliff walls, and caverns reached 
only by narrow, twisting tunnels are prime sites for a 
behir ambush. A behir's dozen legs allow it to scramble 
through its lair site with ease. When not climbing, it 
moves even faster by folding its legs beside its body and 
slithering like a snake. 
Behirs swallow their prey whole, after which they 
enter a period of dormancy while they digest. While 
dormant, a behir chooses a hiding place where intruders 
in its lair might overlook it. 
Foes of the Dragons. In times long forgotten, 
giants and dragons engaged in seemingly endless 
war. Storm giants created the first behirs as weapons 
against the dragons, and behirs retain a natural hatred 
for dragonkind. 
A behir never makes its lair in an area it knows to be 
inhabited by a dragon. If a dragon attempts to establish 
a lair within a few dozen miles of a behir's lair, the behir , 
is compelled to kill the dragon or drive it off. Only if tlie 
dragon proves too powerful to fight does a behjr back " 
down, seeking out a new lair site a great distance away ..
