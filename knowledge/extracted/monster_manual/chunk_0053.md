Legends tell that the first erinyes were angels that 
fell from the Upper Planes because of temptation or 
misdeed. Erinyes are always willing to take advantage 
of being mistaken for celestials in their missions of 
conquest and corruption. 
HoRNED DEVIL (MALEBRANCHE) 
Horned devils are lazy to the point of belligerence and 
reluctant to put themselves in harm's way. Moreover, 
they hate and fear any creature stronger than 
themselves. When they are sufficiently provoked or 
antagonized, the fury of these fiends can be terrifying. 
A malebranche stands as tall as an ogre and is 
sheathed in scales as tough as iron. The flying infantry 
of the hellish legions, horned devils follow orders to the 
letter. Their huge wings and sweeping horns create an 
intimidating presence as they drop from the sky and 
strike with deadly forks and lashing tails. 
ICE DEVIL (GELUGON) 
Found most commonly on the cold layers of Stygia and 
Cania, ice devils serve as commanders of the infernal 
armies of the Nine Hells, tormenting lesser devils as 
an outlet for their anger and resentment. Coveting 
the power of their pit fiend superiors, ice devils work 
ceaselessly toward promotion, slaughtering the enemies 
of the Nine Hells and claiming as many souls as they 
can for their archdevil masters. 
Resembling a giant bipedal insect, an ice devil has 
clawed hands and feet, powerful mandibles, and a 
long tail covered in razor-sharp spikes. Some carry 
barbed spears whose icy touch can render a foe all but 
helpless in combat. 
IMP 
Imps are found throughout the Lower Planes, either 
running errands for their infernal masters, spying on 
rivals, or misleading and waylaying mortals. An imp will 
proudly serve an evil master of any kind, but it can't be 
relied on to carry out tasks with any speed or efficiency. 
An imp can assume animal form at will, but in its 
natural state it resembles a diminutive red-skinned 
humanoid with a barbed tail, small horns, and leathery 
wings. It strikes while invisible, attacking with 
its poison stinger. 
LEMURE 
A lemure arises when a mortal soul is twisted by evil 
and banished to the Nine Hells for eternity. The lowest 
type of devil, lemures are repugnant, shapeless creatures 
doomed to suffer torment until they are promoted to a 
higher form of devil, most commonly an imp. 
A lemure resembles a molten mass of flesh with 
a vaguely humanoid head and torso. A permanent 
expression of anguish twists across its face, its feeble 
mouth babbling even though it can't speak. 
VARIANT: IMP FAMILIAR 
Imps can be found in the service to mortal spellcasters, acting 
as advisors, spies, and familiars. An imp urges its master to 
acts of evil, knowing the mortal's soul is a prize the imp might 
ultimately claim. Imps display an unusual loyalty to their 
masters, and an imp can be quite dangerous if its master is 
threatened. Some such imps have the following trait. 
Familiar. The imp can enter into a contract to serve 
an<;>ther creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with 
its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can 
sense what the imp senses as long as they are within l mile 
of each other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, 
the master shares the imp's Magic Resistance trait. If its 
master violates the terms of the contract, the imp can end its 
service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond. 
PIT FIEND 
The undisputed lords of most other devils, pit fiends 
attend the archdukes and archduchesses of the Nine 
Hells and carry out their wishes. These mighty devils 
are the generals of the Nine Hells, leading its infernal 
legions into battle. 
With an inflated sense of superiority and entitlement, 
pit fiends form a grotesque aristocracy in the infernal 
realm. These domineering and manipulative tyrants 
conspire to eliminate anything that stands between 
them and their desires, even as they negotiate the 
convoluted and dangerous politics of the Nine Hells. 
A pit fiend is a hulking monster with a whip-like tail 
and enormous wings that it wraps around itself like a 
cloak. Armored scales cover its body, and its fanged 
maw drips a venom that can lay the mightiest mortal 
creatures low. Fearless in battle, a pit fiend takes on the 
most powerful foes in single combat, demonstrating 
its supremacy and an arrogance that prevents it from 
acknowledging any chance of defeat. 
SPINED DEVIL (SPINAGON) 
Smaller than most other devils, spinagons act as 
messengers and spies for greater devils and archdevils. 
They are the eyes and ears of the Nine Hells, and even 
fiends that despise a spined devil's weakness treat it 
with a modicum of respect. 
A spined devil's body and tail bristle with spines, and 
it can fling its tail spines as ranged weapons. The spines 
burst into flame on impact. 
When not delivering messages or gathering 
intelligence, spined devils serve in the infernal legions 
as flying artillery, making up for their relative weakness 
by mobbing together to overwhelm their foes. Though 
they crave promotion and power, spined devils are 
craven by nature, and they will quickly scatter if a fight 
goes against them.
