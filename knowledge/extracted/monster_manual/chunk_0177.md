Ogre Gangs. Ogres sometimes band together in 
small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of 
tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt 
to capture the members of the other group to increase 
its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to 
trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band 
is temporarily flush with food and weapons. 
Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other 
monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than 
themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, 
and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants' 
complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres 
rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an 
ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks. 
HALF-OGRE (0GRILLON) 
When an ogre mates with a human, hobgoblin, bugbear, 
or ore, the result is always a half-ogre. (Ogres don't 
mate with dwarves, halflings, or elves. They eat them.) 
Human mothers rarely survive the birth of a half-
ogre offspring. 
The half-ogre offspring of an ogre and an ore is also 
called an ogrillon. An adult half-ogre or ogrillon stands 
8 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds on average.

ONI 
In nursery rhymes, oni are fearsome bogeymen that 
haunt the nightmares of children and adults alike, yet 
they are very real and always hungry. They find human 
babies especially delicious. Oni look like demonic ogres 
with blue or green skin, dark hair, and a pair of short 
ivory horns protruding from their foreheads. Their eyes 
are dark with strikingly white pupils, and their teeth and 
claws are jet black. 
Night Haunters. By the light of day, an oni hides 
its true form with magic, gaining the trust of those 
it intends to betray when darkness descends. These 
creatures can change their size as well as their shape, 
appearing as humanoids as they pass through towns, 
pretending to be travelers, woodcutters, or frontier folk. 
In such a form, an oni takes stock of the selection of 
humanoids in a settlement and devises ways to abduct 
and devour some of them. 
Magical Ogres. Oni are sometimes called ogre mages 
because of their innate magical ability. Though they 
are only distantly related to true ogres, they share the 
ogres' habit of joining forces with other evil creatures. 
An oni serves a master if doing so proves lucrative or 
provides it with a luxurious, well-defended home. Oni 
covet magic, and they work for evil wizards and hags in 
exchange for useful magic items.

Innate Spellcasting. The oni's innate spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 13). The oni can innately cast the 
following spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: darkness, invisibility 
1/day each: charm person, cone of cold, gaseous form, sleep 
Magic Weapons. The oni's weapon attacks are magical. 
Regeneration. The oni regains 10 hit points at the start of its 
turn if it has at least 1 hit point. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The oni makes two attacks, either with its claws 
or its glaive. 
Claw (Oni Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 
ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage. 
Glaive. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing 
damage in Small or Medium form. 
Change Shape. The oni magically polymorphs into a Small or 
Medium humanoid, into a Large giant, or back into its true 
form. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each 
form. The only equipment that is transformed is its glaive, 
which shrinks so that it can be wielded in humanoid form. If 
the oni dies, it reverts to its true form, and its glaive reverts to 
its normal size.
