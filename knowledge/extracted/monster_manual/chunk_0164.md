MERFOLK 
Aquatic humanoids with the upper body of a human and 
the lower body of a fish, merfolk adorn their skin and 
scales with shell decorations. 
Merfolk tribes and kingdoms span the world, and 
their people are as varied in color, culture, and outlook 
as the human races of the surface. Land folk and 
mer folk rarely meet except by chance, though star-eyed 
mariners tell tales of romance with these creatures 
along the shoals of faraway islands. 
Merfolk lack the materials and practical means to 
forge weapons beneath the waves, to write books and 
keep lore, or to shape stone to raise buildings and 
cities. As a result, most live in small hunter-gatherer 
tribes, each of which holds unique values and creeds. 
Only occasionally do mer folk unite under the rule of a 
single leader. They do so to face a common threat or 
to complete a conquest. Such unifications can be the 
beginning of undersea kingdoms with dynasties lasting 
hundreds of years. 
Merfolk Settlements. Merfolk build their settlements 
in vast undersea caverns, mazes of coral, the ruins of 
sunken cities, or structures they carve from the rocky 
seabed. They live in water shallow enough that the 
passage of time can be marked by the gleam and fade 
of sunlight through the water. In the reefs and trenches 
near their settlements, merfolk harvest coral and farm 
the seabed, shepherding schools of fish as land-based 
farmers tend sheep. Only rarely do merfolk venture into 
the darkest depths of the ocean. In such depths and 
in their undersea caverns, merfolk rely on the light of 
bioluminescent flora and fauna, such as jellyfish, whose 
slow pulsing movements lend merfolk settlements an 
otherworldly aesthetic. 
Merfolk defend their communities with spears 
crafted from whatever materials they can salvage from 
shipwrecks, beaches, and dead undersea creatures.

MERROW 
Merrow haunt coastal waters, preying on fisherfolk, 
merfolk, and any other edible creature that crosses their 
path. These savage monsters snatch and devour unwary 
prey, hauling drowned corpses back to their underwater 
grottoes to feed. 
Transformed Merfolk. Long ago, a tribe of merfolk 
found an idol of Demogorgon at the bottom of the sea. 
Not knowing what it was, they brought the artifact 
to their king. Everyone who touched the idol became 
afflicted with madness, including the king, who decreed 
that a sacrificial ritual be performed to open a gateway 
to the Abyss. The ocean turned red with the blood of 
slaughtered merfolk, but the ritual worked, and the 
king led the survivors through the underwater gate 
to Demogorgon's layer of the Abyss. The merfolk 
remained there for generations, fighting for their lives 
as the Abyss warped them completely, transforming 
them into hulking, evil monstrosities. Thus, the first 
merrow were born. 
Coastal Bullies. Whenever an opportunity presents 
itself, the Prince of Demons sends merrow back to 
the Material Plane to wreak havoc in the oceans. The 
merrow are bullies, attacking all creatures smaller and 
weaker than themselves. 
Merrow dwell in undersea caves filled with treasures 
and trophies, taken from their victims and sunken 
ships. They tie the rotting corpses of dead enemies and 
drowned sailors to strands of kelp to mark the borders 
of their territory.
