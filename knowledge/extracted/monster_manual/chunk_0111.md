GENIES 
Genies are rare elemental creatures out of story 
and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material 
Plane. The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where 
they rule from lavish palaces and are attended by 
worshipful slaves. 
Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud 
as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have 
a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the 
knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other 
genies can challenge their power. 
Creatures of the Elements. A genie is born when 
the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the 
primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under 
rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul 
coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie. 
A genie usually retains no connection to the soul 
that gave it form. That life force is a building block that 
determines the genie's form and apparent gender, as 
well as one or two key personality traits. Although they 
resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits 
given physical form. They don't mate with other genies 
or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born 
out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and 
elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection 
to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a 
mortal, although such offspring are rare. 
When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind 
except what it was wearing or carrying, along with 
a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a 
gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of 
water and foam. 
Rule or Be Ruled. Mortal slaves serve to validate 
a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred 
flattering voices are music to a genie's ears, while 
two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are 
proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as 
living property, and a genie without property amounts 
to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many 
genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored 
members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten 
and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the 
slaves are no longer of use. 
In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe 
being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the 
will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. 
All genies command the power of their native element, 
but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. 
For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind 
genies into service. 
Decadent Nobility. Noble genies are the rarest of 
their kind. They are used to getting what they want, 
and have learned to trade their ability to grant wishes 
to attain the objects of their desire. This constant 
indulgence has made them decadent, while their 
supreme power over reality makes them haughty and 
arrogant. Their vast palaces overflow with wonders and 
sensory delights beyond imagination. 
Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other 
genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. 
Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies, 
knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can 
alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholden to any 
noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy 
a noble genie's will and risk the consequences. 
The Power of Worship. Genies acknowledge the 
gods as powerful entities but have no desire to c9urt 
or worship them. They find the endless fawning and 
mew ling of religious devotees tiresome-except a;> it is 
directed toward them by their worshipful slaves. .;, 
Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their 
abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some 
genies to deceive themselves into believing they,are 
as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to deii-tand 
that mortals of other realms- even whole contin'ents or 
worlds- bow down before them. 
DAO 
Dao are greedy, malicious genies from the Elemental 
Plane of Earth. They adorn themselves with jewelry 
crafted from precious gems and rare metals, and when 
they fly, their lower bodies become columns of swirling 
sand. A dao isn't happy unless it is the envy of other dao. 
All That Glitters. The dao dwell in complexes of 
twisting tunnels and glittering ore-veined caverns 
on the Elemental Plane of Earth. These mazeworks 
are continually expanding as the dao delve into and 
reshape the rock around them. Dao care nothing for 
the poverty or misfortune of others. A dao might grind 
powdered gems and gold dust over its food to heighten 
the experience of eating, devouring its wealth as mortals 
consume a precious spice. 
Lords of the Earth. A dao never assists a mortal 
unless the genie has something to gain, preferably 
treasure. Among the genies, dao are on speaking and 
trading terms with the efreet, but they have nothing 
but scorn for djinn and marids. Other races native to 
the Elemental Plane of Earth avoid the dao, which are 
always seeking new slaves to mine the mazeworks of 
their floating earth islands. 
Proud Slavers. The dao trade for the finest slaves 
that money can buy, forcing them to work in dangerous 
subterranean realms that rumble with earthquakes. 
As much as they enjoy enslaving others, the dao 
hate being enslaved. Powerful wizards have been 
known to lure dao to the Material Plane and trap them 
in the confines of magic gemstones or iron flasks. 
Unfortunately for the dao, their greed makes it relatively 
easy for mages to cozen them into service. 
DJINNI 
Proud, sensuous genies from the Elemental Plane 
of Air, the djinn are attractive, tall, well-muscled 
humanoids with blue skin and dark eyes. They dress in 
airy, shimmering silks, designed as much for comfort as 
to flaunt their musculature. 
Airy Aesthetes. Djinn rule floating islands of 
clouds tuff covered with enormous pavilions, or topped 
with wondrous buildings, courtyards, fountains, and 
gardens. Creatures of comfort and ease, djinn enjoy 
succulent fruits, pungent wines, fine perfumes, and 
beautiful music.
