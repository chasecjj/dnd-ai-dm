summon fiends to tne' material world to do their bidding. 
If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost 
inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell 
hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths. 
Giants tower over humans and their kind. They are 
humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads 
(ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of 
true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire 
giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, 
creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants. 
Humanoids are the main peoples of the D&D 
world, both civilized and savage, including humans 
and a tremendous variety of other species. They have 
language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities 
(though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a 
bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are 
the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, 
dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but 
far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, 
are the races of goblinoids (gol:ilins, hobgoblins, and 
bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds. 
A variety of humanoids appear throughout this book, 
but the races detailed in the Player's Handbook- with 
the exception of drow-are dealt with in appendix B. 
That appendix gives you a number of stat blocks that 
you·can use to make various members of those races. 
-Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense-
frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly 
natural, and almost never benign. Some are the 
results of magical experimentation gone awry (such 
as owl bears), and others ,are the product-of terrible 
curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy 
categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all 
category for creatures that don't fit into any other type. 
Oozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a 
fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling 
in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, 
or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black 
puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most 
recognizable oozes. 
Plants in this context are vegetable creatures, not 
ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some 
are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the 
shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures 
such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into 
this category. 
Undead are once-living creatures brought to a 
horrifying state of undeath through the practice of 
necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead 
include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, 
as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters. 
TAGS 
A monster might have one or more tags appended to 
its type, in parentheses. For example, an ore has the 
hum~noid (ore) type. The parenthetical tags provide 
additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags 
have no rules of their own, but something in the game, 
such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, 
a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons 
would work aga~nst any monster that has the demon tag. 
ALIGNMENT 
A monster's alignment provides a clue to its di~positiron 
and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. 
For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult 
to reason with and might attack characters on sight, 
whereas a neutral monster might be willing to Regotiate. 
See the Player's Handbook for descriptions of the ' 
different alignments. 
, 
The alignment specified in a monster's stat blo~k 'is· 
the default. Feel free to depart from it and' ch'ange a 
monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign.-
Ifyou want a good-aligned green dragon or ari-evil'storm · 
giant, there's nothing stopping you. 
' 
Some creatures can have any alignment. In ~ther 
words, you choose the monster's alignment. Some 
monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or '' 
aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, 
a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, 
chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature. 
Many creatures of low intelligence have no 
comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't 
make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. 
These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't 
have an alignment. 
ARMOR CLASS 
A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has 
an Armor Class (A C) that takes its armor, shield, and 
Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is 
based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, 
if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, 
or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after 
its AC value. 
HIT POINTS 
A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it 
drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the ' 
Player's Handbook. 
A monster's hit points are presented both as a die 
expression and as an average number. For example, 
a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on 
average (2 x 4Y2). 
A monster's size determines the die used to calculate 
its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.

A monster's Constitution modifier also affects the 
number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is 
multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and 
the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a } 
monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) an'd 2cl8 
Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11). r
