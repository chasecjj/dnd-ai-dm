Djinn are known for their sense of mischief and their 
favorable attitude toward mortals. Among genies, djinn 
deal coolly with efreet and marids, whom they view as 
· haughty. They openly !fespise dao and strike against 
them with little provocation. 
Masters of the Wind. Masters of the air, the djinn ride 
powerful whirlwinds that they create and direct on a 
whim, and which can even carry passengers. Creatures 
that stand against a djinni are assaulted by wind and 
thunder, even as the djinni spins away on that wind if 
outmatched in combat. When a djinni flies, its lower 
body transforms into a column of swirling air. 
Accepting Servitors. The djinn believe that servitude 
is a matter of fate, and that no being can contest the 
hand of fate. As a result, of all the g(1nies, djinn are the 
ones most amenable to servitude, though they never 
enjoy it. Djinn treat their slaves more like servants 
deserving of kindness and protection, and they part with 
them reluctantly. 
A mortal who desires the brief service of a djinni can 
entreat it with fine gifts, or use flattery to bribe it into 
Gompliance. Powerful wizards are able to forgo such 
niceties, however, if they can summon, bind into service, 
or imprison a djinni using magic. Long-term service 
displeases a djinni, and imprisonment is inexcusable. 
Djin11 resent the cruel wizards that have imprisoned 
their" kind in bottles, iron flasks, and wind instruments 
throughout the ages. Betrayal, particularly by a mortal 
whom a djinni trusted, is a vile deed that only deadly 
vengeance can amend. 
EFREETI 
Hulking genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, the efreet 
aPe masters of flame, immune to fire and able to create 
it on a whim. Fine silk caftans and damask robes drape 
their magma-red or coal-black skin, and they bedeck 
themselves in brass and gold torcs, chains, and rings, 
all glittering with jewels. When an efreeti flies, its lower 
body transforms into a column of smoke and embers. 
Haughty and Cruel. The efreet are deceptive, 
cunning, and cruel to the point of ruthlessness. They 
despise being forced into servitude and are relentless 
in pursuit of vengeance against creatures that have 
wronged them. Efreet don't see themselves in this light, 
naturally, and regard their race as fair and orderly, even 
as they admit to an enlightened sense of self-interest. 
Spiteful Slavers. Efreet view all other creatures 
as enemies or potential serfs. They raid the Material 
Plane and the elemental planes for slaves, which they 
capture and bring back to their homes on the Elemental 
Plane of Fire. The efreet rule as oppressive tyrants, 
promoting only the cruelest among their slaves. Those 
overseers are given whips to help keep the rank-and-file 
slaves in line. 
Planar Raiders. Most efreet reside on the Elemental 
Plane of Fire, either in great domed fortresses of black 
glass and basalt surrounded by churning lakes of fire, or 
in the fabled City of Brass. Additionally, efreet military 
outposts thronging with their minions and slaves can be 
found scattered throughout the planes. 
On the Material Plane, efreet dwell in fiery regions 
such as v0lcanoes and the burning expanses of the

world's deserts." IT'heir love of the ·~bert tliiings them into 
conflict with'the djinn that ride the desert whirlwinds, 
and with the earthbound dao. Efreet utterly despise 
marids, with whom they have maintained a passionate 
c~nflict throughout the history of both races. 
MARID 
Hailing from the Elemental Plane of Water, the marids 
are the most wondrous of genie-kind. Although all 
genies wield great power, even the lowliest marid sees 
itself as clearly superior to the flighty djinn, the ground-
hugging dao, and the fuming efreet. 
Large and piscine, marids are a strange sight to 
behold, particularly when clad in the finely stitched vests 
and colorful pantaloons they favor. They speak in voices 
as soft as the sea breeze or as sonorous as storm waves 
breaking against a rocky cliff. In flight, their lower 
bodies transform into columns of foamy water. 
Water Lords. Water is a marid's native element, 
and the genie can manipulate water in virtually any 
way it desires. A marid can walk on water and breathe 
naturally beneath its surface. It can create water or 
shape clouds of fog and mist from the vapor in the air. 
It can even transform itself into mist, or use water as a 
weapon to bludgeon its foes. 
Marid Homes. Marids are rare on the Material Plane. 
They inhabit mighty and majestic coral fortresses 
located in the Elemental Plane of Water. These citadels 
float in the depths of the plane and contain opulent, air-
filled chambers where slaves and guests reside. 
A marid doesn't expect much from its slaves, simply 
wanting to have them for the status of ownership. 
Marids go out of their way to obtain skilled slaves, and 
aren't above kidnapping mortal artists, entertainers, or 
storytellers for use in their courts. 
Egotistical Hierarchs. All mar ids claim a title of 
nobility, and the race is awash in shahs, sultans, muftis, 
and khedives. Most of these titles are mere pretense on 
the part of the self-important marids. 
Marids treat all others-including other genies- as 
inferiors of various grades, ranging from poor cousins to 
petty annoyances. They tolerate djinn, dislike dao, and 
despise efreet. 
Humanoids are among the lowest of the creatures 
that marids must tolerate, although they sometimes 
deal with powerful wizards and exceptional leaders 
on an almost-equal footing. Doing so has sometimes 
proven to be a mistake, since wizards have managed to 
imprison marids in conch shells, flasks, and decanters 
over the ages. Bribery and flattery are the best means of 
dealing with marids, to which an obsequious mortal is a 
creature that knows its place. 
Whimsical Storytellers. Marids are champion tale-
tellers, whose favorite legends emphasize the prowess 
of marids in general and of the speaker in particular. 
Fanciful genies, they lie often and creatively. They aren't 
always malicious in their deception, but embellishments 
suit their fancy. Marids consider it a crime for a lesser 
being to interrupt one of their tales, and offending a 
marid is a sure way to invoke its wrath.
