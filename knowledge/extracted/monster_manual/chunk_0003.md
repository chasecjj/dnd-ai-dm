ThE WILDERNESS 
Not all monsters lurk underground. Many of them 
inhabit deserts, mountains, swamps, canyons, forests, 
and other natural settings. The wilderness can be just 
as dangerous as any dungeon, particularly when there's 
nowhere to hide! Some wilderness locations are just as 
memorable as any dungeon: 
• A roc's nest made of shattered ship hulls, built atop a 
lonely mountain or rocky hill 
A vast arctic tundra that serves as a hunting ground 
for berserkers and yeti 
A primeval forest protected by treants or corrupted by 
demon-worshiping gnolls 
A fog-shrouded swamp haunted by lizardfolk that 
worship a vile black dragon 
A jungle island inhabited by dinosaurs and human 
tribal warriors 
TOWNS AND CITIES 
Some of the best adventures unfold in the cradles of 
civilization. Urban settings afford adventurers the 
chance to rub shoulders with the rich and powerful, butt 
heads with the dregs of society, and peel back the veneer 
of civility to see the monstrous evil lurking beneath. 
Within a medieval town or city are places as deadly as 
any dungeon: 
• A clock tower that serves as a base for a guild of 
kenku rogues and assassins 
• A slavers' den hidden in an orphanage run by a 
rakshasa disguised as the headmaster 
A wizard's academy rife with corruption and practi-
tioners of the necromantic arts 
A noble's manor where rich, devil-worshiping cultists 
gather to perform sacrifices 
• A temple, vault, or museum watched day and night by 
animated constructs 
UNDERWATER 
Not all adventures take place on land. This book casts 
light on several creatures that haunt the oceans of the 
world, from the devilish sahuagin to the peaceful aquatic 
elves who loathe them. Within this aquatic domain are 
many surprising adventure locations: 
• A graveyard of sunken ships haunted by sharks, 
aquatic ghouls, and angry ghosts 
• A storm giant's coral castle, beautiful yet foreboding 
• A lost city on the sea floor, encased in a magic bubble 
of air and ruled by a medusa queen 
A kraken's cave or bronze dragon's cavernous lair, 
filled with ancient treasures 
A sunken temple of Sekolah, evil god of the sahuagin 
THE PLANES OF EXISTENCE 
The Abyss. The Nine Hells. The City of Brass. Such 
faraway places beckon high-level adventurers to their 
doorsteps, defying the brave and the foolhardy to 
overthrow their evil masters and unlock their hidden 
mysteries. Many powerful, weird creatures live on other

planes of existence, from orderly modrons to murderous 
demons. When it comes to interesting adventure 
locations, not even the sky is the limit when you pass 
beyond the boundaries of the world: 
• A pit fiend's stronghold on A vern us, the first layer of 
the Nine Hells 
• A haunted castle in the Shadowfell that serves as a 
shadow dragon's lair 
An elf queen's tomb in the Feywild 
A djinni's palace on the Elemental P lane of Air, filled 
with marvelous stolen treasures 
A lich's secret demiplane, where the undead arch mage 
hides its phylactery and spellbook 
See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information 
on the planes of existence. 
WHAT MoNSTERS TO UsE? 
Many monsters inhabit dungeons, while others live in 
deserts, forests, labyrinths, and other environments. 
Regardless of which environment a monster 
traditionally calls home, you can place it anywhere 
you want. After all, "fish out of water" stories are 
memorable, and sometimes it's fun to surprise players 
with gricks hiding under the desert sands or a dryad 
living in a giant mushroom in the Underdark. 
STATISTICS 
A monster's statistics, sometimes referred to as its stat 
block, provide the essential information that you need 
to run the monster. 
SIZE 
A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, 
or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how 
much space a creature of a particular size controls 
in combat. See the Player's Handbook for more 
information on creature size and space.

M O DIFYING CREATURES 
Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, 
you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect 
creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an 
existing creature to make it into something more useful for 
you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different 
monster or by using a variant or template, su~h as the 
ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, 
including when you apply a template to it, might change its 
challenge rating. 
For advice on how to customize creatures and calculate 
their challenge ratings, see the Dungeon Master's Guide.

A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. 
Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other 
effects in the game interact in special ways with 
creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of 
dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons 
but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as 
dragon turtles and wyverns. 
The game includes the following monster types, which 
have no rules of their own. 
Aberrations are utterly alien beings. Many of them 
have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's 
alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. 
The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, 
mind fiayers, and slaadi. 
Beasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural 
part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical 
powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society 
or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary 
animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals. 
Celestials are creatures native to the Upper Planes. 
Many of them are the servants of deities, employed 
as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and 
throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, 
so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good 
alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include 
angels, couatls, and pegasi. 
Constructs are made, not born. Some are 
programmed by their creators to'follow a simple set of 
instructions, while others are imbued with sentience 
and capable of independent thought. Golems are the 
iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer 
plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs 
shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of 
more powerful creatures. 
Dragons are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin 
and tremendous power. True dragons, including the 
good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, 
are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this 
category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, 
but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such 
as wyverns and pseudodragons. 
Elementals are creatures native to the elemental 
planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than 
animate masses of their respective elements, including 
the creatures simply called elementals. Others have 
biological forms infused with elemental energy. The 
races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the 
most important civilizations on the elemental planes. 
Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible 
stalkers, and water weirds. 
Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of 
nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. 
In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also 
called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the 
Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the 
Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs. 
Fiends are creatures of wickedness that are native 
to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, 
but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils 
and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes
