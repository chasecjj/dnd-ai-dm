Roc 
At first sight, a roc's silhouette looks much like any other 
bird of prey. As it descends, however, its unearthly size 
becomes terrifyingly clear. In flight, a roc's wingspan 
spreads two hundred feet or more. At rest, perched upon 
the mountain peaks that are its home, this monstrous 
bird rivals the oldest dragons in size. 
Sky Titans. In the ancient days when giants battled 
dragons for control of the world, Ann am, the father of 
the giant gods, created the roes so that his worshipers 
might challenge the dragons' dominance of the air. 
When the war ended, the roes were freed from giant 
domination and spread throughout the world. 
Though cloud giants and storm giants sometimes 
tame these great birds, roes treat even giants as 
potential prey. They fly great distances in search of food, 
soaring high above the clouds to reach their favored 
hunting grounds. A roc seldom hunts swift or small 
creatures, and it ignores towns and forests where prey 
can easily take cover. When it locates a large and slow-
moving target such as a giant, a whale, or an elephant, a 
roc dives down to snatch its prey in its massive talons. 
Remote and Alone. Roes are solitary creatures 
that can live for centuries. They lair in nests made 
from trees, tents, broken ships, and the remains of 
caravans they carry off, placing these massive tangles in 
mountain clefts out of the reach of lesser creatures. 
Sometimes a roc's nest contains treasures from the 
caravans or ships they raid, but these creatures are 
heedless of such baubles. More rarely, a nest holds eggs 
that are taller than a human, produced by the roes' 
infrequent mating.

ROPER 
Living in caves and caverns throughout the Underdark, 
voracious ropers feast on whatever they can catch and 
seize. A roper eats any creature, from Underdark beasts 
to adventurers and their gear. 
A roper has the appearance of a stalagmite or 
stalactite, which often allows it to attack with surprise. 
The creature can move slowly using thousands of 
sticky cilia beneath its base. It creeps up cave walls 
and along stone ceilings, finding the best position from 
which to attack. 
Underdark Hunters. The roper is an evolved, 
mature form of piercer, with which it shares its rock-
like appearance and hunting tactics. A roper can hold 
still for long hours, shutting its single eye to look like 
nothing more than a mundane formation of rock. 
Creatures that come too close are surprised when 
that eye snaps open and sticky tendrils shoot out 
to seize them. The roper then makes horrible 
guttural sounds as it reels in its struggling 
victims, drawing them close for the fatal bite of 
its stony teeth. 
A roper can digest anything it eats with the 
exception of platinum, gemstones, and magic 
items ,'~hich can sometimes be retrieved from the 
creature's gizzard after death. A roper's digestive juices 
are also valuable, fetching a high price from alchemists 
who use them as a solvent. 
Weakening Tendrils. A roper has six nubs set 
along its body, through which it extrudes sticky 
tendrils that bond to whatever they touch. Each 
tendril sends out hair-like growths that penetrate 
a creature's flesh and sap its strength, so the 
victim can struggle only weakly as the roper 
reels it in. If a tendril is cut through or broken, 
the roper produces a new one to replace it.

False Appearance. While the roper remains motionless, it is 
indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a 
stalagmite. 
Grasping Tendrils. The roper can have up to six tendrils at 
a time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; 
immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril 
cleals no damage to the roper, which <1an extrude a repla<1ement 
tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a ' 
creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength 
check against it. 
Spider Climb. The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including 
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The roper makes four attacks with its tendrils, 
uses Reel, and makes one attack with its bite. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) piercing damage. 
Tendril. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 50 ft., one 
creature. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the 
grapple ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage 
on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the roper 
can't use the same tendril on another target. 
Reel. The roper pulls each creature grappled by it up to 25 feet 
straight toward it.
