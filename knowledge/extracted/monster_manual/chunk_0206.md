SPHINXES 
In sacred isolation, a sphinx guards the secrets and 
treasures of the gods. As it calmly regards each new 
party that comes before it, the bones of supplicants and 
quest seekers that failed to pass its tests lie scattered 
around its lair. Its great wings sweep along its flanks, its 
tawny leonine body rippling with muscle and possessed 
of forepaws powerful enough to tear a humanoid in half. 
Divine Guardians. Sphinxes test the worth of those 
who seek the treasures of the gods, whether forgotten 
secrets or mighty spells, artifacts or magical gateways. 
Creatures that choose to face a sphinx's test are bound 
to that test unto death, and only those worthy will 
survive it. The rest the sphinx destroys. 
Some sphinxes are high priests of the gods that 
create them, but most are simply embodied spirits, 
brought into the mortal realm by devout prayer or direct 
intervention. A sphinx maintains its vigil tirelessly, not 
needing to sleep or eat. It rarely engages with others of 
its kind, knowing no other life except its sacred mission. 
Magical Tests. The secrets and treasures a sphinx 
guards remain under divine protection, so that when 
a creature fails a sphinx's test, the path to the object 
or knowledge it guards vanishes. Even if a sphinx is 
attacked and defeated, a quester will still fail to gain the 
secret it sought- and will make an enemy of the god that 
placed the sphinx as a guardian. 
Benign deities sometimes grant a sphinx the power 
to remove supplicants that fail their tests, transporting 
them away and ensuring that they never encounter the 
sphinx again. However, those who fail a sphinx's test 
typically meet a gruesome end beneath its claws. 
Extraplanar Beings. Mortals that encounter sphinxes 
do so most often in ancient tombs and ruins, but some 
sphinxes can access extra planar realms. A conversation 
with a sphinx that begins between tumbled stone 
walls might suddenly shift to an alien locale, such as a 
life-sized game board or a daunting cliff that must be 
climbed in a howling storm. Sometimes a sphinx must 
be summoned from such an extradimensional space, 
with supplicants calling it from its empty lair. Only those 
the sphinx deems worthy gain admittance to its realm. 
FaJJen Sphinxes. Whether through the weariness of 
the ages, regret at the slaughter of innocents, or dreams 
of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their 
way to knowledge, some sphinxes break free of their 
divine command. However, even if a sphinx's alignment 
and loyalties drift in this way, it never leaves the place 
it guards or grants its secrets to any except creatures it 
deem.s worthy.

ANDROSPHINX 
An androsphinx bears the head of a humanoid male 
on its lion's body. Outwardly gruff and downcast, it 
often begins conversations with insults or negative 
observations. Beneath this gruff exterior, however, an 
androsphinx has a noble heart. It has no wish to lie or 
deceive, but it doesn't give away information readily, 
choosing its words as wisely as it guards its secrets. 
An androsphinx tests the courage and valor of 
supplicants, not only by forcing them to complete quests 
but also with its terrible roar, which echoes for miles 
as it terrifies and deafens nearby creatures. Those who 
pass its tests may be rewarded with a heroes' feast. 
GYNOSPHINX 
A gynosphinx bears the head of a humanoid female. 
Many have the regal countenances of worldly queens, 
but some are marked with wild, leonine features. A 
gynosphinx's eyes see beyond the present time and 
place, and penetrate veils of invisibility and magic. 
Supplicants who look deep into those eyes might find 
themselves magically displaced, banished to some far-
flung plane where a difficult trial awaits them. 
Gynosphinxes are virtual libraries of knowledge 
and lore. They ask riddles and present puzzles to test 
the wit of supplicants that come to learn their secrets. 
Some are willing to bargain with such supplicants for 
treasure or service. 
A SPHINX'S LAIR 
A sphinx presides over an ancient temple, sepulcher, 
or vault, within which are hidden divine secrets and 
treasures beyond the reach of mortals. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sphinx 
can take a lair action to cause one of the following 
magical effects; the sphinx can't use an effect again until 
it finishes a short or long rest: 
The flow of time is altered such that every creature in 
the lair must reroll initiative. The sphinx can choose 
not to reroll. 
• The effects of time are altered such that every crea-
ture in the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or become 1d20 years older or younger 
(the sphinx's choice), but never any younger than 1 
year old. A greater restoration spell can restore a crea-
ture's age to normal. 
The flow of time within the lair is altered such that 
everything within moves up to 10 years forward or 
backward (sphinx's choice). Only the sphinx is imme-
diately aware of the time change. A wish spell can 
return the caster and up to seven other creatures des-
ignated by the caster to their normal time. 
The sphinx shifts itself and up to seven other crea-
tures it can see within in its lair to another plane of 
existence. Once outside its lair, the sphinx can't use 
lair actions, but it can return to its lair as a bonus 
action on its turn, taking up to seven creatures with it.
