GOLEMS 
Golems are made from humble materials-clay, flesh 
and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess astonishing 
power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, 
needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no 
remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow 
its creator's orders, and it protects or attacks as that 
creator demands. 
To create a golem, one requires a manual of golems 
(see the Dungeon Master's Guide). The comprehensive 
illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the 
process for creating a golem of a particular type. 
Elemental Spirit in Material Form. The construction 
of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring 
great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, 
ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a go I em's creator 
is the master of the art, but often the individual 
who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to 
do the work. 
After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or 
stone, the golem's creator infuses it with a spirit from 
the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life 
has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the 
impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit 
to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the 
golem's creator. 
Ageless Guardians. Golems can guard sacred sites, 
tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of 
their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for 
all eternity while brushing off physical damage and 
ignoring all but the most potent spells. 
A golems can be created with a special amulet or 
other item that allows the possessor of the item to 
control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead 
can thus be harnessed to serve a new master. 
Blind Obedience. When its creator or possessor is 
on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If 
the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, 
it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its 
ability. When it can't fulfill its orders, a golem might 
react violently-or stand and do nothing. A golem that 
has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates 
between them. 
A golem can't think or act for itself. Though it 
understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp 
of language beyond that understanding, and can't be 
reasoned with or tricked with words. 
Constructed Nature. A golem doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.

CLAY GOLEM 
Sculpted from clay, this bulky golem stands head and 
shoulders taller than most human-sized creatures. It is 
human shaped, but its proportions are off. 
Clay golems are often divinely endowed with purpose 
by priests of great faith. However, clay is a weak vessel 
for life force. If the golem is damaged, the elemental 
spirit bound into it can break free. Such a golem · 1 
runs. amok, smashing everything around it until it i~ 
destroyed or completely repaired. 
FLESH GOLEM 
A flesh golem is a grisly assortment of humanoid body 
parts stitched and bolted together into a muscled brute 
imbued with formidable strength. Its brain is capable 
of simple reason, though its thoughts are no more 
sophisticated than those of a young child. The golem's 
muscle tissue responds to the power of lightning, 
invigorating the creature with vitality and strength. 
Powerful enchantments protect the golem's skin, 
deflecting spells and all but the most potent weapons. 
A flesh golem lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not 
in complete control of its body. Its dead flesh isn't an 
ideal container for an elemental spirit, which sometimes 
howls incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit 
breaks free of its creator's will, the golem goes berserk 
until calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or 
completely healed. 
IRON GOLEM 
The mightiest of the golems, the iron golem is a 
massive, towering giant wrought of heavy metal. An 
iron golem's shape can be worked into any form, though 
most are fashioned to look like giant suits of armor. Its 
fist can destroy creatures with a single blow, and its 
clanging steps shake the earth beneath its feet. Iron 
golems wield enormous blades to extend their reach, 
and all can belch clouds of deadly poison. 
An iron golem's body is smelted with rare tinctures 
and admixtures. Though other golems bear weaknesses 
inherent in their materials or the power of the elemental 
spirit bound within them, iron golems were designed 
to be nearly invulnerable. Their iron bodies imprison 
the spirits that drive them, and are susceptible only 
to weapons imbued with magic or the strength 
of adamantine. 
STONE GoLEM 
Stone golems display great variety in shape and form, 
cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive 
statues. Though most bear humanoid features, stone 
golems can be carved in any form the sculptor can 
imagine. Ancient stone golems found in sealed tombs 
or flanking the gates of lost cities sometimes take the 
forms of giant beasts. 
Like other golems, stone golems are nearly 
impervious to spells and ordinary weapons. Creatures 
that fight a stone golem can feel the ebb and flow of time 
slow down around them, almost as though they were 
made of stone themselves.
