CHUUL 
Survivors of the ancient aboleth empire, chuuls are 
crustaceans the aboleths modified and endowed with 
sentience. They follow the ingrained directives of their 
creators, as they have done since the dawn of time. 
Primeval Relics. In the primeval ages, aboleths ruled 
a vast empire that spanned the oceans of the world. In 
those days, the aboleths used mighty magic and bent 
the minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm. 
However, they were bound to the water and could not 
enforce their will beyond it without servants. Therefore, 
they created chuuls. 
Perfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient 
creatures and magic at the aboleths' command. Chuuls 
were designed to endure the ages of the world, growing 
in size and strength as the eons passed. When the 
aboleths' empire crumbled with the rise of the gods, 
the chuuls were cast adrift. However, these creatures 
continue to do what they did for the aboleths, slowly 
collecting humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing 
magic, and consolidating power. 
Tireless Guardians. Chuul still guard the ruins of the 
ancient aboleth empire. They linger in silent observance 
of eons-old commands. Rumors and ancient maps 
sometimes lure treasure seekers to these ruins, but the 
reward for their boldness is death.

Sense Magic. The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at 
will. This trait otherwise works like the detect magic spell but 
isn't itself magical. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the 
chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its 
tentacles once. 
Pincer. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled 
(escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul 
doesn't have two other creatures grappled. 
Tentacles. One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on 
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. 
Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can 
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending 
the effect on itself on a success. 
Whatever riches that the explorers bring with them 
adds to the hoard guarded by the chuuls. Chuuls can 
sense magic at a distance. This sense couples with 
an innate drive that leads them to slay explorers, 
take their gear, and bury it in secret locales aboleths 
dictated eons ago. 
Waiting Servants. Although the aboleths' ancient 
empire fell long ago, the psychic bonds between them 
and their created servants remain intact. Chuuls that 
come into contact with aboleths immediately assume 
their old roles. Such chuuls redirect their compulsions 
to the service of the aboleths' sinister purposes.
