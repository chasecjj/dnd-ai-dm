Challenge 1/4 (50 XP) 
Ambusher. The kenku has advantage on attack rolls against any 
creature it has surprised. 
Mimicry. The kenku can mimic any sounds it has heard, 
including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they 
are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check. 
ACTIONS 
Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. 
Shortbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft. , 
one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. 
KENKU 
Kenku are feathered humanoids that wander the world 
as vagabonds, driven by greed. They can perfectly 
imitate any sound they hear. 
Fallen Flocks. Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, 
and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers 
of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. 
They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for 
grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the 
lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw 
attention to their shameful forms. 
Once, the kenku held the wind in their wings, 
embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language 
of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now 
lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering 
baubles of his household, and longed to speak so 
that they could cajole and swindle others out of such 
treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume 
in their master's library, they disguised themselves 
in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master 
learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as 
punishment, forcing them to beg forever. 
Speech in Pantomime. Kenku can mimic the sound 
of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might 
make the sound of coins clinking t9gether, and a 
kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce 
the cacophony of hawking vend9rs, barking dogs, 
bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When 
mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and 
phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. 
To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of 
imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse. 
Kenku speak to one another in much the same 
way. Because they are adept at interpreting one 
another's glances and gestures, the sounds they make 
to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be 
succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. 
For example, a eat's meow might be the secret code for 
"Prepare to attack!" or "Flee for your lives!" 
Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and 
criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge 
documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might 
forge evidence to implicate another creature. 
The Wistful Wingless. All kenku pine for the ability 
to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one 
another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings 
of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic 
reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry 
out executions by hurling their condemned from tall 
buildings or cliffs.
