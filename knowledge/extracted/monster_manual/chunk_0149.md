Kuo-toa are degenerate fishlike humanoids that 
once inhabited the shores and islands of the surface 
world. Long ago humans and their ilk drove the kuo-
toa underground, where they dwell in madness and 
everlasting night. Kuo-toa can no longer abide daylight. 
Mad Slaves. At the height of the illithid empire; the 
mind ftayers captured kuo-toa by the thousands and 
forced them into bondage. The kuo-toa were simple 
creatures, never meant to endure the oppressive mental 
force the illithids unleashed against them. By the 
time the mind ftayers abandoned them, the prolonged 
psychic subjugation endured by the kuo-toa had 
driven them mad. 
Their minds shattered beyond repair, the kuo-toa 
adopted a religious fervor, inventing gods to protect 
them against threats. Most notable of these threats are 
the drow, which have slain the kuo-toa on sight since the 
days when the two races first met. 
God Makers. Kuo-toa worship gods of their own 
insane creation, but if enough kuo-toa believe that a god 
is real, the energy of their collective subconscious can 
cause that god to manifest as a physical entity. The form 
a kuo-toa god takes depends on the inspiration for its 
divine image, and is usually random or nonsensical. 
One of the most revered gods of the kuo-toa is 
Blibdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, who takes the form 
of a female human with a crayfish head, a crayfish's 
claws, and an articulated she1Lc6vering her shoulders. 
Blibdoolpoolp was likely invented by a kuo-toa that 
improved on a broken human statue by adding the 
limbs and head of a crustacean. In sudden awe of its 
handiwork, it then named the resulting form a god. 
Kuo-toa that cross paths with an aboleth often find 
themselves worshiping it as a god, their madness 
blinding them to the fact that the aboleth is merely using 
them for its own nefarious ends. 
Theocratic Rulers. Kuo-toa archpriests are 
surrounded by fanatical devotees of their faith. The 
archpriest of a kuo-toa domain demands that all its 
subjects worship a specific god. An archpriest's mad 
belief in its god is so fervent that it manifests the powers 
of a high cleric. The archpriest can also bestow spells 
to devout underlings called whips. One or more of 
VARIANT: KUO·TOA MONITOR 
A kuo-toa monitor has a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP). It 
has the same statistics as a kuo-toa whip except that it adds 
its Wisdom modifier to its Armor Class (AC 13), loses the 
Spellcaster trait, and replaces the whip's action options with 
, the following action options. 
Multiattack. The kuo-toa makes one bite attack and two 
unarmed strikes. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 4 (ld4 + 2) piercing damage. 
Unarmed Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., 
one target. Hit: 5 (l d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (ld6) 
lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until 
the end of the kuo-toa's next turn.
