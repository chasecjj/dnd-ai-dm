Ethereal Stride. The nightmare and up to three willing creatures 
within 5 feet of it magically enter the Ethereal Plane from the 
Material Plane, or vice versa. 
NIGHTMARE 
A nightmare appears in a cloud of roiling smoke, its 
mane, tail, and hooves wreathed in flame. The creature's 
unearthly black form moves with supernatural speed, 
vanishing in a cloud of brimstone as quickly as 
it appeared. 
Dread Steed. Also called a "demon horse" or "hell 
horse," the nightmare serves as a steed for creatures of 
exceptional evil, carrying demons, devils, death knights, 
liches, night hags, and other vile monsters. It resembles 
a fiendish horse, and a nightmare's fiery red eyes betray 
its malevolent intelligence. 
A nightmare can be summoned from the Lower 
Planes, but unless a worthy sacrifice is offered to it as 
food upon its arrival, the nightmare displays no special 
loyalty to the creature it serves. 
Creating a Nightmare. Nightmares don't appear 
naturally in the multiverse. They must be created from 
pegasi. The ritual that creates a nightmare requires the 
torturous removal of a pegasus's wings, driving that 
noble creature to evil as it is transformed by dark magic.

Keen Sight. The nothic has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks that rely on sight. 
Multiattack. The nothic makes two claw attacks. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage. 
Rotting Gaze. The nothic targets one creature it can see 
within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 
Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) 
necrotic damage. 
Weird Insight. The nothic targets one creature it can see within 
30 feet of it. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) 
check against the nothic's Wisdom (Insight) check. If the 
nothic wins, it magically learns o ne fact o r secret about 
the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to 
being charmed. 
A baleful eye peers out from the darkness, its 
gleam hinting at a weird intelligence and unnerving 
malevolence. Most times, a nothic is content to watch, 
weighing and assessing the creatures it encounters. 
When driven to violence, it uses its horrific gaze to rot 
the flesh from its enemies' bones. 
Cursed Arcanists. Rather than gaining the godlike 
supremacy they crave, some wizards who devote 
their lives to unearthing arcane secrets are reduced 
to creeping, tormented monsters by a dark curse left 
behind by Vecna, a powerfullich who, in some worlds, 
has transcended his undead existence to become a god 
of secrets. Nothics retain no awareness of their former 
selves, skulking amid the shadows and haunting places 
rich in magical knowledge, drawn by memories and 
impulses they can't quite understand. 
Dark Oracles. Nothics possess a strange magical 
insight that allows them to extract knowledge from 
other creatures. This grants them unique understanding 
of secret and forbidden lore, which they share for a 
price. A nothic covets magic items, greedily accepting 
such gifts from creatures that seek out its knowledge. 
Lurkers in Magical Places. Nothics are notorious 
for infiltrating arcane academies and other places 
rich in magical learning. They are driven by the vague 
knowledge that there exists a method to reverse their 
condition. This isn't a clear sense of purpose, but rather 
an obsessive tug at the end of the mind. Some nothics 
are clever enough to realize that this is merely part of 
the strange lesson for their folly, a false hope to drive 
them to seek out more arcane secrets.
