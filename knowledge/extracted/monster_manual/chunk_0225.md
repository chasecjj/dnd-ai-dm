YUAN-TI 
Yuan-ti are devious serpent folk devoid of compassion. 
From remote temples in jungles, swamps, and deserts, 
the yuan-ti plot to supplant and dominate all other races 
and to make themselves gods. 
' 
Forsaken Humanity. The yuan-ti were once humans 
who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and 
worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the 
serpent's sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and 
its deadly strike. Their advanced philosophy taught 
the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear, 
focused thought. 
Yuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal 
world. Their warriors were legendary, their empires 
always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the 
centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher 
in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, 
the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant 
voices responding from the darkness as they told the 
yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew 
more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves 
to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their 
ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. 
Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, 
utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the 
serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion. 
Serpent Kings of Fallen Empires. The yuan-ti view 
their physical transformation as a transcendent moment 
for their race, allowing them to shed their frail humanity 
like dead skin. Those that did not transform eventually 
became slaves or food for the blessed of the serpent 
gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were defeated by 
those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, 
and the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great 
capitals, far removed from other races. 
Cold of Heart. Humanoid emotions are foreign to 
most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as an 
exploitable weakness. A yuan-ti views the world and 
the events of its own life with such extreme pragmatism 
that it is nearly impossible to manipulate, influence, or 
control by nonmagical means, even as it seeks to control 
other creatures through terror, pleasure, and awe. 
Yuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can't be 
bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures 
will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence 
other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. 
Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal 
mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti 
that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does 
so only as part of a grander design. 
Yuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthless tacticians 
who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory 
justifies such losses. They have no sense of honorable 
combat and strike first in decisive ambush if they can. 
False Worship. Yuan-ti life revolves around their 
temples, yet yuan-ti don't love the gods they worship. 
Instead, they see worship as a means to attain power. A 
yuan-ti believes an individual who attains enough power 
can devour and replace one of the yuan-ti gods. The 
yuan-ti strive for ascension and are willing to commit 
the darkest atrocities to achieve it.
