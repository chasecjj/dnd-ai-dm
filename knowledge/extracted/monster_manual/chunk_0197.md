Heated Body. A creature that touches the salamander or hits 
it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) 
fire damage. 
SALAMANDERS 
Heated Weapons. Any metal melee weapon the salamander 
wields deals an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage on a hit (included in 
the attack). 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The salamander makes two attacks: one with its 
spear and one with its tail. 
Spear. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. 
or range 20 ft./60ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing 
damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two 
hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage. 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. 
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire 
damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this 
grapple ends, the target is restrained, the salamander can 
automatically hit the target with its tail, and the salamander 
can't make tail attacks against other targets.

SATYR 
Satyrs are raucous fey that frolic in wild forests, driven 
by curiosity and hedonism in equal measure. 
Satyrs resemble stout male humans with the furry 
lower bodies and cloven hooves of goats. Horns sprout 
from their heads, ranging in shape from a pair of small 
nubs to large, curling rams' horns. They typically sport 
facial hair. 
Hedonistic Revelers. Satyrs crave the strongest 
drink, the most fragrant spices, and the most dizzying 
dances. A satyr feels starved when it can't indulge 
itself, and it goes to great lengths to sate its desires. It 
might kidnap a fine minstrel to hear lovely songs, sneak 
through a well-defended garden to gaze upon a beautiful 
lad or lass, or infiltrate a palace to taste the finest food in 
the land. Satyrs allow no festivity to pass them by. They 
partake in any holiday they've heard of. Civilizations of 
the world have enough festivals and holy days among 
them to justify nonstop celebration. 
Inebriated on drink and pleasure, satyrs give no 
thought to the consequences of the hedonism they incite 
in others. They leave such creatures mystified at their 
own behavior. Such revelers might have to scrounge 
for excuses to explain their disordered state to parents, 
employers, family, or friends. 
VARIANT: SATYR PIPES 
A satyr might carry panpipes that it can play to create 
magical effects. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries 
such pipes. If a satyr has pipes, it gains the following 
additional action option. 
Panpipes. The satyr plays its pipes and chooses one 
of the following magical effects: a charming melody, a 
frightening strain, or a gentle lullaby. Any creature within 60 
feet of the satyr that can hear the pipes must succeed on 
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as described 
below. Other satyrs and creatures that can't be charmed are 
unaffected. 
An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end 
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends 
for it, the creature is immune to these panpipes for the 
next 24 hours. 
Charming Melody. The creature is charmed by the satyr for 
1 minute. If the satyr or any of its companions harms the 
creature, the effect on it ends immediately. 
Frightening Strain. The creature is frightened for 1 minute. 
Gentle Lullaby. The creature falls asleep and is unconscious 
for 1 minute. The effect ends ifthe creature takes damage or 
if someone takes an action to shake the creature awake.
