APPENDIX B: NONPLAYER CHAR'ACTERS 
This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid 
nonplayer characters (NPCs) that adventurers might 
·encounter during a D&D campaign, including lowly 
commoners and mighty archmages. These stat 
blocks can be used to represent both human and 
nonhuman NPCs. 
CusTOMIZING NPCs 
There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in 
this appendix for your home campaign. 
Racial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. 
For example, a half'ling druid might have a speed of 25 
feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC 
doesn't alter its challenge rating. For more on racial 
traits, see the Player's Handbook. 
SpeJJ Swaps. One way to customize an NPC 
spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You 
can substitute any spell on the NPC's spell list with a 
different spell of the same level from the same spell list. 
Swapping spells in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's 
challenge rating. 
Armor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or 
downgrade an NPC's armor, or add or switch weapons. 
Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change 
an NPC's challenge rating, as explained in the Dungeon 
Master's Guide. 
Magic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more 
likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. 
An arch mage, for example, might have a magic staff or 
wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving 
an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter 
its challenge rating. Magic items, as well as adjusting 
.a creature's challenge rating, are described in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide.

Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) 
spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. 
Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil 
ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are 
neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote 
towers to practice their magic without interruption. 
An archmage typically has one or more apprentice 
mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical 
wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.
