TROGLODYTE 
The savage, degenerate troglodytes squat in the shallow 
depths of the Underdark in a constant state of war 
against their neighbors and one another. They mark 
the borders of their territories with cracked bones and 
skulls, or with pictographs painted in blood or dung. 
Perhaps the most loathsome of all humanoids, 
troglodytes eat anything they can stomach. They dwell 
in filth. The walls of their cavern homes are smeared 
with grime, oily secretions, and the debris of their 
foul feasting. 
Simpleminded Brutes. Troglodytes have a simple, 
communal culture devoted almost entirely to procuring 
food. Too simple to plan more than a few days into the 
future, troglodytes rely on constant raids and hunting 
to survive. They take sadistic pleasure in hunting 
TROGLODYTE 
intelligent creatures weaker than themselves and show 
no mercy toward those they capture and drag qack to 
their lairs to be devoured. The largest and toughest 
troglodytes lead the hunt and become the leaders of 
their tribes. However, if a leader shows any weakness or 
hesitation, other troglodytes attack and eat it in a frenzy. 
Troglodytes make little and build less, scavenging 
their possessions from their prey. They understand 
the value of metal weapons and armor, and fight 
among one another for the right to have such items. A 
troglodyte tribe might be torn apart by battles over a 
single longsword. 
Devotees ofLaogzed. Some troglodytes venerate 
Laogzed, a demonic, monstrously fat toad-lizard that 
slumbers in the Abyss. Laogzed offers the troglodytes 
nothing in return except aspiration, for it is the dream of 
his troglodyte worshipers to become as fat, well-fed, and 
wearily content as he seems to be.

TROLL 
Born with horrific appetites, trolls eat anything they 
can catch and devour. They have no society to speak 
of, but they do serve as mercenaries to orcs, ogres, 
ettins, hags, and giants. As payment, trolls demand food 
and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control, however, 
doing as they please even when working with more 
powerful creatures. 
Regeneration. Smashing a troll's bones and slashing 
through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll's 
wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a 
leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can 
sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can 
even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its 
momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest 
the regenerative properties of a troll's flesh. The trolls, 
enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire 
attacks against them above all other prey. 
Troll Freaks. Their regenerative capabilities make 
trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although 
uncommon, such transformations can result from 
what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A 
decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump 
of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might 
gain one or more of that creature's traits. 
VARIANT: LOATHSOME LIMBS 
Some trolls have the following trait. 
Loathsome Limbs. Whenever the troll takes at least 15 
slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what 
else happens to it: 
1-10: Nothing else happens. 
11-14: One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs left. 
15- 18: One arm is severed from the troll if it has 
any arms left. 
19-20: The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it 
can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head. 
If the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching 
a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, 
the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on 
the troll's initiative and has its own action and movement. 
1 A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's 
Regeneration trait. 
A severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet. 
A severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw 
attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless 
the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll 
loses an arm, it loses a claw attack. 
If its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its 
body is blinded unless the head can see it. The severed head 
has a speed ofO feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can 
make a bite attack but only against a target in its space. 
The troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses 
both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. 
With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. 
With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from 
bonuses to speed.
