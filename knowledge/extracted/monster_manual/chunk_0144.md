Challenge 2 (450 XP) 
Detect Sentience. The intellect devourer can sense the 
presence and location of any creature within 300 feet of it that 
has an Intelligence of 3 or higher, regardless of interposing 
barriers, unless the creature is protected by a mind blank spell. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The intellect devourer makes one attack with its 
claws and uses Devour Intellect. 
INTELLECT DEVOURER 
An intellect devourer resembles a walking brain 
protected by a crusty covering and set on bestial clawed 
legs. This foul aberration feeds on the intelligence of 
sentient creatures, taking over a victim's body on behalf 
of its mind ftayer masters. 
1/lithid Creations. Mind ftayers breed intellect 
devourers to serve as roaming hunters of the 
Underdark, creating an intellect devourer by taking the 
brain of a thrall and subjecting it to a horrible ritual. As 
it sprouts legs, the brain becomes an intelligent predator 
as twisted and evil as its masters. 
Deadly Puppet Masters. An intellect devourer 
consumes a creature's mind and memories, then turns 
the host body into a puppet under its control. An intellect 
devourer typically uses its puppet host to lure others 
into the domain of the mind flayers to be enthralled 
or consumed. 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage. 
Devour Intellect. The intellect devourer targets one creature 
it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must 
succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw against this 
magic or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a failure, 
roll3d6: If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence 
score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it 
regains at least one point of Intelligence. 
Body Thief. The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence 
contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. If 
it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes 
the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes 
control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the 
intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other 
effects originating outside its host. The intellect devourer 
retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as 
wel l as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and 
its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows 
everyth ing the creature knew, including spells and languages. 
If the host body drops to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer 
must leave it. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the 
body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer 
is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by 
means of a wish. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the 
intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to 
the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then 
dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.
