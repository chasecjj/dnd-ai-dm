Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped 
post~res, low foreheads, and piggish faces with 
prominent lower canines that resemble tusks. 
Gruumsh One-Eye. Orcs worship Gruumsh, the 
mightiest of the ore deities and their creator. The orcs 
believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide 
the world among their followers. When Gruumsh 
claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken 
by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those 
had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh 
wanted had already been claimed. The other gods 
laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious 
bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the 
mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great 
furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he 
proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races 
would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless 
war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk. 
Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god 
Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-
placed arrow to the ore god's eye. Since then, the orcs 
have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning 
his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine 
might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of 
its eyes in his honor. 
Tribes like Plagues. Orcs gather in tribes that 
exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by 
plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming 
herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against 
them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of 
wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set 
the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat 
whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied. 
Ranging Scavengers. Their lust for slaughter 
demands that orcs dwell always within striking 
distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle 
permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern 
complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified 
camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, 
making no innovation or improvement to their lairs 
beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims 
on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats 
arid trenches. 
When an existing territory is depleted of food, an ore 
tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice 
hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings 
back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the 
richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en 
masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory. 
On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold 
onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs 
of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to 
sate their appetites. 
Leadership and Might. Ore tribes are mostly 
patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles 
as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. 
Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered 
ore tribes into a single rampaging horde, which 
runs roughshod over other ore tribes and humanoid 
settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.
