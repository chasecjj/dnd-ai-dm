forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every 
sound seems muffled. 
At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses 
a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring 
an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out 
cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly 
submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes 
or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs 
with vegetation. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; 
the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
• Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius 
centered on a point on the ground that the dragon 
can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes dif-
ficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed 
on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained 
by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it 
or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 
Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines 
wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again 
or when the dragon dies. 
A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs 
into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the 
dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, 
and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the 
wall appears, each creature in its area must make a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the 
save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 
feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever 
side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through 
the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a 
creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet 
of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's 
space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw 
once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 
18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot sec-
tion of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to 
fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing 
damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall 
sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this 
lair action again or when the dragon dies. 
• Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon 
can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must 
succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be 
charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on 
the next round. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair 
is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one 
or more of the following effects: 
• Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 
1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets 
act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls 
that block line of sight. Creatures 
can move through the thickets, 
with every 1 foot a creature 
moves costing it 4 feet of 
15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in con-
tact with the 'thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage 
from thorns. 
Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit 
points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing dam-
age, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to 
psychic and thunder damage. 
• Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical 
evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it 
there is impossible except by magical means. In addi-
tion, it ignores movement impediments and damage 
from plants in this area that are neither magical nor 
creatures, including the thickets described above. The 
plants remove themselves from the dragon's path. 
• Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair 
serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other 
large game are strangely absent, hinting at the pres-
ence of an unnaturally hungry predator. 
If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their 
supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 
1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal 
difficult terrain, losing their thorns.
