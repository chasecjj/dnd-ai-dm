One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, 
lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid 
into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a 
creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal 
self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire 
, features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal 
form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of 
a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a 
faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red 
in the dark. 
Evillycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging 
in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, 
especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are 
reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized 
creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far 
from villages and towns. 
Curse of Lycanthropy. A humanoid creature can 
be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being 
wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its 
parents are lycanthropes. A remove curse spell can rid 
an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born 
lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish. 
A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace 
it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its 
normal alignment and personality while in humanoid 
form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the 
bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full 
moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, 
transforming the individual into its beast form-or 
into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and 
humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast 
within can be controlled once again. Especially if the 
cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not 
remember the events of its transformation, though those 
memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams. 
Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse 
and accept what they are. With time and experience, 
they learn to master their shapechanging ability and 
can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most 
lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures 
succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic 
creatures that prey on the weak. 
WEREBEAR 
Werebears are powerfullycanthropes with the ability to 
temper their monstrous natures and reject their violent 
impulses. In humanoid form, they are large, muscular, 
and covered in hair matching the color of their ursine 
form's fur. A were bear is a loner by nature, fearing what 
might happen to innocent creatures around it when its 
bestial nature takes over. 
VARIANT: NONHUMAN LYCANTHROPES 
The statistics presented in this section assume a base 
creature of human. However, you can also use the statistics 
to represent nonhuman lycanthropes, adding verisimilitude 
by allowing a nonhuman lycanthrope to retain one or more of 
its humanoid racial traits. For example, an elf werewolf might 
have the Fey Ancestry trait.

When a werebear transforms, it grows to enormous 
size, lashing out with weapons or claws. It fights with 
the ferocity of a bear, though even in its bestial forms, 
it avoids biting so as to not pass on its curse. Typically, 
a were bear passes on its lycanthropy only to chosen 
companions or apprentices, spending the time that 
follows helping the new lycanthrope accept the curse in 
order to control it. 
Solitary creatures, werebears act as wardens over 
their territory, protecting flora and fauna alike from 
humanoid or monstrous intrusion. Though most 
were bears are of good alignment, some are every bit as 
evil as other lycanthropes. 
WEREBOAR 
Wereboars are ill-tempered and vulgar brutes. As 
humanoids, they are stocky and muscular, with short, 
stiff hair. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, they use 
heavy weapons, while in hybrid or animal form, they 
gain a devastating goring attack through which their 
curse is spread. A wereboar infects other creatures 
indiscriminately, relishing the fact that the more its 
victims resist the curse, the more savage and bestial 
they become. 
Wereboars live in small family groups in remote forest 
areas, building ramshackle huts or dwelling in caves. 
They are suspicious of strangers but sometimes ally 
themselves with orcs. 
WERERAT 
Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious 
personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid 
form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid 
and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use 
ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although 
a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors 
that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather 
than combat. 
A wererat clan operates much like a thieves' guild, 
with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures 
they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are 
accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan's 
control are quickly hunted down and killed. 
Wererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, 
often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These 
creatures are common in the sewers beneath major 
cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their 
hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly 
found living among wererats. 
WERETIGER 
Weretigers are ferocious hunters and warriors with 
a haughty and fastidious nature. Lithe and sleekly 
muscular in humanoid form, they are taller than 
average and meticulously groomed. Weretigers grow to 
enormous size in animal and hybrid form, but they fight 
in their more refined humanoid form when they can. 
They don't like to pass on their curse, because every 
new were tiger means competition for territory and prey. 
Weretigers live in jungles on the fringes of humanoid 
civilization, traveling to isolated settlements to trade or 
revel. They live and hunt alone or in small family groups. 
WEREWOLF 
A werewolf is a savage predator. In its humanoid form, 
a werewolf has heightened senses, a fiery temper, and 
a tenqency to eat rare meat. Its wolf form is a fears9me 
predator, but its hybrid form is more terrifying by far-a 
furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a 
ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in 
hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its 
powerful claws and bite. 
Most werewolves flee civilized lands not long after 
becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear 
what will happen if they remain among their friends and 
family. Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and 
the consequences of their murderous acts. In the wild, 
werewolves form packs that also include wolves and 
dire wolves.
