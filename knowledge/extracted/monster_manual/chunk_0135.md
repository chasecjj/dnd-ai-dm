Innate Spellcasting. The hag's innate spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). She 
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material 
components: 
At will: detect magic, magic missile 
2jday each: plane shift (self only), ray of enfeeblement, sleep 
NIGHT HAG 
Sly and subversive, night hags want to see the virtuous 
turn to villainy: love turned into obsession, kindness 
turned to hate, devotion to disregard, and generosity 
to selfishness. Night hags take perverse joy in 
corrupting mortals. 
Night hags were once creatures of the Feywild, but 
their foulness saw them exiled to Hades long ago, where 
they degenerated into fiends. The night hags have long 
since spread across the Lower Planes. 
Sou/mongers. While a humanoid sleeps, a night hag 
can straddle the person ethereally and intrude upon its 
dreams. Any creature with truesight can see the hag's 
spectral form straddling its prey. The ethereal hag fills 
her victim's head with doubts and fears, in the hope of 
tricking it into performing evil acts in the waking world. 
The hag continues her nightly visitations until the victim 
finally expires in its sleep. If the hag has driven her 
victim to commit evil deeds, she traps its corrupted soul 
in her soul bag (see the "Night Hag Items" sidebar) for 
transport to Hades. 
Covens. A night hag that is part of a coven (see 
the "Hag Covens" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 
7 (2,900 XP). 
Magic Resistance. The hag has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Claws (Hag Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 
5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage. 
Change Shape. The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or 
Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her 
statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is 
wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true 
form if she dies. 
Etherealness. The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from 
the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a 
heartstone in her possession. 
Nightmare Haunting (1/Day). While on the Ethereal Plane, the 
hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material 
Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target 
prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the 
contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions 
last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, 
and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect 
reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, 
and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul 
bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until 
removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
