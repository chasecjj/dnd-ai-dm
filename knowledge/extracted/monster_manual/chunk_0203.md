Multiattack. The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite 
and two with its claws. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. , one target. 
Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. , one target. 
Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, 
it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be 
infected with a disease- a minuscule slaad egg. 
A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a 
time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, 
gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period 
before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is 
halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, 
and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through 
vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the 
host in the process. 
If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the 
unborn slaad is disintegrated.

Magic Resistance. The slaad has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Regeneration. The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its 
turn if it has at least 1 hit point. 
A CTI O NS 
Multiattack. The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite 
and two with its claws. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, 
it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be 
infected with a disease called chaos phage. While infected, 
the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is 
reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the 
target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms 
into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd 
level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the 
transformation.
