WHITE DRAGON 
The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of 
the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid 
climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are 
• vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed. 
A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a 
spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon 
glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen 
disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, 
so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches 
of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the 
dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which 
it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a 
cloud-filled sky. 
Primal and Vengeful. White dragons lack the 
cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, 
their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among 
all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and 
· slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes 
only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures 
killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and 
frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in 
snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good 
indication that a white dragon dwells nearby. 
A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest 
enerriies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can 
look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, 
remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned 
prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings 
to intruders. 
Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons 
' have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight 
and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious 
ve~dettas against creatures that have offended them. 
This often includes silver dragons, which lair in

Lone Masters. White dragons avoid all other dragons 
except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when 
white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay 
together only long enough to conceive offspring b~fore 
fleeing into isolation again. 
White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a 
result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without 
provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak 
or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically 
serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that 
demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's 
wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as 
a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping 
kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs. 
Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white 
dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical 
or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons 
to prove their own strength and improve their status 
in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a 
white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated 
by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the 
mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting 
its own domination over the other creatures that serve 
or oppose the giant. 
Treasure Under Ice. White dragons love the cold 
sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, 
particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic 
climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often 
contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone 
sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic 
items seized from overly bold adventurers. 
Loose coins and gems are spread across a white 
dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes 
them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers 
of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held 
safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's 
great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while 
lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or 
melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard. 
A white dragon's flawless memory means that it 
knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and 
magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with 
a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult 
to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an 
insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making 
the offer and seize the treasure on their own. 
A WHITE DRAGON'S LAIR 
White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean 
chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain 
vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and 
labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love 
vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling 
to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses. 
A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens 
the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns 
are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A 
white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the 
keening wind in its lair changes tone.
