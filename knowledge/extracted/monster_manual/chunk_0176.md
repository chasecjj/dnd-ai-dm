OGRES 
Ogres are as lazy of mind as they are strong of bodY,. 
They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and 
pleasure. The average adult specimen stands b~tween 9 
and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand povnds. 
Furious Tempers. Ogres are notorious for their quick 
tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. 
Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wr-ath in 
an instant- as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or 
prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at 
it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes 
out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or 
creatures to smash. 
Gruesome Gluttons. Ogres eat almost anything, but 
they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, hal flings, 
and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with 
pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before 
eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains 
after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a 
loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its 
leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of 
ogre culture. 
Greedy Collectors. An ogre's eyes glitter with 
avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres 
carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with 
fabulous "treasure" taken from their victims. This might 
include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel 
of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a 
cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also 
delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will 
fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter 
creatures can earn an ogre's trust by offering it gold or a 
weapon forged for a creature of its size. 
Legendary Stupidity. Few ogres can count to ten, 
even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only 
a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of 
Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and 
are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they 
don't understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test 
their talents on these savages typically end up eating 
their eloquent words-and then being eaten in turn. 
Primitive Wanderers. Ogres clothe themselves in 
animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools 
and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for 
hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near 
the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of 
poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and 
unwary farmers. 
An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees 
until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon 
it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is 
bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, 
attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an. 
ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.
