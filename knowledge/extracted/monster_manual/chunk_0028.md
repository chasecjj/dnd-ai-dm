Fiendish Blessing. The AC of the cambion includes its 
Charisma bonus. 
Innate Spellcasting. The cambion's spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 14). The cambion can innately cast the 
following spells, requiring no material components: 
OAMBION 
CAMBION 
,.THEY CRAWL FROM THEIR MOTHERS' 
WOMBS TO Sr>REAO CORRUr>T ION 
THROUGHOUT THE MULTIVER SE. 
WHAT's NOT TO LOVE?" 
A cambion is the offspring of a fiend (usually a succubus 
or incubus) and a humanoid (usually a human). 
Cambions inherit aspects of both parents, but their 
horns, leathery wings, and sinewy tails are hallmarks of 
their otherworldly parentage. 
Born to Be Bad. Cambions grow into ruthless adults 
whose wickedness and perversion horrifies even the 
most devoted mortal parent. Even as a youth, a cambion 
identifies its rightful place as an overlord of mortals. It 
might orchestrate uprisings in towns and cities, gathering 
gangs of humanoids and lesser devils to serve it. 
Pawns of the Mighty. A cambion forced to serve its 
fiendish parent does so out of admiration and dread, but 
also with the expectation that it will one day rise to a 
place of prominence. Cambions raised in the Nine Hells 
serve as soldiers, envoys, and personal attendants to 
greater devils. In the Abyss, a cambion carries only as 
much authority as it can muster through sheer strength 
and force of will. 
Spawn ofGraz'zt. The demon lord Graz'zt is fond of 
procreating with humanoids who have made pacts with 
fiends, and he has sired many cambions who help him 
sow chaos across the multiverse. These cambions are 
characterized by charcoal-black skin, cloven hooves, six-
fingered hands, and unearthly beauty. 
3fday each: alter self, command, detect magic 
1fday: plane shift (self only) 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The cambion makes two melee attacks or uses its 
Fire Ray twice. 
Spear. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or 
range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 
8 (1 d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a 
melee attack, plus 3 (1 d6) fire damage. 
Fire Ray. Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 120ft., one 
target. Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage. 
Fiendish Charm. One humanoid the cambion can see within 
30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or 
be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the 
cambion's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm 
from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal 
command from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving 
throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's 
saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the 
creature is immune to the cambion's Fiendish Charm for the 
next 24 hours.
