HELLHOUND 
Monstrous, fire-breathing fiends that take the form of 
powerful dogs, hell hounds are found on the battlefields 
of Acheron and throughout the Lower Planes. On the 
Material Plane, hell hounds are most commonly seen 
in service to devils, fire giants, and other evil creatures 
that use them as guard animals and companions. 
Burning Hunger. Hell hounds hunt in packs, feeding 
on any creature that appears edible. They avoid 
potentially dangerous foes in favor of targeting the 
weakest prey with their savage bite and fiery breath, 
demonstrating a relentless determination as they pursue 
that prey to the bitter end. 
When hell hounds feed, the flesh they consume stokes 
the infernal fires that burn within them. When a hell 
hound dies, that fire consumes the creature's remains 
in a billowing eruption of smoke and blazing embers, 
leaving nothing behind but scorched tufts of black fur. 
Evil to the Core. Hell hounds are smarter than 
mundane beasts, and their lawful nature makes them 
good at following orders. However, a hell hound's evil 
disposition means that the creature can't be trained to 
be anything other than a ruthless killer. If a hell hound 
isn't allowed to indulge its malevolent hunger, it quickly 
abandons or turns against its master.

HELMED HORROR 
This construct possesses intelligence, the ability 
to reason and adjust its tactics, and an unswerving 
devotion to its maker that persists even after its 
maker's demise. Resembling an animated suit of 
empty plate armor, a helmed horror serves without 
ambition or emotion. 
Magical Purpose. Though it takes more magical 
resources to create a helmed horror than a lesser 
suit of animated armor, the helmed horror requires 
less direction and maintenance as it carries out its 
appointed tasks. A helmed horror follows its orders 
with complete loyalty, and is intelligent enough to 
understand the difference between an order's intent and 
its exact wording. Unlike many constructs, it seeks to 
fulfill the former rather than slavishly follow the latter. 
Tactical Cunning. A helmed horror fights with 
the cunning of a skilled warrior, taking to the air as 
it attacks weaker characters and spellcasters first. 
However, a helmed horror lacks the insight to change 
its environment, fortify it, or otherwise take active 
measures to improve its defensive position. 
Constructed Nature. A helmed horror doesn't 
require air, food, drink, or sleep.
