SLAADI 
In the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, bits of forest 
and meadow, ruined castles, and isolated islands drift 
thq:mgh a tumult of fire, water, earth, and wind. The 
' foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the 
toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no 
formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger 
ones under threat of annihilation. 
The Spawning Stone. Long ago, Primus, overlord of 
the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex 
stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it 
adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring 
order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread 
of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, 
it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, 
such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in 
Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen 
side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone 
spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. 
Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the 
Spawning Stone for this reason. 
The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave 
in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe 
modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus 
stands by his creation and either doesn't perceive the 
slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them. 
Birth and Transformation. Slaadi have horrific 
cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by 
implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting 
them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. 
Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a 
different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green 
slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each 
'green. slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation 
into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each 
transformation, the slaad retains its memories. 
Shapechangers. Some slaadi can transform into the 
humanoid creatures from which they were originally 
spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to 
sow discord in the guise of their former selves. 
RED SLAAD 
When a red slaad claws a humanoid creature, it can 
inject an egg from a gland under one of its claws. The 
egg works its way into its host and gestates, eventually 
forming a slaad tadpole. Such a tadpole then eats its way 
out of the host's body, feeds on the host's remains, and 
then seeks any other fresh meat it can find. The tadpole 
transforms into a fully grown blue slaad- or green 
slaad if the host had the ability to cast 3rd level spells or 
higher- within 2d12 hours. 
BLUE SLAAD 
The bone hooks that protrude from the back of a blue 
slaad's hands inflict a terrible transformative disease 
on humanoids wounded by them. This infection, called 
chaos phage, transforms its victim into a fully grown red 
slaad- or green slaad if the host was a spellcaster able 
to cast 3rd level spells or higher. 
Green slaadi. a~e surprisingly intelligent and possess 
innate spellcasting ability. A green slaad can change 
its shape to appear as a humanoid. If it was born of a 
humanoid host, the slaad usually adopts its host's form. 
At some unpredictable point in its existence, a 
green slaad unlocks the means to magically, instantly, 
and permanently transform itself into a gray slaad. 
Unlocking this knowledge can take years, even decades. 
GRAY SLAAD 
Outside of Limbo, gray slaadi act as living extensions of 
the will of their masters, the death slaadi. A gray slaad 
journeys to the Material Plane on errands of doom, 
often taking humanoid form. A gray slaad learns how 
to master the use of a greatsword and imbue it with its 
own innate magic. 
A gray slaad that eats the entire corpse of a dead 
death slaad instantly transforms into a death slaad. 
DEATH SLAAD 
Death slaadi are suffused with energy from the Negative 
Energy Plane and exemplify evil's corruption of chaos, 
and they take sadistic pleasure in bringing harm 
to others. They propagate their race by dragooning 
mobs of red and blue slaadi and invading other 
planes. Humanoids who survive the incursion become 
incubators for new slaadi. 
VARIANT: SLAAD CONTROL GEMS 
As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone 
magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad's brain. 
This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size 
and shape of a human child's fist. The gem is the same color 
as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth 
a slaad's gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The slaad 
must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad's gem is 
destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way. 
A slaad born from something other than the Spawning 
Stone has no gem in its brain, but it gains one if it ever 
comes into contact with the Spawning Stone. Slaadi on 
Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so most end up 
with a gem. A slaad with a control gem in its brain has the 
following additional trait. 
Control Gem. Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic 
control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the 
gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled. 
Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad 
fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can 
transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead 
of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's 
presence, can be worded to acquire the gem. 
A greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the 
gem without harming the slaad. 
Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can 
remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try 
requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 
20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 
(4dl0) psychic damage to the slaad.
