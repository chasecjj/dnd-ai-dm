CARRION CRAWLER 
Carrion crawlers scour putrid flesh from carcasses and 
gobble the slimy bQnes that remain. They aggressively 
attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or 
disturbs their feasting. 
Carrion Eaters. A carrion crawler follows the 
scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete 
with other scavengers. These foul creatures thus 
hunker down in territories where death is plentiful 
and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, 
sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their 
favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to 
battlefields and cemeteries. 
A carrion crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles 
probing the air for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels 
or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as 
they move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact 
with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants 
of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals 
that don't think to look up. 
Patient Predators. Whether in subterranean 
darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a 
potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light 
source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the 
scent of blood. Despite their great size, carrion crawlers 
can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind 
corners for prey to come to them. 
When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion 
crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes 
rigiq wit~ paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with 
its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated 
passageway, where it can be killed safely. The monster 
then resumes patrolling its territory while waiting for its 
meal to ripen~

CENTAUR 
Reclusive wanderers and omen-readers of the wild, 
centaurs avoid conflict but fight fiercely when pressed. 
They roam the vast wilderness, keeping far from 
borders, laws, and the company of other creatures. 
Wilderness Nomads. Centaur tribes range across 
lands with mild to hot climates, where a centaur 
requires only light furs or oiled skins to deal with 
inclement weather. They are hunter-gatherers and rarely 
build shelters or even use tents. 
Centaur migrations span continents and take decades 
to repeat, so that a centaur tribe might not retread 
the same path for generations. These long-ranging 
patterns can lead to conflict when centaurs encounter 
settlements of other creatures built along their 
traditional routes. 
Reluctant Settlers. A centaur that can't keep pace 
with the rest of its tribe is left behind. Some such 
centaurs vanish into the wilderness and are never 
seen again. Those that can bear the loss of their tribe 
might take up residence among other races. Frontier 
settlements value the nature knowledge of their centaur 
residents. Many such communities owe their survival to 
the insight and acumen of a centaur. 
Despite their reclusive nature, centaurs trade with 
elves and with the caravans of other benevolent 
humanoids they meet during their wanderings. A trader 
might save the life of a wounded or an elderly centaur 
unfit for long travel, escorting it to a settlement where it 
can peacefully live out the rest of its days.
