HILL GIANT 
Hill giants are selfish, dimwitted brutes that hunt 
forage, and raid in constant search of food. They blunder 
through hills and forests devouring what they can, 
' bullying smaller creatures into feeding them. Their 
laziness and dullness would long ago have spelled their 
end if not for their formidable size and strength. 
Primitive. Hill giants dwell in hills and mountain 
valleys across the world, congregating in steadings built 
of rough timber or in clusters of well-defended mud-
and-wattle huts. Their skins are tan from lives spent 
lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing 
beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and 
rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies 
adds to the reek of the crude animal skins they wear, 
poorly stitched together with hair and leather thongs. 
Bigger Means Better. In a hill giant's world, 
humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be 
hunted with impunity. Creatures such as dragons and 
other giants are tough adversaries. Hill giants equate 
size with power. 
Hill giants don't realize they follow an ordning. They 
know only that other giants are larger and stronger than 
they are, which means they are to be obeyed. A hill giant 
tribe's chief is usually the tallest and fattest giant that 
can still move about. Only on rare occasion does a hill 
giant with more brains than bulk use its cunning to gain 
the favor of giants of higher status, cleverly subverting 
the social order. 
Voracious Eaters. With nothing else to occupy them, 
hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts and 
forages alone or with a dire wolf companion, so as to not 
have to share with other tribe members. The giant eats 
anything that isn't obviously deadly, such as creatures 
known to be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, 
though, as are decaying plants and even mud. 
Farmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator 
such as an ankheg might burrow through fields and 
consume a cow or two before being driven off, a hill 
giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before moving 
on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits, 
vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand, the 
giant might snack on them too. 
Stupid and Deadly. The hill giants' ability to digest 
nearly anything has allowed them to survive for eons as 
savages, eating and breeding in the hills like animals. 
They have never needed to adapt and change, so their 
minds and emotions remain simple and undeveloped. 
With no culture of their own, hill giants ape the 
traditions of creatures they manage to observe for 
a time before eating them. They don't think about 
their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill 
giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to 
topple entire forests by trying to live in trees. Others 
attempting to take over humanoid towns or villages 
get only as far as the doors and windows of a building, 
taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter. 
In conversation, hill giants are blunt and direct, and 
they have little concept of deception. A hill giant might 
be fooled into running from another giant if a number of 
villagers cover themselves in blankets and stand on one

another's sllo}llaers holding a giant-paint€d pumpkin 
head. Reasonip.g with a hill giant is futile, although 
clever creatures can sometimes encourage a giant to 
take actions that benefit them. 
Raging Bullies. A hill giant that feels as though it 
has been deceived, insulted, or made into a fool vents 
its terrible wrath on anything it encounters. Even after 
smashing those who offended it into pulp, the giant 
rampages until its rage abates, it notices something 
more interesting, or it grows hungry. 
If a hill giant proclaims itself king over a territory 
where other humanoids live, it rules strictly by terror 
and tyranny. Its decisions shift with its mood, and if it 
forgets the title it bestowed upon itself, it might eat its 
subjects on a whim. 
STONE GIANT 
Stone giants are reclusive, quiet, and peaceful as long 
as they are left alone. Their granite-gray skin, gaunt 
features, and black, sunken eyes endow stone giants 
with a stern countenance. They are private creatures, 
hiding their lives and art away from the world. 
Inhabitants of a Stone World. Secluded caves are 
the homes of the stone giants. Cavern networks are 
their towns, rocky tunnels their roads, and underground 
streams their waterways. Isolated mountain ranges are 
their continents, with the vast spans of land between 
seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross. 
In their dark, quiet caves, stone giants wordlessly 
chip away at elaborate carvings, measuring time in 
the echoing drip of water into cavern pools. In the 
deepest chambers of a stone giant settlement, far from 
the chittering of bats or the patrols paced out by the 
giants' cave bear companions, are holy places where 
silence and darkness are complete. Stone takes on its 
most sacred quality in these cavern cathedrals, their 
buttresses and columns carved with a beauty that 
shames the legendary stonecraft of the dwarves. 
Carvers and Seers. Among stone giants, artistry 
ranks as the greatest virtue. They create intricate 
murals, paint sprawling murals across cavern walls, and 
indulge in a wide variety of other artistic disciplines. 
They esteem stone carving as the greatest of skills. 
· Stone giants strive to draw shapes out of raw stone, 
which they believe reveal meaning inspired by their god, 
Skoraeus Stonebones. The giants appoint the tribe's 
best carvers as their leaders, shamans, and prophets. 
The holy hands of such giants become the hands of the 
god as they work. 
Graceful Athletes. Despite their great size and 
musculature, stone giants are lithe and graceful. Skilled 
rock throwers are granted positions of high rank in the 
giants' ordning, testing and demonstrating their ability 
to hurl and catch enormous boulders. Such giants take 
the front ranks when a tribe has cause to defend its 
home or attack its enemies. However, even in combat, 
artistry is key. A stone giant hurling a rock performs 
not just a feat of brute strength but also one of stunning 
athleticism and poise. 
Dreamers under Sky. Stone giants view the world 
outside their underground homes as a realm of dreams 
where nothing is entirely true or real. They behave in
