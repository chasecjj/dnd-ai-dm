Magic Resistance. The nalfeshnee has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The nalfeshnee uses Horror Nimbus if it can. 
It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with 
its claws. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 32 (5d10 + 5) piercing damage. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage. 
Horror Nimbus (Recharge 5-6). The nalfeshnee magically 
emits scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature within 15 
feet of the nalfeshnee that can see the light must succeed on 
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A 
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's 
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the 
creature is immune to the nalfeshnee's Horror Nimbus for the 
next 24 hours.

any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an 
unoccupied space it can see.

VARIANT: QUASIT fAMILIAR 
Mortal spellcasters interested in extraplanar familiars find 
quasits easy to summon and eager to serve. The quasit plays 
the part of the obsequious servant. It serves its master well, 
but it goads the mortal to greater and greater acts of chaos 
and evil. Such quasits have the following trait. 
Familiar. The quasit can serve another creature as a 
familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master. 
While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the 
quasit senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. 
While the quasit is within 10 feet of its master, the master 
shares the quasit's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and 
for any reason, the qua sit can end its service as a familiar, 
ending the telepathic bond.

centipede (40ft., climb 40ft.), or a toad (40ft., swi m 40ft.), 
or back into its true form . Its statistics are the same in each

feet of it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be 
frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw

within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
Invisibility. The quasit magically turns invisible until it 
attacks or uses Scare, or until its concentration ends (as if 
concentrating on a spel l). Any equipment the quasit wears or 
carries is invisible with it.
