· A grinning, mischievous magmin resembles a stumpy 
humanoid sculpted from a black shell of magma. Even 
when it isn't ablaze and radiating heat like a bonfire, 
small jets of flame erupt from its porous skin. 
Summoned Pyromaniacs. Magmins are fire 
elemental spirits bound into physical forms by magic, 
and they appear in the Material Plane only when 
summoned. They view flammable objects as kindling 
for a grand conflagration, and only the magical control 
,. exerted by their summoners keeps them from setting 
everything they touch ablaze. Their propensity for fire 
and havoc makes them ideal for spreading chaos and 
'. destruction. A mob of magmins summoned inside a 
';c~~tle can reduce it to a burning shell within minutes. 
Fiery Destruction. Although its flame is potent, the 
magmin's hard magma shell prevents it from instantly 
igniting everything it comes into contact with. However, 
like the fires inside them, magmins are capricious and 
unpredictable. Moreover, as simple elemental creations, 
they are oblivious to the harm their native element 
causes creatures of the Material Plane. 
If it has the opportunity while in service to its master, 
a magmin seeks out areas of great heat, such as forest 
fires or the bubbling magma of an active volcano. At 
other times, a magmin compulsively looses fire from its 
fingertip§, delighting in setting objects.ablaze.

MANTIC ORE 
A monster in every sense of the word, a manticore has 
a vaguely humanoid head, the body of a lion, and the 
wings of a dragon. A bristling mane stretches down 
the creature's back, and its long tail ends in a cluster of 
deadly spikes that can impale prey at impressive range. 
Evil Predators. Manticores are fierce killers that hunt 
far and wide for prey. They work together to take down 
particularly large or dangerous creatures, sharing the 
meal once a kill is made. A manticore begins its attack 
with a volley of tail spikes, then lands and uses its claws 
and bite. When outdoors and outnumbered, it uses its 
wings to stay aloft, attacking from a distance until its 
spikes are depleted. 
A manticore isn't particularly bright, but it possesses 
a malevolent nature and the ability to converse. In the 
course of attacking, it denigrates its foes and offers to 
kill them swiftly if they beg for their lives. If a manti core 
sees an advantage to be gained by sparing a creature's 
life, it does so, asking for a tribute or sacrifice equal to 
its loss of food. 
Monstrous Relationships. Manticores serve wicked 
masters that treat them well and provide regular prey. A 
manticore might provide aerial support for an ore horde 
or a hobgoblin army. Another could serve as a hunting 
companion for a hill giant chief, or guard the entrance to 
a lamia's lair. 
The manticores' greatest territorial rivals include 
chimeras, griffons, perytons, and wyverns. Manticores 
hunting as a pack often have the advantage of greater~: 
numbers. In addition to these creatures, manticores fear; 
dragons and avoid them.
