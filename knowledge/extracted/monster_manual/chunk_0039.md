Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons 
are the embodiment of chaos and evil- engines of 
destruction barely contained in monstrous form. 
Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they 
exist only to destroy. 
Spawn of Chaos. The Abyss creates demons as 
extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of 
filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while 
others represent uniform strains virtually identical to 
each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created 
from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or 
which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss. 
Capricious Elevation. Demons respect power and 
power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking 
mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser 
demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon's 
status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies 
that fall before it, the greater it becomes. 
A demon might spawn as a manes, then become 
a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after 
untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. 
Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons 
are destroyed before they attain significant power. The 
greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of 
the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart 
with their endless warring. 
By expending considerable magical power, demon 
lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though 
such promotions never stem from a demon's deeds or 
accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a 
manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or 
turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching 
against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate 
demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently 
creating rivals to their own power. 
Abyssal Invasions. Wherever they wander across the 
Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. 
They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm 
and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, 
undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, 
and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin . 
. Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are 
built around the destruction wrought by demons set 
loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled 
in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help 
contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal 
breaches before these fiends can break free. 
Signs of Corruption. Demons carry the stain of 
abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence 
changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die 
in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. 
Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a 
kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled 
by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or 
burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the 
places where these fiends lingered. 
Eternal Evil. Outside the Abyss, death is a minor 
nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can't 
stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to 
the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero
