OWLBEAR 
An owlbear's screech echoes through dark valleys and 
benighted forests, piercing the quiet night to announce 
the death of its prey. Feathers cover the thick, shaggy 
coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its 
great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head. 
Deadly Ferocity. The owlbear's reputation for ferocity, 
aggression, stubbornnes~. and sheer ill temper makes 
it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There 
is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even 
monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength 
avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing 
about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without 
provocation. 
Consummate Predators. An owl bear emerges 
from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest 
hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its 
territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its 
hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar 
to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's 
escape routes. 
An owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered 
with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured 
kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass 
among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. 
The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy 
near an owlbear's lair, attracting scavengers and thus 
luring more prey. 
Owl bears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is 
plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together 
for longer than 'is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, 
they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt. 
Savage Companions. Although they are more 
intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to 
tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an 
intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it 
as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and 
hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have 
even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as 
often on which owl bear will attack its handler as they do 
on which will reach the finish line first. 
Elven communities encourage owlbears to den 
beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a 
natural defense during the night. Hobgoblins favor 
owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost 
giants sometimes keep owl bears as pets. A starved 
owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, 
ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a 
bloodthirsty audience. 
Ow/bear Origins. Scholars have long debated the 
origins of the owl bear. The most common theory is 
that a demented wizard created the first specimen by 
crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable 
elves claim to have known these creatures for thousands 
of years, and some fey insist that owl bears have always 
existed in the Feywild.
