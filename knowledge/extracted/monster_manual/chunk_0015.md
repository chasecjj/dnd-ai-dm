ANKHEG 
An ankheg resembles an enormous many-legged 
insect, its long antennae twitching in response to any 
movement around it. Its legs end in sharp hooks adapted 
for burrowing and grasping its prey, and its powerful 
mandibles can snap a small tree in half. 
Lurkers in the Earth. The ankheg uses its powerful 
mandibles to dig winding tunnels deep beneath the 
ground. When it hunts, an ankheg burrows upward, 
waiting below the surface until its antennae detect 
movement from above. Then it bursts from the earth 
and. seizes prey in its mandibles, crushing and grinding 
while it secretes acidic digestive enzymes. These 
enzymes help dissolve a victim for easy swallowing, but 
the ankheg can also squirt acid to take down foes. 
Bane of Field and Forest. Although ankhegs receive 
a certain portion of their nutrients from the soil through 
which they burrow, they must supplement their diet with 
fresh meat. Pastures teeming with grazing livestock and 
forests rife with game are an ankheg's prime hunting 
gro~nds. Ankhegs are thus the bane of farmers and 
rangers everywhere. 
Earthen Tunnels. As it burrows through earth, the 
ankheg leaves a narrow, partially collapsed tunnel in its 
wake. In these tunnels, one might find the remnants of 
molted ankheg chitin, hatched ankheg eggs, or the grisly 
remains of ankheg victims, including coins or other 
treasures scattered during the creature's attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 9 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage. If 
the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape 
DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can bite only the 
grappled creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so. 
Acid Spray (Recharge 6). The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 
30 feet long and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature 
grappled. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
