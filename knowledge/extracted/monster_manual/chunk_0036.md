Echolocation. The darkmantle can't use its blindsight 
while deafened. 
CHA 
5 (- 3) 
False Appearance. While the darkmantle remains motionless, it 
is indistinguishable from a cave formation such as a stalactite 
or stalagmite. 
A darkmantle clings to cavern ceilings, remaining 
perfectly still as it waits for creatures to pass beneath 
it. From a distance, it can pass itself off as a stalactite 
or a lump of stone. Then it drops from the ceiling and 
unfurls, surrounding itself with magical darkness as it 
engulfs and crushes its prey. 
Darkmantles are found throughout the Underdark, but 
they are equally common on the Shadowfell. Thriving in 
that dark realm, they fill an ecological niche similar to 
bats on the Material Plane. Intelligent creatures of the 
Shadowfell sometimes train darkmantles as guardians 
or companions. 
ACTIONS 
Crush. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
Hit: 6 (ld6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle 
attaches to the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and 
the darkmantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by 
engulfing the target's head, and the target is also blinded and 
unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way. 
While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no 
other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack 
rolls. The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit 
from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target. 
A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successfu l 
DC l3 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle 
can detach itselffrom the target by using 5 feet of movement. 
Darkness Aura (1/Day). A 15-foot radius of magical darkness 
extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads 
around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle 
maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating 
on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no 
natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps 
with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the 
spell creating the light is dispelled.

DEATH K 'NIGHT 
When a paladin that falls from gFace dies without 
seeking atonement, dark powers can transform the 
once-mortal knight into a hateful undead creature. A 
death knight is a skeletal warrior clad in fearsome plate 
armor. Beneath its helmet, one can see the knight's 
skull with malevolent pinpoints of light burning in its 
eye sockets. 
Eldritch Power. The death knight retains the ability 
to cast divine spells. However, no death knight can 
use its magic to heal. A death knight also attracts and 
commands lesser undead, although death knights that 
serve powerful fiends might have fiendish followers 
instead. Death knights often use warhorse skeletons 
and nightmares as mounts. 
Immortal Until Redeemed. A death knight can arise 
anew even after it has been destroyed. Only when it 
atones for a life of wickedness or finds redemption can it 
finally escape its undead purgatory and truly perish. 
LORD SOTH 
Lord Soth began his fall from grace with an act of heroism, 
saving an elf named Isolde from an ogre. Soth and Isolde 
fell in love, but Soth was already married. He had a servant 
dispose of his wife and was charged with murder, but fled 
with Isolde. When his castle fell under siege, he prayed for 
guidance and was told that he must atone for his misdeeds 
by completing a quest, but growing fears about Isolde's 
fidelity caused him to abandon his quest. Because his 
mission was not accomplished, a great cataclysm swept 
the land. When Isolde gave birth to a son, Soth refused to 
believe that the child was his and slew them both. All were 
incinerated in a fire that swept through the castle, yet Soth 
would find no rest in death, becoming a death knight.

throws against spells and other magical effects. 
Marshal Undead. Unless the death knight is incapacitated, 
it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have 
advantage on saving throws aga inst features that turn undead. 
Spellcasting. The death knight is a 19th-level spellcaster. Its 
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit 
with spell attacks). It has the followin g paladin spells prepared: 
1st level (4 slots): command, compelled duel, searing smite 
2nd level (3 slots): hold per-son, magic weapon 
3rd level (3 slots): dispel magic, elemental weapon 
4th level (3 slots): banishment, staggering smite 
5th level (2 slots): destructive wave (necrotic) 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The death knight makes three longsword attacks. 
Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft. , 
one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 10 (1d10 + 
5) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (4d8) 
necrotic damage. 
Hellfire Orb (1JDay). The death knight hurls a magical ball 
of fire that explodes at a poi nt it can see within 120 feet of it. 
Each creature in a 20-foot·radius sphere centered on that point 
must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads 
around corners. A creature takes 35 (10d6) fire damage and 
35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
REACTIONS 
Parry. The death knight adds 6 to its AC against one melee 
attack that would hit it. To do so, the death knight must see the 
attacker and be wielding a melee wea pon.
