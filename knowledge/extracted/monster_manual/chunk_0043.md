NALFESHNEE 
The nalfeshnee is one of the most grotesque demons- a 
corpulent mockery of ape and boar standing twice the 
height of a human, with feathered wings that seem 
· too small for its bloated body. These brutish features 
conceal a remarkable intelligence and cunning. 
Nalfeshnees are devastating in combat, using 
their wings to soar above the front ranks and reach 
vulnerable adversaries that can be dispatched with little 
effort From the thick of battle, they telepathically bellow 
commands to lesser demons, even as they inspire a 
sense of dread that forces their foes to scatter and run. 
Nalfeshnees feed on hatred and despair, but they 
crave humanoid flesh above all else. They keep their 
larders filled with humanoids abducted from the 
Material Plane, then eat those creatures alive during 
elaborate feasts. Thinking of themselves as refined and 
cultured, nalfeshnees employ stained and rusted cutlery 
when they dine. 
UASIT 
Quasits infest the Lower Planes. Physically weak, they 
keep to the shadows to plot mischief and wickedness. 
More powerful demons use quasits as spies and 
messengers when they aren't devouring them or pulling 
them apart to pass the time. 
A quasit can assume animal forms, but in its true form 
ft looks like a 2-foot-tall green humanoid with a barbed 
tail and horns. The quasit has clawed fingers and toes, 
and 'these claws can deliver an irritating poison. It 
prefers to be invisible when it attacks. 
'SHADOW DEMON 
When a demon's body is destroyed but the fiend is 
prevented from reforming in the Abyss, its essence 
sometimes takes on a vague physical form. These 
shadow demons exist outside the normal abyssal 
hierarchy, since their creation results most often from 
mortal magic, not from transformation or promotion. 
Shadow demons all but disappear in the darkness, 
and they can creep about without making a sound. A 
shadow demon uses its insubstantial claws to feast on 
its victim's fears, to taste its memories, and drink in 
its doubts. Bright light harries this fiend and shows its 
distinct shape, resolving it from a blur of darkness to a 
winged humanoid creature whose lower body trails off 
into nothing, and whose claws rend a victim's mind. 
Shadowy Nature. A shadow demon doesn't require 
air, food, drink, or sleep. 
\ VROCK 
Vrocks are dull-witted, capricious fiends that live only 
to create pain and carnage. A vrock resembles a giant 
hybrid of humanoid and vulture, its gnarled, bestial body 
and broad wings stinking of offal.

can shake their wings, releasing clouds of toxic spores. 
Coveting pretty things, vrocks turn against each 
other for the chance to lay claim to cheap jewelry or 
ornamental stones. Despite their love of treasure,yrocks 
are difficult to bribe, seeing no reason to bargain when 
they can simply take what they want from a would-be 
bargainer's corpse. 
YOCHLOL 
The yochlols are the Handmaidens of Lolth-extensions 
of the Spider Queen's will dedicated to acting as 
her spies, taskmasters, and agents of villainy. They 
attend their goddess in the Demonweb Pits, but Lolth 
sometimes dispatches yochlols to the Material Plane 
to guard her temples and to aid her most devout 
priestesses. Yochlols don't form outside Lolth's realm of 
the Demonweb, and they serve no demon lords except 
their queen. 
Outside the Abyss, a yochlol can assume the guise 
of a female drow or monstrous spider to conceal its 
demonic form. In its true form, the fiend appears as a 
pillar of yellow slime with a single malevolent eye. In its 
drow and true form, a yochlol's touch carries the same 
venomous touch as its spider form's bite.
