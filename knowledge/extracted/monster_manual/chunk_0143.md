HooK HORROR 
A fierce predator of the Underdark, the hook horror 
aggressively defends its hunting grounds. The 
subterranean caverns where these creatures dwell echo 
with the constant clacking and scraping of their hooks 
as they wend their way up cliffs and along cavern walls. 
The monstrous hook horror has a head resembling a 
vulture's and the torso of an enormous beetle, with an 
exoskeleton studded by sharp, bony protuberances. It 
gains its name from its long, powerfully built arms a.nd 
legs, which end in wickedly curved hooked claws. 
Echoes in the Dark. Hook horrors communicate by 
striking their hooks against their exoskeletons or the 
stone surfaces around them. What sounds to others like 
random clacking noise is actually a complex language 
that only hook horrors understand, and which carries 
for miles through the echoing Underdark. 
Pack Predators. The omnivorous hook horrors eat 
lichens, fungi, plants, and any creature they can catch. 
A hook horror's hooked limbs give it excellent purchase 
on rock surfaces, and these creatures use their 
climbing skills to ambush prey from above. They hunt 
in packs, working together against the largest and most 
dangerous opponents. If a battle goes poorly, a hook 
horror quickly climbs a cavern wall to flee. 
Dedicated Clans. Hook horrors live in extended 
family groups or clans. Each clan is ruled by the eldest 
female, who typically places her mate in charge of 
the clan's hunters. Hook horrors lay eggs, which are 
clustered in a central, well-defended area of a clan's 
home caverns.

HYDRA 
The hydra is a reptilian horror with a crocodilian body 
and multiple heads on long, serpentine necks. Although 
its heads can be severed, the hydra magically regrows 
' them in short order. A typical specimen has five heads. 
At the dawn of time, Tiamat, the Queen of Evil 
Dragons, slew a rival dragon god named Lernaea and 
cast her blood across the multiverse. Each drop that fell 
upon a world spawned a multi-headed hydra consumed 
by a hunger as great as the fallen god's hatred. Great 
champions are known to test their mettle against these 
fearsome creatures. 
Everlasting Hunger. A rapacious and gluttonous 
monster, a hydra snatches and tears ~part its prey in a 
frenzy of feeding. When a hydra has cleared a territory 
of food and driven off any creatures smart enough to 
avoid it, it moves on to seek its meals elsewhere. A 
hydra's hunger is so great that if it can't feed, it might 
turn against itself, its heads attacking each other as the 
creature eats itself alive. 
Hardy Water DweJJers. Hydras are natural 
swimmers, dwelling in rivers, along lakeshores, in 
ocean shallows, and in wetland bogs. A hydra rarely 
requires shelter from the elements, so it doesn't 
normally have a lair. Only in colder climes are hydras 
drawn to the protection of sheltered caverns and ruins. 
When a hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads remains 
awake and alert, making the creature difficult to catch 
by surprise.

Hold Breath. The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour. 
Multiple Heads. The hydra has five heads. While it has more 
than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws 
against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, 
stunned, and knocked unconscious. 
Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single 
turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies. 
At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads 
that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage 
since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head 
regrown in this way. 
Reactive Heads. For each head the hydra has beyond 
one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for 
opportunity attacks. 
Wakeful. While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its 
heads is awake. 
Multiattack. The hydra makes as many bite attacks as it 
has heads. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.
