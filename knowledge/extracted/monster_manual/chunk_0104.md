FAERIE DRAGON 
A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly 
wings. It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its 
delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment f~dlng 
only if it is attacked. 
· 
Invisible Tricksters. The only warning of a faerie 
dragon's presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon'sfays 
out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims cop,tend. · 
with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might 
reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its "prey." 
Friendly and Bright. A faerie dragon has a sharp 
mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and 
a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie 
dragon's draconic nature by offering it "treasure" in the 
form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange 
for information or safe passage through its territory. 
The Colors of Age. A faerie dragon's scales change 
hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the 
rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting 
ability, gaining new spells as they mature.
