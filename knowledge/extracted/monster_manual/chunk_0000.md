Disclaimer: Any similarities between monsters depicted in this book and monsters that actually exist are purely 
coincidental. That goes double for mind jlayers, which absolutely, utterly, and completely do not exist, nor do they 
secretly run the Da[D team. Do we really need a disclaimer to tell you that? You shouldn't use your brain to consider 
such irrational thoughts. They only make the mind cluttered, c~nfused, and unpleasantly chewy. A good brain is nice, 
tender, and barely used. Go ahead, put down this book and watch some reality TV or Internet cat videos. They're really 
funny these days. You won't regret it. We say this only because we love you and your juicy, succulent gamer brain.
