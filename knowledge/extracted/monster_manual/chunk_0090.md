SILVER DRAGON 
The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, 
silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need. 
A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure 
metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and 
sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high 
over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. 
A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver 
highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its 
color gradually brightens until its individual scales are 
barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils 
fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury. 
Dragons of Virtue. Silver dragons believe that living 
a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring 
that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other 
sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to 
root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they 
will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil 
acts or harm the innocent. 
Friends of the Small Races. Silver dragons enjoy 
the company of other silver dragons. Their only true

ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then 
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage. 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. 
Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage. 
Frightful Presence. Each creature of the dragon's choice that 
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed 
on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a 
creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, 
friendships outside their own kin arise in the company 
of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much 
time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A 
silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such 
as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often 
has mortal companions with whom it develops strong 
frieqdships. 
, 
Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid 
lives on a regular basis, returning to their'true forms 
to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards 
and personal affairs. Because many lose track of· time 
while away, they sometimes return to find that their 
companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons 
often end up befriending several generations of · · 
humanoids within a single family as a result. 
Respect for Humanity. Silver dragons befriend 
humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as 
humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived 
elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest 
for life that silver dragons find fascinating. 
Hoarding History. Silver dragons love to possess 
relics of humanoid history. This includes the great 
the creature is immune to the clragon's Frightful Presence for 
the next 24 hours. 
Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6). The dragon uses one of the 
following breath weapons. 
Cold Breath. The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. 
Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution 
saving throw, taking 58 (13d8) cold damage on a failed save, 
or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Paralyzing Breath. The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a 60-
foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 
20 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A 
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
Change Shape. The dragon magically polymorphs into a 
humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than 
its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if 
it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or 
borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). 
In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, 
Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, 
lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as 
well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise 
replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or 
legendary actions of that form. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the 
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used 
at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The 
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. 
Detect. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack. 
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. 
Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed 
on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) 
bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can 
then fly up to half its flying speed.
