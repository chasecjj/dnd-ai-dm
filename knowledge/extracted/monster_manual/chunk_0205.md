SPECTER 
A specter is the angry, unfettered spirit of a humanoid 
that has been prevented from passing to the afterlife. 
Specters no longer possess connections to who or what 
they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever. 
Some are spawned when dark magic or the touch of a 
wraith rips a soul from a living body. 
Beyond Redemption. When a ghost's unfinished 
business is completed, it can rest at last. No such rest 
or redemption awaits a specter. It is doomed to the 
Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes 
with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out 
its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten 
through the ages of the world. 
Undying Hatred. Living creatures remind the specter 
that life is beyond its grasp. The mere sight of the living 
overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which 
can be abated only by destroying said life. A specter kills 
quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others 
of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, 
no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter 
always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow. 
DweJ/ers in Darkness. Sunlight represents a 
source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, 
and it pains them. When night falls, they leave their 
final resting places in search of living creatures to slay, 
knowing that few weapons can harm them in return. 
At the first light of dawn, they retreat back into the 
darkness, where they remain until night falls again. 
Undead Nature. A specter doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
VARIANT: POLTERGEIST 
A poltergeist is a different kind of specter-the confused, 
invisible spirit of an individual with no sense of how he or 
she died. A poltergeist expresses its rage by hurling creatures 
and objects using the power of its shattered psyche. 
A poltergeist has a challenge rating of 2 (450 XP) and gains 
the following additional trait: 
Invisibility. The poltergeist is invisible. 
I 
The poltergeist has the following action options in place of 
the sp~cter's Life Drain: 
Forceful Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 
one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) force damage. 
Telekinetic Thrust. The poltergeist targets a creature or 
unattended object within 30 feet of it. A creature must be 
Medium or smaller to be affected by this magic, and an 
object can weigh up to 150 pounds. 
If the target is a creature, the poltergeist makes a 
Charisma check contested by the target's Strength check. 
If the poltergeist wins the contest, the poltergeist hurls 
the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward. 
If the target then comes into contact with a hard surface 
or heavy object, the target takes 1 d6 damage per 10 
feet moved. 
If the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried, 
the poltergeist hurls it up to 30 feet in any direction. 
The poltergeist can use the object as a ranged weapon, 
attacking one creature along the object's path (+4 to hit) 
and dealing 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

ACTIONS 
Life Drain. Melee Spell Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. , one 
creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target must 
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or its hit point 
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. 
This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The 
target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
