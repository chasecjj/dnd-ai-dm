5~ 
Demogorgon towers three times the height of 
a human, his body as sinuous as a snake's and as 
powerful as a great ape's. Suckered tentacles take 
the place of his arms. His saurian lower torso ends 
in webbed and clawed feet, and a forked tail whose 
' whip-like tips are armed with cruel blades. The Prince 
of Demons has two baleful baboon heads, both of 
them mad. It is only the conflict between the two 
halves of his dual nature that keeps the demon lord's 
ambitions in check. 
GRAZ'ZT 
The demon lord Graz'zt appears as a darkly handsome 
figure nearly nine feet tall. Those who refer to the 
Dark Prince as the most humanoid of the demon 
lords vastly underestimate the capacity for evil in his 
scheming heart. 
Graz'zt is a striking physical specimen, whose 
demonic nature shows in his ebon skin, pointed ears, 
yellow fangs, crown of horns, and six-fingered hands. 
He delights in finery, pageantry, and sating his decadent 
desires with subjects and consorts alike, among whom 
incubi and succubi are often his favorites. 
jUIBLEX 
The demon lord of slimes and oozes, Juiblex is a stew 
of noxious fluids that lurks in the abyssal depths. The 
wretched Faceless Lord cares nothing for cultists 
or mortal servants, and its sole desire is to turn all 
creatures into formless copies of its horrid self. 
In·its resting state, Juiblex spreads out in a noxious 
mass, bubbling and filling the air with a profound 
stench. On the rare occasions when creatures confront 
the 'd.emon lord, Juiblex draws itself up into a shuddering 
cone of slime striated with veins of black and green. 
Baleful red eyes swim within its gelatinous body, while 
dripping pseudopods of ooze lash out hungrily at any 
creature they can reach. 
LOLTH 
The Demon Queen of Spiders is the evil matron of the 
drow. Her every thought is touched by malice, and the 
<depth of her viciousness can surprise even her most 
faithful priestesses. She directs her faithful while she 
weaves plots across the worlds of the Material Plane, 
looking forward to the time when her drow followers 
bring those worlds under her control. 
Lolth appears as a lithe, imperious drow matriarch 
when she manifests to her followers in the mortal 
realm, which she does with unusual frequency. When 
battle breaks out- or if she has a reason to remind her 
followers to fear her- Lolth's lower body transforms into 
that of a huge demonic spider, whose spike-tipped legs 
and mandibles tear foes apart. 
0RCUS 
Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood 
Lord, the demon lord Orcus is worshiped by the undead 
and by living creatures that channel the power of 
undeath. A brooding and nihilistic entity, Orcus yearns 
to make the multi verse a place of death and darkness, 
forever unchanging except by his will.

Th~ Demon Prince of Undeath l's a foui lmd corpulent 
cr~ature, ~ith a humanoid torso, powerful goat·legs, 
and the desiccated head of a ram. His sore-ridden body 
stinks of disease, but his decaying head and glowing 
red eyes are as a creature already dead. Great black 
bat wings sprout from his back, stirring reeking air 
as he moves. 
Orcus wields a malevolent artifact known as the 
Wand ofOrcus, a mace-like rod of obsidian topped 
by a humanoid skull. He surrounds himself with 
undead, and living creatures not under his control are 
anathema to him. 
YEENOGHU 
Known as the Gnoll Lord and the Beast of Butchery, 
the demon lord Yeenoghu hungers for slaughter 
and senseless destruction. Gnolls are his mortal 
instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater 
atrocities in his name. Delighting in sorrow and 
hopelessness, the Gnoll Lord yearns to turn the world 
into a wasteland in which the last surviving gnolls tear 
each other apart for the right to feast upon the dead. 
Yeenoghu appears as a huge, scarred gnoll with a 
spiky crest of black spines, and eyes that burn with 
emerald flame. His armor is a patchwork of shields and 
breastplates claimed from fallen foes, and decorated by 
those foes' flayed skins. Yeenoghu can summon a triple 
flail he calls the Butcher, which he wields to deadly 
effect or wills to fly independently into battle as he tears 
foes apart with teeth and claws. 
OTHER DEMON LORDS 
No one knows the full number of demon lords that 
rage in the Abyss. Given the infinite depths of that 
plane, powerful demons constantly rise to become 
demon lords, then fall almost as quickly. Among the 
demon lords whose power has endured long enough 
for demonologists to name them are Fraz-Urb'luu, the 
Prince of Deception; Kostchtchie, the Prince of Wrath; 
Pazuzu, Prince of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms; and 
Zuggtmoy, Lady of Fungi. 
DEMON TYPES 
Demonologists organize the chaotic distribution of 
demons into broad categories of power known as 
types. Most demons fit into one of six major types, with 
the weakest categorized as Type 1 and the strongest 
as Type 6. Demons outside the six main types are 
categorized as minor demons and demon lords.
