RED DRAGON 
The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons 
tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They 
are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their 
conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their 
disdain for other creatures. 
The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red 
dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define 
its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, 
and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings 
are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a 
blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles 
metal burned blue by fire. 
The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright 
glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming 
as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its 
pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons 
have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs. 
Mountain Masters. Red dragons prefer mountainous 
terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can 
perch high and survey their domain. Their preference 
for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-
dwelling copper dragons from time to time. 
Arrogant Tyrants. Red dragons fly into destructive 
rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so 
ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the 
archet'ypical evil dragon by many cultures. 
No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the 
red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings 
and emperors, and view the rest of dragon kind as 
inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule 
in her name, red dragons consider the world and every 
creature in it as theirs to command. 
Status and Slaves. Red dragons are fiercely territorial 
and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about 
events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser 
creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They 
are most interested in news about other red dragons, 
with which they compete constantly for status. 
When it requires servants, a red dragon demands 
fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't 
forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims 
lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red 
dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten 
for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning 
over the creature in an attempt to stay alive. 
Obsessive Collectors. Red dragons value wealth 
above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. 
They covet anything of monetary value, and can often 
judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a 
glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure 
claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting 
that treasure to prove its superiority. 
A red dragon knows the value and provenance of 
every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact 
location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, 
igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief 
without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon 
goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in 
an attempt to sate its wrath. 
A RED DRAGON'S LAIR 
Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in 
caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep 
halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. 
Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most 
highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that 
hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic 
gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. 
· • 
With its hoard well protected deep within the lair," 
a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the 
mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights 
of the world are the throne from which it can look 
out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it 
seeks to control. 
Throughout the lair complex, servants erect 
monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story 
of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it 
has conquered. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; 
the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
• Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon 
can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 
5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's 
area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, tak-
ing 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 
• A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around 
the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on 
the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 
Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. 
• Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius 
sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 
120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, 
and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initia-
tive count 20 on the next round. Each creature that 
starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end 
of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is 
incapacitated. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is 
warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or 
more of the following effects: 
• Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the 
dragon's lair. 
Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernatu-
rally warm and tainted by sulfur. 
• Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form 
portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing crea-
tures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby. 
If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course 
of 1dl0 days.
