Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that 
the hags' rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When 
confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it 
amusing to string the fool along for a while before 
teaching it a permanent lesson. 
Dark Lairs. Hags dwell in dark and twisted 
woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, 
and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape 
around a hag's lair reflects the creature's 
noxiousness, such that the land itself can 
attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by 
darkness attack passersby, while vines snake 
through the undergrowth to snare and drag off 
creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn 
the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and 
sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers. 
GREEN HAG 
The wretched and hateful green hags dwell in dying 
forests, lonely swamps, and misty moors, making 
their homes in caves. Green hags love to manipulate 
other creatures into doing their bidding, masking their 
intentions behind layers of deception. They lure victims 
to them by mimicking voices calling out for help, or 
drive unwanted visitors away by imitating the cries of 
fierce beasts. 
Obsession with Tragedy. Green hags revel in 
the failings and tragedies of other creatures. They 
derive jby from bringing people low and seeing hope 
turn into despair, not just for individuals but also for 
whole nations. 
Covens. A green hag that is part of a coven (see 
the "Hag Covens" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 
5 (1,800 XP).

Amphibious. The hag can breathe air and water. 
Innate Spellcasting. The hag's innate spellcasting ability 
is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the 
following spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery 
Mimicry. The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid 
voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are 
imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) cheok. 
ACTIONS 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage. 
Illusory Appearance. The hag covers herself and anything she is 
wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look 
like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. 
The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or 
if she dies. 
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical 
inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth 
skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. 
Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect 
the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check to discern that the hag is disguised. 
Invisible Passage. The hag magically turns invisible until she 
attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as 
if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no 
physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by 
magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.
