ACTIONS 
Mt.iltiattack. The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard 
and one with its glaive. 
Beard. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed 
on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 
minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit 
points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
Glaive. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 8 (1dl0 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature 
other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 
12 Constitution saving throw or lose 5 (1dl0) hit points at the 
start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time 
the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage 
dealt by the wound increases by 5 (ld10). Any creature can take 
an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom 
(Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives 
magical healing.
