QUAGGOTH 
Savage and territorial, quaggoths climb the chasms 
of the Underdark. They maul their foes in a frenzy, 
becoming even more murderous in the face of death. 
Quaggoth Origins. Quaggoths were never an 
enlightened species, but they were not always the brutal 
Underdark denizens they are today. In a distant age, 
quaggoth tribes dwelled upon the surface as nocturnal 
arboreal hunters, possessing their own language and 
culture. When elves appeared in the mortal realm, they 
clashed with the quaggoths, eventually driving them to 
near extinction. Only by fleeing deep into the Underdark 
did the quaggoths survive. 
As they passed the ages deep beneath the world, the 
quaggoths' fur lost its color and their vision adapted to 
the darkness, even as the constant danger and weird 
magic of their new realm transformed them. Turning 
increasingly brutal and savage, they ate whatever food 
they could find-and when they could not find it, they 
preyed on each other. As cannibalism became part of 
their culture, their past was abandoned. 
Servants of the Drow. The ancient enmity between 
quaggoths and surface elves makes them easy converts 
to the dark elf cause. In recent years, the drow have 
taken an interest in breeding quaggoths, encouraging 
their ferocity while strengthening their obedience. 
Wealthy drow houses have legions of quaggoths at 
their command. Even worse, the drow cultivate the 
quaggoths' hatred of the elves by leading them on 
surface raids against known elven enclaves. 
Thonots. Some quaggoths absorb psionic energy that 
suffuses certain parts of the Underdark. When a tribe 
discovers that one of its own has inherited such powers, 
they press it into the role of tribal shaman, or thonot. 
A thonot keep a tribe's lore and ensures its superiority 
against enemies. A thonot that fails the tribe is slain and 
devoured in a cannibalistic ritual, in the hope that its 
power passes to another more worthy quaggoth. 
Poison Immunity. Generations of hunting venomous 
subterranean creatures and perpetual exposure to the 
molds and fungi that grow in the depths have forced 
quaggoths to adapt immunities to poisons of all kinds.
