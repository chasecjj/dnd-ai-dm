GALEB DUHR 
The galeb duhr is a boulder-like creature with stumpy 
appendages that act as arms and legs. It has the ability 
to animate the rocks and boulders around it, and is thus 
usually encountered in rocky terrain. 
Powerful magic allows a spellcaster to summon a 
galeb duhr from the Plane of Earth. Some galeb duhr 
also form naturally in places touched by that plane. The 
galeb duhr is imbued with greater intelligence than most 
elementals, allowing it to better assess threats and to 
communicate with creatures entering its guarded area. 
Stone Guardian. A galeb duhr doesn't age or require 
sustenance, making it an excellent sentinel. A powerful 
druid might charge a galeb duhr with protecting a stone 
circle or sacred hilltop. Another galeb duhr might be 
created to guard an underground tomb or a wizard's 
tower. When it chooses to, the galeb duhr can make 
itself look like an ordinary boulder, remaining perfectly 
still for years at .a time.

False Appearance. While the galeb duhr remains motionless, it 
is indistinguishable from a normal boulder. 
Rolling Charge. If the galeb duhr rolls at least 20 feet straight 
toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same 
turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If 
the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength 
saving throw or be knocked prone. 
ACTIONS 
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. 
Animate Boulders (1fDay). The galeb duhr magically animates 
up to two boulders it can see within 60 feet of it. A boulder has 
statistics like those of a galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1 
and Charisma 1, it can't be charmed or frightened, and it lacks 
this action option. A boulder remains animated as long as 
the galeb duhr maintains concentration, up to l minute (as if 
concentrating on a spell). 
A galeb duhr is permanently bound to the Material 
Plane, so that when it dies, it doesn't return to the Plane 
of Earth. It has an excellent memory and is more than 
happy to share information regarding its environment 
with creatures it doesn't regard as threats. 
Stone Connection. A galeb duhr can become one with 
the earth around it, allowing it to imbue nearby rocks 
and boulders with a semblance of life. The galeb duhr 
uses its animated boulders to frighten away interlopers 
and defend whatever it has been charged to protect. 
When it needs to move close to those intruders, it 
presses its limbs tight to its body and rolls forward at a 
furious pace.
