GREEN DRAGON 
The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, 
green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the 
upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and 
thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting 
and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests 
they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression 
that is often less about territory than it is about gaining 
power and wealth with as little effort as possible. 
A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline 
and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues 
down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. 
A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery 
spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck. 
A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade 
of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green 
dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning 
shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it 
blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have 
a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and 
lighter toward the trailing edges. 
A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body 
than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass 
over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With 
its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer 
over the tops of trees without rearing up. 
Capricious Hunters. A green dragon hunts by 
patrolling its forest territory from the air and the 
ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume 
shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its 
favorite prey is elve~.

Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of 
double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, 
but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing 
with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and 
monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing 
with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with 
sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust 
for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and 
it is always on the lookout for creatures that can he'lp it 
further its ambitions. 
A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its 
assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for day.s. ~ 
If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its 
appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its x 
foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control 
over survivors. It then learns what it can about other 
creatures' activities near its territory, and about any 
treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally 
release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a 
creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die. 
Manipulative Schemers. A wily and subtle creature, 
a green dragon bends other creatures to its will 
by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. 
Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a 
green dragon eventually realizes that the creature 
is only pretending to serve while it assesses its 
would-be master. 
When manipulating other creatures, green dragons 
are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among 
their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially 
when dealing with dragons of the same age and status. 
Conflict and Corruption. Green dragons sometimes 
clash with other dragons over territory where forest 
crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically 
pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-
sometimes for decades- for the chance to slay the other 
dragon, then claim its lair and hoard. 
Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient 
creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, 
orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and 
bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes 
wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of 
insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest 
reflecting those minions' tortured dreams. 
Living Treasures. A green dragon's favored treasures 
are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including 
significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known 
sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, 
a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical 
instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects. 
A GREEN DRAGON'S LAIR 
The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete 
for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and 
with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest 
controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual 
fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, 
carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath. 
The moss-covered trees grow close together except • 
where winding pathways trace their way like a maze ' 
into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches, the
