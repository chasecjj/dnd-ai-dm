Trampling Charge. If the gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight 
toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the 
same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength 
saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the 
gorgon can make one attack with its hooves against it as a 
bonus action. 
ACTIONS 
Gore. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage. 
Hooves. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. 
Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6). The gorgon exhales 
petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area 
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. 
The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end 
of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. 
On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater 
restoration spell or other magic. 
GORGON 
Few creatures that encounter a gorgon live to tell about 
it. Its body is covered in iron plates, and its nostrils fume 
with green vapor. 
Horrific Structure. A gorgon's iron plates range from 
steely black to gleaming silver, but this natural armor 
in no way hinders its movement or mobility. The oils of 
its body lubricate the armor. A sick or inactive gorgon 
gathers rust like fungus or mange. When a rusty gorgon 
moves, its plates squeal as they rub together. 
Monstrous Predator. When a gorgon spots potential 
prey, it charges with a hideous clamor of metal on 
metal. When the gorgon hits, it pulverizes the foe and 
sends its sprawling, then tramples it to death with its 
cruel hooves. Faced with multiple foes, the gorgon 
exhales its deadly vapor to overcome the creatures 
it touches by turning them to stone. When it grows 
hungry, it smashes its petrified prey to rubble and uses 
its strong teeth to grind the stone into a powder that 
provides nourishment. The crisscrossing network of 
trampled trails and splintered trees that surrounds a 
gorgon lair is strewn with the uneaten fragments of its 
shattered foes.

AN ADVENT URER ' S ACCO UNT OF A 
GRELl ATTACK IN KHYBER, PUBLISHED 
IN TliE KORRANBERG CliRONICLE 
A grell resembles a bulbous floating brain with a wide, 
sharp beak. Its ten long tentacles are made of hundreds 
of ring-shaped muscles sheathed in tough fibrous 
hide. Sharp barbs line the tip each tentacle and inject 
paralytic venom. The grell can partially retract its barbs 
into its tentacles to handle or manipulate objects it 
doesn't want to pierce or tear. 
Grells have no eyes and floats by means of a sort of 
levitation. They have keen hearing, however, and their 
skin is sensitive to vibrations and electrical fields, 
GRELL 
allowing them to detect the presence of creatures and 
objects in their immediate vicinity. The creature's ability 
to manipulate electricity to sense and move also allow it 
to absorb lightning without harm. 
Although solitary by nature, grells sometimes gather 
in small groups called covens. 
Floating Ambushers. A grell prefers to ambush 
lone creatures or stragglers, hovering silently near the 
ceiling of a passage or cavern until a suitable target 
passes below, whereupon it descends quickly and wraps 
its tentacles around its prey. It then floats away to its lair 
with the paralyzed creature in its clutches. 
Alien Devourers. Grell are alien predators that group 
other creatures into three categories: edibles, inedibles, 
and Great Eaters (those rare creatures that might prey 
on a grell). Grells have no compunction about attacking 
creatures they classify as edible, including humanoids. 
They tend to avoid bigger creatures that they have little 
hope of carrying away. 
A grell will sometimes allow adventurers to wage 
war on the other monstrous inhabitants of the dungeon 
complex it calls home, staying out of the adventurers' 
way as they dispose of larger threats while waiting for 
the right time to strike.

Multiattack. The grell makes two attacks: one with its tentacles 
and one with its beak. 
Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10ft., one 
creature. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target 
must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be 
poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is paralyzed, and 
it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on a success. 
The target is also grappled (escape DC 15). If the target is 
Medium or smaller, it is also restrained until this grapple ends. 
While grappling the target, the grell has advantage on attack 
rolls against it and can't use this attack against other targets. 
When the grell moves, any Medium or smaller target it is 
grappling moves with it. 
Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. , one creature. 
Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage.
