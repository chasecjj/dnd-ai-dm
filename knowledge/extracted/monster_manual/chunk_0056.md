Devil's Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's 
darkvision. 
Magic Resistance. The devil has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The devil makes three melee attacks: two with its 
fork and one with its tail. It can use Hurl Flame in place of any 
melee attack. 
Fork. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage. 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 10 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature 
other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 
17 Constitution saving throw or lose 10 (3d6) hit points at the 
start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time 
the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage 
dealt by the wound increases by 10 (3d6). Any creature can take 
an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom 
(Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives 
magical healing. 
Hurl Flame. Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 150 ft., one 
target. Hit: 14 (4d6) fire damage. If the target is a flammable 
object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
