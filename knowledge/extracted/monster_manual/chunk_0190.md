RAKSHASA 
The rakshasa employs delicacy and misdirection in its 
pursuit of dominion over others. Few creatures ever see 
the fiend in its true form, for it can take on any guise it 
wants, although it prefers to masquerade as someone 
powerful or influential: a noble, cardinal, or rich 
merchant, for example. A rakshasa's true form combines 
the features of a human and a tiger, with one noteworthy 
deformity: its palms are where the backs of the hands 
would be on a human. 
Evil Spirits in Mortal Flesh. Rakshasas originated 
long ago in the Nine Hells, when powerful devils 
created a dark ritual to free their essence from their 
fiendish bodies in order to escape the Lower Planes. A 
rakshasa enters the Material Plane to feed its appetite 
for humanoid flesh and evil schemes. It selects its prey 
with care, taking pains to keep its presence in the 
world a secret. 
Evil Reborn. For a rakshasa, death on the Material 
Plane means an agonizing and torturous return to the 
Nine Hells, where its essence remains trapped until its 
body reforms- a process that cart take months or years. 
When the rakshasa is reborn, it has all the memories 
and knowledge of its former life, and it seeks retribution 
against the one who slew it. If the target has somehow 
slipped through its grasp, the rakshasa might punish its 
killer's family, friends, or descendants. 
Like devils, rakshasas killed in the Nine Hells are 
forever destroyed.

Multiattack. The rakshasa makes two claw attacks. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, and the target is cursed if 
it is a creature. The magical curse takes effect whenever the 
target takes a short or long rest, filling the target's thoughts 
with horrible images and dreams. The cursed target gains no 
benefit from finishing a short or long rest. The curse lasts until 
it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.
