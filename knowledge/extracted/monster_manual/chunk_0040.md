manages to dro19 a demon in <wmbat, the fiend dissolves 
into fori ichor. It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its 
mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed. 
The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the 
Abyss and kill it there. 
Protected Essence. A powerful demon can take steps 
to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and 
abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of 
that essence is ceded. If the demon's abyssal form is 
ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at 
a time and place of its choosing. 
Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous 
enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks 
drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A 
creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors 
from the demon whose life essence the amulet holds-
or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is 
destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the 
Abyss for a year and a day. 
Demonic Cults. Despite the dark risks involved in 
dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with 
creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords 
manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever 
greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord's 
ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. 
However, a demon r~gards any mortals in its service as 
tools td use and then discard at its whim, consigning 
their mortal souls to the Abyss. 
Demon Summoning. Few acts are as dangerous as 
summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain 
freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though 
demons ,yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they 
show no gratitude when brought there, raging against 
their prisons and demanding release. 
Those who would risk summoning a demon might 
do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, 
or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute 
evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced 
summoners know the specific spells and magic items 
that can force a demon to bend to another's will. If a 
single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows 
no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim 
of its wrath. 
Bound Demons. The Book of Vile Darkness, the 
Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Jggwilv 
are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These 
ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the 
essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it 
within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing 
the fiend's return to the Abyss. 
An object that binds a demon must be specially 
prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. 
It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the 
air around it. A creature that handles such an object 
experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, 
but is able to control the demon whose essence is 
trapped within the object. Destroying the object 
frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge 
against its binder. 
Dem"onic Possession. No matter how secure its 
bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape 
an object that holds it. When a demonic essence 
emerges from its container, it can possess a m0rtal host. 
Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful 
'. 
possession. Other times, it unleashes the full bttmt of its 
fiendish drives through its new form. 
As long as the demon remains in possession of its 
host, the soul of that host is in danger of being d~agged 
to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the 
flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a qeature. 
and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the ~. 
possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive 
the demonic spirit out of its host. 
DEMON LORDS 
The chaotic power of the Abyss rewards demon~ 0f 
particular ruthlessness and ingenuity with a dark . 
blessing, transforming them into unique fiends whose 
power can rival the gods. These demon lords rule 
through cunning or brute force, hopipg to one day claim 
the prize of absolute control over all the Abyss. 
Reward for Outsiders. Although most demon 
lords rise up from the vast and uncountable mobs of 
demons rampaging across the Abyss, the plane also 
rewards outsiders that conquer any of its infinite layers. 
The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after 
Corellon Larethian cast her into the Abyss for betraying 
elvenkind. Sages claim that the Dark Prince Graz'zt 
originated on some other plane before stealing his 
abyssal title from another long-forgotten demon lord. 
Power and Control. The greatest sign of a demon 
lord's power is its ability to reshape an abyssal realm. A 
layer of the Abyss controlled by a demon lord becomes 
a twisted reflection of that fiend's vile personality, 
and demon lords seldom leave their realms for fear of 
allowing another creature to reshape and seize it. 
As with other demons, a demon lord that dies on 
another plane has its essence return to the Abyss, where 
it reforms into a new body. Likewise, a demon lord that 
dies in the Abyss is permanently destroyed. Most demon 
lords keep a portion of their essence safely stored away 
to prevent such a fate. 
BAPHOMET 
The demon lord Baphomet, also known as the Horned 
King and the Prince of Beasts, rules over minotaurs and 
other savage creatures. If he had his way, civilization 
would crumble and all races would embrace their base 
animal savagery. 
The Prince of Beasts appears as a huge, black-furred 
minotaur with iron horns, red eyes, and a blood-soaked 
mouth. His iron crown is topped with the rotting heads 
of his enemies, while his dark armor is set with spikes 
and skull-like serrations. He carries a huge glaive 
named Heartcleaver, but often hurls it into the fray so as 
to face his enemies with horns and hooves. 
DEMO GORGON 
The Sibilant Beast and the self-styled Prince of 
Demons, Demogorgon yearns for nothing less than 
undoing the order of the multiverse. An insane 
assemblage of features and drives, the Prince of 
Demons inspires fear and hatred among other demons 
and demon lords.
