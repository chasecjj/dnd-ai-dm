SALAMANDERS 
Salamanders slither across the Sea of Ash on the 
Elemental Plane of Fire, their sinuous coils and jagged 
spines smoldering. Intense heat washes off their bodies, 
while their yellow eyes glow like candles in the deep-set 
hollows of their hawkish faces. 
Salamanders adore power, and they delight in setting 
fire to things. Outside their home plane, they play among 
the burning skeletons of charred trees as forest fires 
rage around them, or slither down the slopes of erupting 
volcanoes to linger in fire pits and magma floes. 
Fire Snakes. Salamanders hatch from eggs that 
are two-foot-diameter spheres of smoldering obsidian. 
When a salamander is ready to hatch, it melts its way 
through the egg's thick shell and emerges as a fire 
snake. A fire snake matures into a salamander adult 
within a year. 
Slaves of the Efreet. Long ago, the efreet hired azers 
to build the fabled City of Brass, but then failed in their 
attempt to enslave that mystical race when the azers' 
work was done. Turning instead to strike against the 
salamanders, the efreet had better luck in establishing 
a slave race, which they use to unleash war and 
destruction across the planes. 
Salamanders despise the azers, believing that if 
the efreet had succeeded in dominating that race of 
elemental crafters, the salamanders would still be free. 
The efreet use this enmity to their own advantage, 
stoking the salamanders' hatred and pitting them 
against the efreets' former servants. 
The efreet suffer salamanders to serve no other 
master; when efreet encounter salamanders dedicated 
to the cults of Elemental Evil, they slay them rather than 
taking them as slaves. 
Domineering Nobles. Although salamanders follow 
the destructive impulses of their fiery nature, slavery 
under the efreet has impacted the culture of free 
salamanders. They rule their own societies according 
to the efreet model, in which larger and stronger 
salamanders claim dominion over their lesser kin. 
As salamanders age, they increase in size and status, 
. rising to positions of power as cruel nobles among their 
kind. Nobles rule wandering bands of salamanders, 
which move across the Elemental Plane of Fire like 
desert nomads, raiding other communities for treasure. 
Living Forges. Salamanders generate intense heat, 
and when they fight, their weapons glow red and 
sear the bodies of their enemies on contact. Even 
approaching a salamander is dangerous, since flesh 
blisters and burns in its proximity. 
This inherent heat is an asset to salamanders' skill 
as smiths, allowing them to soften and shape iron and 
steel with their bare hands. Although not as meticulous 
as azers, salamanders number among the greatest 
metalsmiths in all the planes. Powerful creatures 
summon them as warriors, but others enlist the 
salamanders for their crafting skills, or bind them to 
forges and ovens to generate limitless heat.
