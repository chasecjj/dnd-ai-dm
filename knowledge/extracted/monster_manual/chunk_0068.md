BLUE DRAGON 
Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies 
over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds 
and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's 
reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, 
searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their 
territories against all potential competitors, especially 
brass dragons. 
A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled 
ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. 
Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its 
brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw. 
A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent 
azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the 
desert sands. As the dragon ages, its ·scales become 
thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles 
with static electricity. These effects intensify when the 
dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of 
ozone and dusty air. 
Vain and Deadly. A blue dragon will not stand for any 
remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking 
great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and 
other lesser creatures. 
A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. 
When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an 
extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a 
distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of 
harm's reach as it waits to attack again. 
Desert Predators. Though they sometimes eat cacti 
and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue 
dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd 
animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning 
breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits 
make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert 
caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient 
collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye. 
When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert 
sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the 
surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When 
prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from 
its wings like an avalanche as it attacks. 
Overlords and Minions. Blue dragons covet valuable 
and talented creatures whose service reinforces their 
sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and 
assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, 
which rewards loyal service handsomely. 
A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, 
and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed 
within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and 
other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for 
additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes 
attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them. 
Hoarders of Gems. Though blue dragons collect 
anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond 
of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and 
beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring 
jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems. 
A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep 
in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets 
in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and 
eliminate would-be thieves. 
A BLUE DkAGON'S LAIR 
Blue dtagons make their lairs in barren places, 
using' their lightning breath and their burrowing 
ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels 
beneath the sands. 
Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's 
lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate 
the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that 
are the dragon's first line of defense. 
A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up 
its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows 
out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. 
When it returns later, it collects its possessions- along 
with the wealth of the dead intruders. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; 
the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that 
the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature 
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or 
take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked 
prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and 
unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an 
action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the 
buried state on a success. 
A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere 
centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet 
of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature 
in the cloud must succeed on a DC ls''constitution 
saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature 
can repeat the saving throw at the ertd of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
• Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between 
two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can 
see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 
120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must 
succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 
(3d6) lightning damage. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair 
is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or 
more of the following effects: 
• Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair. 
• Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A 
dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it 
can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence 
and Charisma of 1 (- 5). 
• Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's 
lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance 
with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin 
crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 
15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 x 10 feet into 
the sinkhole. 
If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear 
immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 
days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.
