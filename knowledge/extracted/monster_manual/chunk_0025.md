BUGBEARS 
Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. S urviving 
by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise 
being bossed around, but their love of carnage means 
they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and 
treasure are assured. 
Goblinoids. Bugbears are often found in the company 
of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears 
usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully 
hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return 
for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when 
paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins 
and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much 
bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these 
creatures are a potent force. 
Followers ofHruggek. Bugbears worship Hruggek, 
a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the 
absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war 
bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears 
believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance 
to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves 
worthy by defeating as many foes as possible. 
Venal Ambushers. Despite their intimidating builds, 
bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of 
setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are 
dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied 
food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any 
bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of 
a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of 
the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help 
pursuers track down its former companions if doing so 
saves its life.
