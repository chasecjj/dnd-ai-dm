UNICORN 
Unicorns dwell in enchanted forests. Unrelated to the 
horses it resembles, a unicorn is a celestial creature 
that wanders sylvan realms, its white form glimmering 
like starlight. 
A unicorn's brow sports a single spiraling horn 
of ivory whose magical touch can heal the sick and 
the injured. Its ears catch the words and whispers 
of the creatures that share its domain, and it knows 
the tongues of elves and sylvan folk. Unicorns allow 
good-hearted creatures to enter their woods to hunt or 
gather food, but they hold evil ever at bay. Foul-hearted 
creatures seldom leave a unicorn's domain alive. 
Divine Guardians. Good deities placed unicorns on 
the Material Plane to ward away evil and preserve and 
protect sacred places. Most unicorns protect a bounded 
realm such as an enchanted forest. However, the gods 
sometimes send a unicorn to guard sacred artifacts or 
protect specific creatures. When the forces of darkness 
strike against an individual the gods wish to protect, 
they might send that individual to a unicorn's forest, 
where evil creatures pursue at their peril. 
Unicorns most often serve deities of the forest and 
woodlands, including the gods of benevolent fey. 
Although all unicorns have natural healing power, 
some serve the gods in greater capacities, performing 
miracles normally reserved for high priests. 
Forest Lords. A unicorn's forest is a celestial realm 
where nothing that occurs beneath the sun-dappled 
leaves escapes the creature's notice. A unicorn hears 
each breathy tune sung by the elves that reside amid 
the treetops. It senses where every caterpillar spins 
its cocoon, each leaf and branch upon which a bright 
butterfly rests its tired wings. 
In a unicorn's forest, a sense of calm pervades. From 
wolves and foxes to birds, squirrels, and tiny insects, 
the creatures of a unicorn's domain seem quite tame. 
Pixies, sprites, satyrs, dryads, and other normally 
mercurial fey loyally serve a unicorn when they 
dwell within its woods. Under a unicorn's protection, 
creatures feel safe from the threat of encroaching 
civilization and the insidious spread of evil. 
A unicorn roams its domain constantly, moving ever 
so carefully so as not to disturb other denizens. A 
creature might catch a passing glimpse of the unicorn 
then suddenly see nothing but the wild woods. 
Sacred Horns. A unicorn's horn is the focus of its 
power, a shard of divine magic wrought in spiraling 
ivory. Wands of unicorn horn channel powerful magic, 
while unicorn horn weapons strike with divine force. 
Wizards can work powdered unicorn horn into potent 
potions and scroll ink, or use it as a component in 
eldritch rituals. However, any creature that takes a role, 
no matter how small, in slaying a unicorn is likely to 
become the target of divine retribution. 
' 
Blessed Mounts. When darkness and evil threaten 
to overwhelm the mortal world, the gods sometimes 
see fit to pair a unicorn mount with a champion. A 
paladin astride a unicorn is a sign of the gods' direct 
intervention in the affairs of the mortal realm. It is a 
holy alliance made to cleave the heads from demons and 
banish devils back to the Nine Hells. 
As long as the troubled times of darkness persist, 
the unicorn stays by the champion, its horn shining 
brightly to drive back the night. However, if the gods' 
champion falls from grace or turns from the cause 
of righteousness and good, the unicorn departs, 
never to return. 
A UNICORN's LAIR 
A unicorn's lair might be an ancient ruin overgrown 
with vines, a misty clearing surrounded by mighty oaks, 
a flower-covered hilltop alive with butterflies, or some 
other serene woodland location. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
Transformed by the creature's celestial presence, the 
domain of a unicorn might include any of the following 
magical effects: 
• Open flames of a non magical nature are extinguished 
within the unicorn's domain. Torches and campfires 
refuse to burn, but closed lanterns are unaffected. 
Creatures native to the unicorn's domain have an eas-
ier time hiding; they have advantage on all Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks made to hide. 
• When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses 
a magical effect that causes another good-aligned 
creature to regain hit points, the target regains the 
maximum number of hit points possible for the 
spell or effect. 
Curses affecting any good-aligned creature 
are suppressed. 
If the unicorn dies, these effects end immediately.
