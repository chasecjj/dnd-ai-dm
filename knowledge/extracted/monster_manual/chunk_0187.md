The elusive pseudodragon dwells in the quiet places of 
the world, making its home in the hollows of trees and 
small caves. With its red-brown scales, horns, and a 
maw filled with sharp teeth, a pseudodragon resembles 
a tiny red dragon but its disposition is playful. 
Quiet and Defensive. Pseudodragons have little 
interest in other creatures, and they avoid them 
whenever possible. If it is attacked, a pseudodragon 
fights back using the poisonous stinger at the tip of its 
tail, one jab of which can put a creature into a catatonic 
state that can last for hours. 
Draconic Familiars. Mages often seek out 
pseudodragons, whose agreeable disposition, telepathic 
ability, and resistance to magic make them superior 
familiars. Pseudodragons are selective when it comes 
to choosing companions, but they can sometimes 
be won o~er with gifts of food or treasure. When 
a pseudodragon finds an agreeable companion, it 
bonds with that person as long as it is treated fairly. 
A pseudodr.agon puts up with no ill treatment, and 
it abandons a manipulative or abusive companion 
without warning. 
Language of Emotion. Pseudodragons can't speak, 
but they communicate using a limited form of telepathy 
that allows them to share basic ideas such as hunger, 
curiosity, or affection. When it bonds with a companion, 
a pseudodragon can communicate what it sees and 
hears even over long distances. 
A pseudodragon often vocalizes animal noises. A 
rasping purr indicates pleasure, while a hiss means 
unpleasant surprise. A bird-like chirping represents 
desire, and a growl always means anger or discontent. 
VARIANT: PSEUDODRAGON FAMILIAR 
Some pseudodragons are willing to serve spellcasters as a 
familiar. Such pseudodragons have the following trait. 
Familiar. The pseudodragon can serve another creature as 
a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing 
companion. While the two are bonded, the companion 
can sense what the pseudodragon senses as long as they 
are within 1 mile of each other. While the pseudodragon is 
within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the 
pseudodragon's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and 
for any reason, the pseudodragon can end its service as a 
familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
