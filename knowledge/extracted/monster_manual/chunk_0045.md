Drone. The chasme produces a horrid droning sound to 
which demons are immune. Any other creature that starts its 
turn within 30 feet of the chasme must succeed on a DC 12 
Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. 
A creature that can't hear the drone automatically succeeds on 
the save. The effect on the creature ends if it takes damage or if 
another creature takes an action to splash it with holy water. If 
a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, 
it is immune to the drone for the next 24 hours. 
Magic Resistance. The chasme has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Spider Climb. The chasme can climb difficult surfaces, 
including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 
ACTIONS 
Proboscis. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
creature. Hit: 16 (4d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 24 (7d6) 
necrotic damage, and the target's hit point maximum is 
reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. If 
this effect reduces a creature's hit point maximum to 0, the 
creature dies. This reduction to a creature's hit point maximum 
lasts unti l the creature finishes a long rest or until it is affected 
by a spell like greater restoration.

ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite 
and one with its claws. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 3 (1d6) piercing damage. 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 5 (2d4) slashing damage. 
Fetid Cloud (1/Day). A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas 
extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, 
and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a 
strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that 
area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be 
poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this 
way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on 
its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.
