these whips are also the archpriest's children, and their 
primary role in kuo-toan society is to fight to the death 
to claim the throne when the archpriest dies. If a whip 
displeases the archpriest, the archpriest can strip it of 
its spell casting ability, if not its life. 
The archpriest's decrees are enforced by monitors, 
devout kuo-toa that act as the archpriest's eyes and ears. 
Monitors are deadly hand-to-hand combatants, and 
lesser kuo-toa live in fear of them. 
Kuo-toa Gear. Many weapons of the kuo-toa 
are designed to capture rather than kill. Nets are 
common, though some carry pincer staffs (also called 
mancatchers) designed to trap and immobilize foes. 
Kuo-toa warriors also treat their shields with a sticky 
goo that catches incoming weapons. 
In general, kuo-toa don't like the weight of armor on 
their slippery bodies and rely on their natural rubbery 
hides for protection. However, they like to wear jewelry 
made from scavenged bones, shells, pearls, gems, and 
carapace fragments.

Amphibious. The kuo-toa can breathe air and water. 
Otherworldly Perception. The kuo-toa can sense the presence 
of any creature within 30 feet of it that is invisible or on the 
Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving. 
Slippery. The kuo-toa has advantage on ability checks and 
saving throws made to escape a grapple. 
Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the kuo-toa has 
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks that rely on sight. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage. 
Spear. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 t0 hit, reach 5 ft. or 
range 20f60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, or 
5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a 
melee attack. 
Net. Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range Sf15 ft., one Large 
or smaller creature. Hit: The target is restrained. A creature 
can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to free itself 
or another creature in a net, ending the effect on a success. 
Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) frees the target 
without harming it and destroys the net. 
REACTIONS 
Sticky Shield. When a creature misses the kuo-toa with a melee 
weapon attack, the kuo-toa uses its sticky shield to catch 
the weapon. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Strength 
saving throw, or the weapon becomes stuck to the kuo-toa's 
shield. If the weapon's wielder can't or won't let go of the 
weapon, the wielder is grappled while the weapon is stuck. 
While stuck, the weapon can't be used. A creature can pull 
the weapon free by taking an action to make a DC 11 Strength 
check and succeeding.
