Shapechanger. The mimic can use its action to polymorph into 
an object or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics 
are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or 
carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies. 
Adhesive (Object Form Only). The mimic adheres to anything 
that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the 
mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 13). Ability checks 
made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. 
False Appearance (Object Form Only). While the mimic 
remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an 
ordinary object. 
Grappler. The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any 
creature grappled by it. 
ACT IONS 
Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the mimic is in 
object form, the target is subjected to its Adhesive trait. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage. 
Mimics are shapeshifting predators able to take on 
the form of inanimate objects to lure creatures to their 
doom. In dungeons, these cunning creatures most often 
take the form of doors and chests, having learned that 
such forms attract a steady stream of prey. 
Imitative Predators. Mimics can alter their 
outward texture to resemble wood, stone, and other 
basic materials, and they have evolved to assume the 
appearance of objects that other creatures are likely to 
come into contact with. A mimic in its altered form is 
nearly unrecognizable until potential prey blunders into 
its reach, whereupon the monster sprouts pseudopods 
and attacks. 
When it changes shape, a mimic excretes an adhesive 
that helps it seize prey and weapons that touch it. 
The adhesive is absorbed when the mimic assumes 
its amorphous form and on parts the mimic uses to 
move itself. 
· Cunning Hunters. Mimics live and hunt alone, though 
they occasionally share their feeding grounds with other 
creatures. Although most mimics have only predatory 
intelligence, a rare few evolve greater cunning and the 
ability to carry on simple conversations in Common or 
Undercommon. Such mimics might allow safe passage 
through their domains or provide useful information in 
exchange for food.

MIND FLAYER 
Mind fiayers, also called illithids, are the scourge of 
sentient creatures across countless worlds. Psionic 
tyrants, slavers, and interdimensional voyagers, they 
are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races for 
their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their 
octopus-like heads, flexing in hungry anticipation when 
sentient creatures come near. 
In eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned 
many worlds. They subjugated and consequently warped 
whole races of humanoid slaves, including the githyanki 
and githzerai, the grimlocks, and the kuo-toa. Conjoined 
by a collective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots 
as far-reaching and evil as their fathomless minds 
can conceive. 
Since the fall of their empires, illithid collectives on 
the Material Plane have resided in the Underdark. 
Psionic Commanders. Mind fiayers possess psionic 
powers that enable them to control the minds of 
creatures such as troglodytes, grimlocks, quaggoths, 
and ogres. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy 
and use their telepathy when issuing commands to 
their thralls. 
When an illithid meets strong resistance, it avoids 
initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like 
physical extensions of the illithid's thoughts, these 
thralls interpose themselves between the mind 
fiayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their 
master can escape. 
Hive Mind Colonies. Solitary mind fiayers are likely 
rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony 
of sibling mind fiayers devoted to an elder brain- a 
massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool 
near the center of a mind fiayer community. From its 
pool, an elder brain telepathically dictates its desires to 
each individual mind fiayer within 5 miles of it, for it is 
able to hold multiple mental conversations at once. 
Hunger of the Mind. Illithids subsist on the brains 
of humanoids. The brains provide enzymes, hormones, 
and psychic energy necessary for their survival. An 
illithid healthy from a brain-rich diet secretes a thin 
glaze of mucus that coats its mauve skin. 
An illithid experiences euphoria as it devours 
the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories, 
personality, and innermost fears. Mind fiayers will 
sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it 
as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into 
an intellect devourer. 
QUA LITH 
On the rare occasion that mind flayers need to write 
something down, they do so in Qualith. This system of 
tactile writing (similar to braille) is read by an illithid's 
tentacles. Qualith is written in four-line stanzas and is so 
alien in construction that non-illithids must resort to magic 
to discern its meaning. Though Qualith can be used to keep 
records, illithids most often use it to mark portals or other 
surfaces with warnings or instructions.
