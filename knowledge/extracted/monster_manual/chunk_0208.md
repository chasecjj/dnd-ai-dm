SPRITE 
In secret groves and shaded glens, tiny sprites with 
dragonfly wings flutter. For all their fey splendor, 
however, sprites lack warmth and compassion. They are 
aggressive and hardy warriors, taking severe measures 
to ward strangers away from their homes. Interlopers 
that come too close have their moral character judged, 
then are put to sleep or frightened off. 
Forest Protectors. Sprites build little villages in the 
boughs of trees and willing treants, in verdant glades 
brightened by moss, wild flowers, and toadstools. Wild 
nature thrives, and the sprites allow no trespassers. 
When intruders are spotted, the sprites lead them astray 
with ominous rustling from the bushes and distant 
snapping twigs. Creatures foolish enough to persist in 
intruding on a sprite's territory are stung with poisoned 
arrows and lulled into a senseless sleep. While they 
slumber, the sprites make good their escape, retreating 
to an even more secluded area of the forest. 
Heart Seers. Sprites can sense whether a creature 
is good or evil by the sound and feeling of its beating 
heart. Weighing the balance of a creature's past actions, 
a sprite can tell whether its heart beats rapidly in love 
or flags in sorrow, or whether it is darkened by hate or 
greed. The sprite's power to perceive the heart always 
shows the truth, because the heart can't lie. 
Poison Brewers. In their forest domains, sprites brew 
toxins, unguents, antidotes, and poisons, including the 
sleep poison with which they coat their arrows. They 
venture .far into the woods to harvest rare flowers, 
mosses, and fungi, sometimes crossing dangerous 
territory to do so. If desperate, sprites even steal their 
ingredients from the gardens of hags. 
Good-Hearted. Because they are judges of the heart 
and favor good creatures, sprites oppose the will of evil 
fey and pledge to thwart evil archfey at every turn. If 
they encounter adventurers on a quest to rid their forest 
of an evil fey creature or goblinoid menace, they will 
pledge their support and even come to their aid when 
the adventurers least expect it. 
Unlike pixies, sprites rarely indulge in frivolous 
merriment and fun. They are firm warriors, protectors, 
and judges, and their stern bent causes other fey to 
consider them overly dour and serious. However, fey 
that respect the sprites' territory find them staunch 
allies in times of trouble.

Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 1 slashing damage. 
Shortbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 40/160 
ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must 
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become 
poisoned for l minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, 
the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, 
or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to 
shake it awake. 
Heart Sight. The sprite touches a creature and magically knows 
the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 
l 0 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's 
alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the 
saving throw. 
Invisibility. The sprite magically turns invisible until it 
attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if 
concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or 
carries is invisible with it.
