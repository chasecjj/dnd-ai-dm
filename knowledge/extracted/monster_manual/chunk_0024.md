:Awakened plants gifted with the powers of 
intelligence and mobility, blights plague 
lands contaminated by darkness. Drinking 
that darkness from the soil, a blight carries 
out the will of ancient evil and attempts to 
spread that evil wherever it can. 
Roots of the Gulthias Tree. Legends 
tell of a vampire named Gulthias who 
worked terrible magic and raised up 
an abominable tower called Nightfang 
Spire. Gulthias was undone when a 
hero plunged a wooden stake through 
his heart, but as the vampire was 
destroyed, his blood infused the stake 
with a dreadful power. In time, tendrils 
of new growth sprouted from the wood, 
growing into a sapling infused with the 
vampire's evil essence. It is said that 
a mad druid discovered the sapling, 
transplanting it to an underground grotto 
where it could grow. From this Gulthias 
tree came the seeds from which the first 
blights were sown. 
Dark Conquest. Wherever a tree or plant 
is contaminated by a fragment of an evil mind 
or po~er, a Gulthias tree can rise to infest and 
corrupt the surrounding forest. Its evil spreads 
through root and soil to other plants, which perish 
or transform into blights. As those blights spread, 
they poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them 
with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. 
In time, an infestation of blights can turn any land or 
forest into a place of corruption. 
In forests infested with blights, trees and 
plants grow with supernatural speed. Vines and 
undergrowth rapidly spread through buildings and 
overrun trails and roads. After blights have killed 
or driven off their inhabitants, whole villages can 
disappear in the space of days. 
Controlled by Evil. Blights are independent 
creatures, but most act under a Gulthias tree's control, 
often displaying the habits and traits of the life force or 
spirit that spawned them. By attacking their progenitor's 
old foes or seeking out treasures valuable to it, they 
carry on the legacy of long-lost evil. 
NEEDLE BLIGHT 
In the shadows of a forest, needle blights might 
be taken at a distance for shuffling, hunched 
humanoids. Up close, these creatures reveal 
themselves as horrid plants whose conifer-like 
needles grow across their bodies in quivering 
clumps. A needle blight lashes out with these 
needles or launches them as an aerial assault that 
can punch through armor and flesh. 
When needle blights detect a threat, they loose a 
pollen that the wind carries to other needle blights 
throughout the forest. Alerted to their foes' location, 
needle blights converge from all sides to drench their 
roots in blood.

TWIG BLIGHT 
Twig blights can root in soil, which they do when living 
prey are scarce. While rooted, they resemble woody 
shrubs. When it pulls its roots free of the ground to 
move, a twig blight's branches twist together to form a 
humanoid-looking body with a head and limbs. 
Twig blights seek out campsites and watering holes, 
rooting there to set up ambushes for potential victims 
coming to drink or rest. Huddled together in groups, 
twig blights blend in with an area's natural vegetation or 
with piles of debris or firewood. 
Given how dry they are, twig blights are particularly 
susceptible to fire. 
VINE BLIGHT 
Appearing as masses of slithering creepers, vine blights 
hide in undergrowth and wait for prey to draw near. By 
animating the plants around them, vine blights entangle 
and hinder their foes before attacking. 
Vine blights are the only blights capable of speech. 
Through its connection to the evil spirit of the Gulthias 
tree it serves, a vine blight speaks in a fractured version 
of its dead master's voice, taunting victims or bargaining 
with powerful foes.

Entangling Plants (Recharge 5-6). Grasping roots and vines 
sprout in a 15-foot radius centered on the blight, withering 
away after 1 minute. For the duration, that area is difficult 
terrain for non plant creatures. In addition, each creature 
of the blight's choice in that area when the plants appear 
must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or become 
restrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 
Strength check, freeing itself or another entangled creature 
within reach on a success.
