NAG AS 
Nagas are intelligent serpents that inhabit the ruins of 
the past, amassing arcane treasures and knowledge. 
The first nagas were created as immortal guardians 
by a humanoid race long lost to history. When this race 
died out, the nagas deemed themselves the rightful 
inheritors of their masters' treasures and magical lore. 
Industrious and driven, nagas occasionally venture 
out from their lairs to track down magic items or 
rare spellbooks. 
Nagas never feel the ravages of time or succumb to 
sickness. Even if it is struck down, a naga's immortal 
spirit reforms in a new body in a matter of days, ready to 
continue its eternal work. 
Benevolent Dictators and Brutal Tyrants. A naga 
rules its domain with absolute authority. Whether it 
rules with compassion or by terrorizing its subjects, the 
naga believes itself the master of all other creatures that 
inhabit its domain. 
Rivalry. Nagas have a long-standing enmity with the 
yuan-ti, with each race seeing itself as the epitome of 
serpentine evolution. Though cooperation between 
them is rare, nagas and yuan-ti sometimes set aside 
their differences to work toward common objectives. 
However, yuan-ti always chafe under a naga's authority. 
Immortal Nature. A naga doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
BONE NAGA 
In response to the long history of conflict between the 
yuan-ti and the nagas, yuan-ti created a necromantic 
ritual that could halt a naga's resurrection by 
transforming the living naga into a skeletal undead 
servitor. A bone naga retains only a few of the spells it 
knew in life. 
GUARDIAN NAGA 
Wise and good, the beautiful guardian nagas protect 
sacred places and items of magical power from falling 
into evil hands. In their hidden redoubts, they research 
spells and hatch convoluted plots to thwart the evil 
designs of their enemies. 
A guardian naga doesn't seek out violence, warning off 
intruders rather than attacking. Only if its foes persist 
does the naga attack, accosting enemies with its spells 
and poisonous spittle. 
SPIRIT NAGA 
Spirit nagas live in gloom and spitefulness, constantly 
plotting vengeance against creatures that have wronged 
them- or that they believe have wronged them. Lairing 
in dismal caverns and ruins, they devote their time to 
developing new spells and enslaving the mortals with 
which they surround themselves. A spirit naga likes to 
charm its foes, drawing them close so that it can sink its 
poisonous fangs into their flesh.
