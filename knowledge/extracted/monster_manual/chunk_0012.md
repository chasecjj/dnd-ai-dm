PLANETAR 
Planetars act as the weapons of the gods they serve, 
presenting a tangible representation of their deities' 
might. A planetar can call down rain to relieve a 
drought, or can loose an insect plague to devour crops. 
A planetar's celestial ears detect every falsehood, and its 
radiant eyes see through every deception. 
Planetars are muscular and hairless and have 
opalescent green skin and white-feathered wings. They 
tower over most humanoids, brandishing immense 
swords with grace. Sometimes sent to aid powerful 
mortals on important tasks for good, planetars are 
especially fond of missions that involve battling fiends.
