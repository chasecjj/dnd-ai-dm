Devil's Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's 
darkvision. 
Magic Resistance. The devil has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The devil makes three attacks: one with its bite, 
one with its claws, and one with its tail. 
Some ice devils have the following action options. 
Multiattack. The devil makes two attacks: one with its 
spear and one with its tail. 
Ice Spear. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 10 to hit, reach 10ft., 
one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) 
cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed 
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or for 1 minute, its 
speed is reduced by 10 feet; it can take either an action or a 
bonus action on each of its turns, not both; and it can't take 
reactions. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end 
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 10 to hit, reach 5 ft. , one target. 
Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 10 to hit, reach 10ft., one 
target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) 
cold damage. 
Wall of ice (Recharge 6). The devil magically forms an opaque 
wa ll of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The 
wa ll is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or 
it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter. 
When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed 
out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side 
of the wa ll to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. 
The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
The wa ll lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated 
or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot 
section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, 
and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic 
damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of 
frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature 
finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or 
otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving 
throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a fai led save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates 
when the rest of the wall vanishes.
