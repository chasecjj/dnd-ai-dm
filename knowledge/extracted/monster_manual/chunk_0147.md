KoBOLDS 
Kobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that worship 
evil dragons as demigods and serve them as minions 
and toadies. Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they 
can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering 
treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards. 
Strength in Numbers. Kobo Ids are egg-laying 
creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be 
"great wyrms" more than a century old. However, 
many kobolds perish before they reach the end of 
their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey 
for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band 
together. Their superior numbers can win battles 
against powerful adversaries, but often with massive 
casualties on the kobold side. 
Tunnelers and Builders. Kobolds make up for their 
physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making 
and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels 
through which they move easily but which hinder larger 
humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. 
The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural 
hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect 
to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-
eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant 
centipedes at intruders. 
The'Lost God. In addition to the dragons they revere, 
kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. 
Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's 
vassal in the Nine Hells until Gar! Glittergold, the god 
of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragori Queen's 
hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket,

but Gar! Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the 
earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground 
maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes 
and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted 
worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing 
their lost god from his prison-maze. 
Winged Kobolds. A few kobo Ids are born with 
leathery wings and can fly. Known 
as urds, they like to lurk on high 
ledges and drop rocks 
on passersby. Although 
the urds' wings are seen 
as gifts from Tiamat, the 
D~agon Queen, wingless 
kobolds are envious of 
those gifts and don't get 
along with the urds.
