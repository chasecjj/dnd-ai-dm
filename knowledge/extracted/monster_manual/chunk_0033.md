Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed 
on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw against being magically 
petrified. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone 
and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of 
its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the 
creature is petrified for 24 hours. 
COCKATRICE 
COCKATRICE 
The cockatrice looks like a hideous hybrid of lizard, 
bird, and bat, and it is infamous for its ability to turn 
flesh to stone. These omnivores have a diet that consists 
of berries, nuts, flowers, and small animals such as 
insects, mice, and frogs- things they can swallow 
whole. They would be no threat to anything else if not 
for their fierce and frenzied response to even a hint of 
danger. A cockatrice flies into the face of any threat, 
squawking and madly beating its wings as its head darts 
out to peck. The smallest scratch from a cockatrice's 
beak can spell doom as its victim slowly turns to stone 
from the injury.

Innate Spellcasting. The couatl's spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following 
spells, requiring only verbal components: 
At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect thoughts 
3jday each: bless, create food and water, cure wounds, lesser 
restoration, protection from poison, sanctuary, shield 
1jday each: dream, greater restoration, scrying 
Magic Weapons. The couatl's weapon attacks are magical. 
Shielded Mind. The couatl is immune to scrying and to any 
effect that would sense its emotions, read its thoughts, or 
detect its location. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed 
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 
24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target is unconscious. 
Another creature can use an action to shake the target awake. 
Constrict. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10ft., one 
Medium or smaller creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning 
damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this 
grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the couatl can't 
constrict another target. 
Change Shape. The couatl magically polymorphs into a 
humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or 
less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its 
true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is 
absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl's choice). 
In a· new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and 
ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, 
Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new 
form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class 
features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new 
form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the 
couatl can use its bite in that form. 
COUATL 
Couatls are benevolent serpentine beings of great 
intellect and insight. Their brilliantly colored wings and 
gentle manner speak to their celestial origins. 
Divine Caretakers. Couatls were created as 
guardians and caretakers by a benevolent god not 
worshiped since the dawn of time, and which is 
forgotten now by all but the couatls themselves. Most of 
the divine mandates given to these beings are long since 
fulfilled or failed. However, a number of couatls still 
watch over ancient power, await fulfillment of prophecy, 
or safeguard the heirs of creatures they once guided 
and protected. Regardless of a couatl's task, it prefers to 
remain hidden, revealing itself only as a last resort. 
Truth Tellers. A couatl can't lie, but it can withhold 
information, answer questions vaguely, or allow 
others to jump to the wrong conclusions if doing so is 
necessary to protect something, to keep promises, or to 
hide the secret of its existence. 
Ancient and Few. A couatl can live for ages without 
li)ustenance, even surviving without air, but these 
creatures can die of disease or the passage of time. A 
couatl can sense its end up to a century beforehand, but 
it has no insight into the manner of its demise. 
If a couatl has already accomplished what it set out 
to do, it accepts its fate. However, if its imminent death 
endangers the completion of its goals, it actively seeks 
out another couatl with which to produce offspring. 
The mating ritual of couatls is a beautiful and 
elaborate dance of magic and light, which results in 
a gem-like egg from which a new couatl hatches. The . 
parent that sought out the mate raises the newborn 
couatl and instructs it as to its duties, so that it can 
complete whatever task the parent leaves unfinished.
