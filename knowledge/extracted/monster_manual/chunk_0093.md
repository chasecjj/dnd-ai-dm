DRIDER 
When a drow shows great promise, Lolth summons it 
to the Demonweb Pits for a test of faith and strength. 
Those that pass the test rise higher in the Spider 
Queen's favor. Those that fail are transformed into 
driders- a horrid hybrid of a drow and a giant spider 
that serves as a living reminder of Lolth's power. Only 
drow can be turned into driders, and the power to create 
these creatures resides with Lolth alone. 
Scarred for Life. Drow transformed into driders 
return to the Material Plane as twisted and debased 
creatures. Driven by madness, they disappear into 
the Underdark to become hermits and hunters, either 
wandering alone or leading packs of giant spiders. 
On rare occasion, a drider returns to the fringes of 
drow society despite its curse, most often to fulfill some 
longstanding vow or vendetta from its former life. Drow 
fear and shun the driders, holding them in lower esteem 
than slaves. However, they tolerate the presence of_ 
these creatures as living representatives of Lolth's will, 
and a reminder of the fate that awaits all who fail the 
Spider Queen. 
VARIANT: DRIDER SPELLCASTINC 
Driders that were once drow spellcasters might retain their 
ability to cast spells. Such driders typically have a higher 
spellcasting ability (l 5 or 16) than other driders. Further, the 
drider gains the Spell casting trait. A drider that was a drow 
divine spellcaster, therefore, could have a Wisdom of 16 (+3) 
and a Spellcasting trait as follows. 
Spellcasting. The drider is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its 
spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to 
hit with spell attacks) . The drider has the following spells 
prepared from the cleric spell list: 
Cantrips (at will): poison spray, thaumaturgy 
1st level (4 slots): bane, detect magic, sanctuary 
2nd level (3 slots): hold person, silence 
3rd level (3 slots): clairvoyance, dispel magic 
1 4th level (2 slots): divination ,freedom of movement
