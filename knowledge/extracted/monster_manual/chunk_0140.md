HIPPO GRIFF 
A beast whose magical origins are lost to history, a 
hippogriff possesses the wings and forelimbs of an 
eagle, the hindquarters of a horse, and a head that 
combines the features of both animals. 
Reclusive and omnivorous, hippogriffs mate for life 
and seldom venture more than a few miles from their 
nest. When defending its mate or its young, a hippogriff 
fights to the death. Hippogriffs don't lay eggs but give 
birth to live young. 
Dragons, griffons, and wyverns have a taste for 
hippogriff meat and frequently prey on these creatures. 
Flying Mounts. A hippogriff raised in captivity can be 
trained to be a faithful companion and mount. Of all the 
creatures that can serve as flying mounts, hippogriffs 
are among the easiest to train and the most loyal once 
trained properly.

War horns sound, stones fly from catapults, and the 
thunder of a thousand booted feet echoes across 
the land as hobgoblins march to battle. Across the 
borderlands of civilization, settlements and settlers 
must contend with these aggressive humanoids, whose 
thirst for conquest is never satisfied. 
Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and 
hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow 
or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling 
brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed 
teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red 
nose, which symbolizes virility and power among 
goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, 
though their love of warfare and battle means 
that few do. 
Goblinoids. Hobgoblins belong to a family of 
creatures called goblinoids. They are often found 
lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the 
ferocious bugbears. 
Martial Might. A hobgoblin measures virtue by 
physical strength and martial prowess, caring about 
nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill 
and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military 
rank attain their positions by force, then hold those 
positions by imposing the i~ authority through 
draconian measures. 
Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, 
and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege 
engines, and other. military devices. Organized and 
disciplined, they take exceptional care oftheir weapons, 
armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold 
colors associated with their tribes, and trim their 
often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and 
leather dyed black. 
Military Legions. Hobgoblins organize themselves 
into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial 
society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful 
leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot 
soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven 
into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed 
by a warlord with several captains serving under its 
command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant 
more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, 
and dominion than leading troops into battle. 
As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their 
own legion, rival legions compete constantly for 
reputation and status. Meetings between legions 
erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only 
exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to 
cooperate on the battlefield. 
Strategic Thinkers. Hobgoblins have a strong grasp 
of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated 
battle plans under the direction of a strategically 
minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack 
them first in battle over any other opponents, even if 
doing so would be a tactical error. 
Legions often supplement their ranks with less 
reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, 
bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.
