BULLYWUG 
Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-
headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly 
moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp 
caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs 
overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when 
they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for 
easier prey. 
Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin 
that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown, 
allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. They 
wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and can 
deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close. 
Foul Aristocracy. Bullywugs consider themselves 
the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow 
an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and 
each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their 
leader- a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce 
themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows 
of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, 
and endlessly vie to win their superiors' favor. 
A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. 
It can either murder its rivals, though it must take 
pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find 
a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a 
token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders 
its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so 
it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against 
caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing 
precious baubles to impress their lords and win their 
good graces. Invariably, such fine goods.are reduced 
to filthy tatters throug.h abuse and neglect. Once a gift 
loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that 
its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute. 
Unruly Diplomacy. Bullywugs love nothing more than 
lording over those who trespass on their territories. 
Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than 
simply slaying them. 
Captives are dragged before the king or queen-a 
bullywug of unusually large size- and forced to beg 
for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the 
bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before 
it tries to impress its "guests" with the majesty of its 
treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority 
complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings 
and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect 
of outsiders. 
Amphibian Allies. Bullywugs speak a language 
that allows them to communicate over large areas by 
croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events 
in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude 
communication system. 
Simple concepts in the language are understandable 
to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to 
form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train 
as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are 
sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability 
to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug 
hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to 
their villages.
