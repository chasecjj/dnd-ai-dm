BANSHEE 
When night falls, unlucky travelers hear the faint cries 
of the forlorn dead. This woeful spirit is a banshee, a 
spiteful creature formed from the spirit of a female elf. 
Banshees appear as luminous, wispy forms that 
vaguely recall their mortal features. A banshee's face is 
wreathed in a wild tangle of hair, its body clad in wispy 
rags that flutter and stream around it. 
Divine Wrath. Banshees are the undead remnants of 
elves who, blessed with great beauty, failed to use their 
gift to bring joy to the world. Instead, they used their 
beauty to corrupt and control others. Elves afflicted by 
the banshee's curse experience no gladness, feeling 
only distress in the presence of the Jiving. As the curse 
takes its toll, their minds and bodies decay, until death 
completes their transformation into undead monsters. 
Sorrow Bound. A banshee becomes forever bound to 
the place of its demise, unable to venture more than five 
miles from there. It is forced to relive every momerit of 
its life ~ith perfect recall, yet always refuses to accept 
responsibility for. its doom. 
Beauty Hoarders. The vanity that inspired the 
banshee's cursed creatipn persists in undeath. These 
creatures covet beautiful objects: fine je~elry, paintings, 
statues, and other objects of art. At the same time, a 
banshee abhors any mirrored surface, for it can't bear to 
c 
see the horror_ of its own existence. A single glimpse of 
\ 
itself is enough to send a banshee into a rage. 
) 
Undead Nature. A banshee doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep.
