Fire giants shun cold as much as their cousins 
the frost giants hate heat. They can adapt to cold 
environments with effort, though, keeping their hearth 
fires burning bright and wearing heavy woolen clothing 
and furs to stay warm. 
Martial Experts. From birth, a fire giant is taught 
to embrace a legacy of war. At the cradle, its parents 
chant songs of battle. As children, fire giants play at 
war, hurling igneous rocks at one another across the 
banks of magma rivers. In later years, formal martial 
training becomes an integral part of life in the giants' 
fortresses and underground realms of smoke and ash. 
The fire giants' songs are odes of battles lost and won, 
while their dances are martial formations of pounding 
feet that resound like smiths' hammers throughout their 
smoky halls. 
Just as fire giants pass down their knowledge of 
crafting from generation to generation, their renowned 
fighting prowess comes not from wild fury but from 
endless discipline and training. Enemies make the 
mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their 
brutish manner, learning too late that these giants live 
for combat and can be shrewd tacticians. 
Feudal Lords. Humanoids conquered in war become 
serfs to the fire giants. The serfs work the farms and 
fields on the outskirts of fire giant halls and fortresses, 
raising livestock and harvesting fields whose bounty is 
almost entirely tithed to the fire giant kings. 
Fire giant crafters work through insight and 
experience rather than writing or arithmetic. Though 
most fire giants place little worth on such frivolousness 
they sometimes keep slaves at court who. are versed 
' 
in such skills. Serfs not destined for court or the 
fields (especially dwarves) are taken to the fire giants' 
mountainous realms to mine ore and gemstones from 
deep within the earth. 
Fire giants low in the ordning manage the mine 
tunnels and the slaves that toil there, few of which 
survive the difficult and dangerous work for long. 
Though fire giants are skilled in the engineering of 
mine tunnels and the gathering of ore, they place 
less importance on the safety of their slaves than on 
smelting and working the bounty those slaves produce. 
Skilled Artisans. Fire giants have a fearsome 
reputation as soldiers and conquerors, and for their 
ability to burn, plunder, and destroy. Yet among the 
giants, fire giants produce the greatest crafters and 
artists. They excel at smelting and smith work, as they 
do at the engineering of metal and stone, and the quality 
of their artistry shows even in their implements of 
destruction and their weapons of war. 
Fire giants strive to build the strongest fortresses and 
most potent siege weapons. They experiment with alloys 
to create the hardest armor, then forge the swords that 
can pierce it. Such work requires brawn and brains in 
equal measure, and fire giants high in the ordning tend 
to be the smartest and strongest of their kind.

fliNT WARS 
FROST GIANT 
Gigantic reavers from the freezing lands beyond 
civilization, frost giants are fierce, hardy warriors 
that survive on the spoils of their raids and pillaging. 
They respect only brute strength and skill in battle, 
demonstrating both with their scars and the grisly 
trophies they take from their enemies. 
H~arts of lee. Frost giants are creatures of ice ar1d 
snow. Their hair and beards are pale white or light blue, 
matted with frost and clattering with icicles. Their .flesh 
is as blue as glacial ice. 
Frost giants dwell in high peaks and glacial rifts 
where the sun hides its golden head by winter. Crops 
don't grow in their frozen homelands, and they keep 
little livestock beyond what they capture in their raids 
against civilized lands. They hunt the wild game of the 
tundra and mountains but don't cook it, since meat from 
a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate. 
Reavers of the Storm. The war horns of the frost 
giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses 
and glacial rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that 
storm clears, villages and steadings lay in ruins, ravens 
descending to feed on the corpses of any creatures 
foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants' path. 
Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, 
their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead 
gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and 
steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses 
of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers 
have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize 
gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. 
However, even those treasures are most often saved for 
trading opportunities with other giants more adept at 
crafting metal weapons and armor. 
Rulers by Might. Frost giants respect brute strength 
above all else, and a frost giant's place in the ordning 
depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior 
musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies 
fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such 
as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants 
based on their physical strength and hardiness. 
When frost giants of different clans meet and their 
status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such 
meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer 
on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. 
At other times, the informal ceremony can become a 
chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee 
that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and 
causes avalanches on the snowy mountainsides. 
Make War, Not Goods. Though frost giants consider 
the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and 
leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing 
from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or 
ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. 
They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, 
stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword 
blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The 
greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, 
and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon 
scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon's 
teeth or claws.
