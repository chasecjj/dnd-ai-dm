~NVlSIBLE STALKER 
INVISIBLE STALKER 
An invisible stalker is an air elemental that has been 
summoned from its native plane and transformed 
by powerful magic. Its sole purpose is to hunt down 
creatures and retrieve objects for its summoner. When 
it is defeated or the magic that binds it expires, an 
invisible stalker vanishes in a gust of wind. 
Directed Hunter. When an invisible stalker is created, 
it stays at its summoner's side until it is given a task to 
perform. If an assignment doesn't involve hunting down 
. and slaying a specific creature or recovering an object, 
the magic that created the invisible stalker ends and 
the elemental is released. Otherwise, it completes the 
task, then returns to its summoner for more commands, 
forced to serve until the magic that binds it expires. If 
its summoner dies in the interim, the invisible stalker 
vanishes after completing its task. 
An invisible stalker is an unwilling servant at best. 
It resents any undertaking assigned to it. A mission 
that requires significant time might drive the invisible 
stalker to pervert the intent of a command unless it is 
worded carefully. 
Unseen Threat. Invisible stalkers are composed of air 
and are naturally invisible. A creature might hear and 
feel an invisible stalker in passing, but the elemental 
remains invisible even when it attacks. A spell that 
allows someone to see the invisible reveals only the 
invisible stalker's vague outline. 
Elemental Nature. An invisible stalker requires no 
air, food, drink, or sleep.

Shapechanger. The jackalwere can use its action to polymorph 
into a specific Medium human or a jackal-humanoid hybrid, or 
back into its true form (that of a Small jackal). Other than its 
size, its statistics are the same in each form . Any equipment 
it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true 
form if it dies. 
jACKAL WERE 
Ordinary jackals tainted by demonic power,jackalweres 
haunt roads and trails, waylaying and murdering 
those they meet. 
Ajackalwere has three physical forms that it shifts 
between. In its true form, it is indistinguishable 
from a normal jackal. It can take human form, often 
appearing gaunt and affecting a wretched demeanor to 
beg goodwill from strangers. When travelers welcome 
a jackal were into their midst, the monster adopts its 
human-sjzed hybrid form, with the fur and head of a 
jackal but standing on two legs as it attacks. 
Beguilers and Cowards. The demon lord Graz'zt 
created jackalweres to serve his devoted servants, the 
lamias. Reaching out from the Abyss, he bestowed 
jackals with the gift of speech and the ability to assume 
humanoid forms. Ajackalwere is born to lie, and 
perceptive creatures might notice it wincing in pain 
when it speaks the truth. 
A jackalwere prefers to fight alongside jackals and 
others of its kind. Under the direction of jackalweres, 
jackals are fierce and loyal companions. 
Supernatural Servants. Jackalweres kidnap 
humanoids for their lamia masters, condemning 
victims to'a lifetime of slavery or an agonizing death. A 
jackalwere's magical gaze renders a foe unconscious, 
allowing the monster to bind a creature or drag it away. 
Ajackalwere might also use its gaze to incapacitate a 
deadly enemy long enough to make good its escape. 
Keen Hearing and Smell. The jackalwere has advantage on 
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. 
Pack Tactics. The jackalwere has advantage on an attack roll 
against a creature if at least one of the jackalwere's allies is 
within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated. 
ACTIONS 
Bite ljackal or Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to 
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage . 
Scimitar (Human or Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon 
Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (ld6 + 2) 
slashing damage. 
Sleep Gaze. The jackalwere gazes at one creature it can see 
within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 10 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the target succumbs to a 
magical slumber, falling unconscious for 10 minutes or until 
someone uses an action to shake the target awake. A creature 
that successfully saves against the effect is immune to this 
jackalwere's gaze for the next 24 hours. Undead and creatures 
immune to being charmed aren't affected by it.
