Tfie inanimateJ' gargoyles that perch atop great buildings 
are inspired by these malevolent creatures of elemental 
earth that resemble grotesque, fiendish statues. A 
gargoyle lurks among masonry and ruins, as still as 
any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates 
when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the 
pain it inflicts on its victims. 
Animate Stone. Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and 
mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. 
They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among 
the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and 
cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that 
they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for 
years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry. 
Deadly Reputation. Gargoyles have a reputation for 
cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles 
appear in the architecture of countless cultures to 
frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures 
are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among 
them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle 
might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching 
and tormenting birds or rodents, but its long wait only 
increases its craving for harming sentient creatures. 
Cruel Servants. Gargoyles are easily inspired by 
the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple 
tasks such as guarding a master's home, torturing 
and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves 
minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage. 
Gargoyles sometimes serve demons for their 
propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful 
spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle guardians to 
keep watch over their gates and walls. Gargoyles have 
the patience and fortitude of stone, and will serve even 
the cruelest master for years without complaint. 
Elemental Nature. A gargoyle doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep. 
SHARDS OF ELEMENTAL EVIL 
As Ogremoch, the evil Prince of Elemental Earth, treads 
his stony realm, it leaves shards of broken rock in his wake. 
Imbued with slivers of sentience, these shards thrum with 
. the essence of the elemental prince, growing over long years 
into vaguely humanoid rock formations that resolve at last 
into the hard, cruel shapes of gargoyles. 
Ogremoch doesn't create gargoyles deliberately, but 
they are a physical manifestation of his evil. Gargoyles are 
mockeries of the elemental air that Ogremoch despises. They 
are heavy creatures of living stone, yet capable of flight. Like 
their creator, they possess a fundamental hatred for beings 
of elemental air, aarakocra in particular, and relish every 
opportunity to destroy such creatures. 
On their home plane, gargoyles carve out earth motes that 
Ogremoch hurtles into Aaqa, the domain of the aarakocra 
and the benevolent Wind Dukes the bird folk serve in the
