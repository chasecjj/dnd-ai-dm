MYCONIDS 
Myconids are intelligent, ambulatory fungi that live 
in the Underdark, seek enlightenment, and deplore 
violence. If approached peacefully, myconids gladly 
provide shelter or allow safe passage through 
their colonies. 
Circles and Melds. The largest myconid in a colony 
is its sovereign, which presides over one or more social 
groups called circles. A circle consists of twenty or more 
myconids that work, live, and meld together. 
A meld is a form of communal meditation that 
allows myconids to transcend their dull subterranean 
existence. The myconids' rapport spores bind the 
participants into a group consciousn~ss. Hallucination 
spores then induce a shared dream that provides 
entertainment and social interaction. Myconids consider 
melding to be the purpose of their existence. They use 
it in the pursuit of higher consciousness, collective 
union, and spiritual apotheosis. Myconids also use their 
rapport spores to communicate telepathically with other 
sentient creatures. 
Myconid Reproduction. Like other fungi, myconids 
reproduce by mundane sporing. They carefully control 
their spores' release to avoid overpopulation.

Distress Spores. When the myconid takes damage, all other 
myconids within 240 feet of it can sense its pain.

dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.

Rapport Spores (3jDay). A 10-foot radius of spores extends 
from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and 
affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that 
aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures 
can communicate telepathically with one another while they are 
within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.

The following characteristics change or are added to a 
creature that becomes a spore servant. 
Retained Characteristics. The servant retains its 
Armor Class, hit points, Hit Dice, Strength, Dexterity, 
Constitution, vulnerabilities, resistances, and imml!nities. 
Lost Characteristics. The servant loses its original 
saving throw and skill bonuses, special senses, and 
special traits. It loses any action that isn't Multiattack or 
a melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, 
or slashing damage. If it has an action or a melee weapon 
attack that deals some other type of damage, it loses the 
ability to deal damage of that type, unless the damage 
comes from a piece of equipment, such as a magic item. 
Type. The servant's type is plant, and it loses any tags. 
Alignment. The servant is unaligned. 
Speed. Reduce all the servant's speeds by 10 feet, to a 
minimum of 5 feet. 
Ability Scores. The servant's ability scores change as 
follows: Int 2 (-4), Wis 6 (- 2), Cha 1 (-5). 
Senses. The servant has blindsight with a radius of 
30 feet, and it is blind beyond this radius. 
Condition Immunities. The servant can't be blinded, 
charmed, frightened, or paralyzed. 
Languages. The servant loses all known languages, 
but it responds to orders given to it by myconids using 
rapport spores. The servant gives highest priority to 
orders received from the most powerful myconid. 
Attacks. If the servant has no other means of dealing 
damage, it can use its fists or limbs to make unarmed 
strikes. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning 
damage equal to ld4 +the servant's Strength modifier, 
or, if the servant is Large, 2d4 + its Strength modifier.
