HOMUNCULUS 
-----....,;i;l4 Condition Immunities charmed, poisoned 
Shaping a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, and 
blood, one can channel rare ritual magic to create a 
faithful, squirrel-sized companion. 
A homunculus is a construct that acts as an extension 
of its creator, with the two sharing thoughts, senses, 
and language through a mystical bond. A master can 
have only one homunculus at a time (attempts to create 
another one always fail), and when its master dies, the 
homunculus also dies. 
Shared Mind. A homunculus knows everything its 
creator knows, including all the languages the creator 
can speak and read. Likewise, everything the construct 
senses is known to its master, even over great distances, 
provided both are on the same plane. Functioning as a 
spy, a scout, an emissary, or a messenger, a homunculus 
is an invaluable servant for a spellcaster engaged in 
secret experimentation or adventuring.

Languages understands the languages of its creator but 
can't speak 
Challenge 0 (10 XP) 
Telepathic Bond. While the homunculus is on the same 
plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey 
what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate 
telepathically. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. , one creature. 
Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on 
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned fo r 1 
minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is 
instead poisoned for 5 (1d10) minutes and unconscious while 
poisoned in this way.
