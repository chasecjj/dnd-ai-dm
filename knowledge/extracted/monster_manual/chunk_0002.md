INTRODUCTION 
his bestiary is for storytellers and world-
builders. If you have ever thought about 
running a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game 
for your friends, either a single night's 
adventure or a long-running campaign, 
this tome contains page after page of 
inspiration. It's your one-stop shop for 
creatures both malevolent and benign. 
Some of the creatures that inhabit the worlds of 
D&D have origins rooted in real-world mythology and 
fantasy literature. Other creatures are D&D originals. 
The monsters in this book have been culled from all 
previous editions of the game. Herein you'll discover 
classic critters such as the beholder and the displacer 
beast next to more recent creations such as the chuul 
and the twig blight. Common beasts mingle with the 
weird, the terrifying, and the ridiculous. In collecting 
.mons~ers from the past, we've endeavored to reflect the 
multifaceted nature of the game, warts and all. D&D 
monsters come in all shapes and sizes, with stories that 
not only thrill us but also make us smile. 
If you're an experienced Dungeon Master (DM), a few 
of th<'; monster write-ups might surprise you, for we've 
gone into the Monster Manuals of yore and discovered 
some long-lost factoids. We've also added a few new 
twists. Naturally, you can do with these monsters what 
you will. Nothing we say here is intended to curtail 
your creativity. If the minotaurs in your world are 
shipbuilders and pirates, who are we to argue with you? 
>It's your world, after all. 
How TO UsE THIS BooK 
The best thing about being a DM is that you get to invent 
your own fantasy world and bring it to life, and nothing 
brings a D&D world to life more than the creatures 
that inhabit it. You might read a monster's entry and 
be spurred to create an adventure revolving around it, 
or you might have an awesome idea for a dungeon and 
·need just the right monsters to populate it. That's where 
the Monster Manual comes in handy. 
The Monster Manual is one of three books that form 
the foundation of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, 
the other two being the Player's Handbook and the 
Dungeon Master's Guide. The Monster Manual, like 
the Dungeon Master's Guide, is a book for DMs. Use it 
to populate your D&D adventures with pesky goblins, 
stinky troglodytes, savage orcs, mighty dragons, and a 
veritable horde of creepy crawlies. 
Guidelines for creating encounters with monsters can 
be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide. That book also 
contains wandering monster tables and other goodies 
to help you use the monsters in this book in interesting 
ways, as well as advice for modifying monsters and 
creating your own. 
If you've never run a D&D adventure before, we 
recommend that you pick up the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 
Starter Set, which demonstrates how to take a bunch of 
monsters and build an exciting adventure around them. 
WHAT Is A MoNSTER? 
A monster is defined as any creature that can be 
interacted with and potentially fought and killed. Even 
something as harmless as a frog or as benevolent as 
a unicorn is a monster by this definition. The term 
also applies to humans, elves, dwarves, and other 
civilized folk who might be friends or rivals to the player 
characters. Most of the monsters that haunt the D&D 
world, however, are threats that are meant to be stopped: 
rampaging demons, conniving devils, soul-sucking 
undead, summoned elementals- the list goes on. 
This book contains ready-to-play, easy-to-run 
monsters of all levels, and for nearly every climate and 
terrain imaginable. Whether your adventure takes place 
in a swamp, a dungeon, or the outer planes of existence, 
there are creatures in this book to populate that 
environment. 
WHERE Do MoNSTERS DwELL? 
If you are new to the D&D game, you might not be 
familiar with the weird and wondrous places where 
monsters can be found and fought. 
DuN GEONS 
When most people think of a dungeon, images of dark 
cells with iron bars and shackles spring to mind. In 
the D&D game, the word "dungeon" takes on a broader 
meaning to include any enclosed, monster-infested 
location. Most dungeons are sprawling underground 
complexes. Here are a few other examples: 
A ruined wizard's tower atop a lonely hill riddled with 
goblin-infested tunnels 
• A pharaoh's pyramid filled with haunted crypts and 
secret treasure vaults 
• A lost city in the jungle, overgrown with vines and 
overrun with demons and demon-worshiping cultists 
The icy tomb of a frost giant king 
A filthy, labyrinthine sewer system controlled by a 
gang of wererats 
THE UNDERDARK 
There is no greater dungeon than the Underdark, the 
underworld beneath the surface world. It is a vast 
subterranean realm where monsters accustomed to 
darkness dwell. It is a place filled with lightless caverns 
connected by tunnels that wind ever downward. One 
could spend a lifetime (however brief!) exploring the 
Underdark and find such places as the following: 
A mind flayer prison or asylum, filled with mindless 
thralls and raving lunatics 
A lost dwarven necropolis containing row after row of 
dusty tombs waiting to be plundered 
• A fortified outpost br-istling with armaments, guarding 
the way to a magnificent drow city 
A subterranean rift filled with giant fungi and ruled by 
a megalomaniacal beholder or mad fomorian king 
• A chain of rocky islands on a vast, sunless sea that's 
home to aboleths and insane kuo-toa
