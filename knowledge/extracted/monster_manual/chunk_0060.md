DISPLACER BEAST 
This monstrous predator takes its name from its 
ability to displace light so that it appears to be several 
feet away from its actual location. A dis placer beast 
resembles a sleek great cat covered in blue-black fur. 
However, its otherworldly origins are clear in its six 
legs and the two tentacles sprouting from its shoulders, 
both ending in pads tipped with spiky protrusions. A 
dis placer beast's eyes glow with an awful' malevolence 
that persists even in death. 
Unseelie Origins. Displacer beasts roamed the 
twilight lands of the Feywild for ages, until they were 
captured and trained by the Unseelie Court. The 
warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to 
reinforce their ferocious and predatory nature, using 
them to hunt unicorns, pegasi, and other wondrous 
prey. However, it didn't take long for the displacer 
beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape 
their masters. 
Running and breeding freely in the Feywild, the 
displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the 
Seelie Court. With blink dog companions at their side, 
fey hunters drove these predators to the fringes of the 
Feywild, where many crossed over to the Material 
Plane. To this day, displacer beasts and blink dogs 
attack each other on sight. 
Love of the Kill. Dis placer beasts kill not just for 
food but also for sport. They target prey even when 
not hungry, often toying with their victims to entertain 
themselves until they are ready to eat. After killing 
its prey using its tentacles, a displacer beast drags 
the corpse to a quiet place where it can feed without 
distraction. 
Displacer beasts hunt alone or in small prides that 
demonstrate skill at setting ambushes. A single beast 
will strike and withdraw, luring prey into a densely 
wooded area where its packmates wait. Packs of 
displacer beasts hunting near trade roads recall the 
frequency and schedule of regular caravans, laying 
down ambushes to pick off those caravans.

Avoidance. If the displacer beast is subjected to an effect that 
allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it 
instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, 
and only half damage if it fails. 
Displacement. The displacer beast projects a magical illusion 
that makes it appear to be standing near its actual location, 
causing attack rolls against it to have disadvantage. If it is hit 
by an attack, this trait is disrupted until the end of its next 
turn. This trait is also disrupted while the displacer beast is 
incapacitated or has a speed ofO. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The displacer beast makes two attacks with its 
tentacles. 
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10ft., one 
target. Hit: 7 (ld6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) 
piercing damage. 
Prized Guards and Pets. Intelligent evil creatures 
favor dis placer beasts as pets, but a dis placer beast 
enters such an alliance only if it appears beneficial. 
A displacer beast might guard a vault or act as a 
bodyguard for a prominent individual.
