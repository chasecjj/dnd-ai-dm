THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY 
The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every 
aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler 
of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells 
with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such 
in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil 
humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, 
he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn 
command legions of subordinates. 
A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master 
of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping 
his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates 
most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser 
arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the 
Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils 
conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he 
rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip 
any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status 
as he likes. 
If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears 
in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool 
of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it 
reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells 
are destroyed forever- a fate that even Asmodeus fears. 
Archdevils. The archdevils include all the current 
and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers 
and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes 
and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them 
as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil 
is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its 
particular evil nature. 
Greater Devils. The greater devils include the pit 
fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that 
command lesser devils and attend the archdevils. 
Lesser.Devils. The lesser devils include numerous 
strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined 
devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils. 
Lemures. The lowest form of devil, lemures are 
the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted 
mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only 
permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed 
weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy 
water before it can return to life. 
Promotion and Demotion. When the soul of an evil 
mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical 
form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater 
devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser 
devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater 
devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil 
to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a 
brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories 
passing intact from one form to the next. 
Low-level promotions are typically based on need, 
such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps 
to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level 
promotions are almost always based on merit, such 
as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle 
is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it 
serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step 
at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.

Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or 
disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater 
devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which 
loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil 
can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the 
demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek 
vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive. 
No devil can promote or demote another devil that has 
not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from 
demoting each other's most powerful servants. Since all 
devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote 
any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal 
form he desires. 
THE NINE HELLS 
The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine 
separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine 
Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by 
arch devils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: 
Asmodeus, the Archduke of Ness us, the ninth layer. 
To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must 
descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. 
The most expeditious means of doing so is the River 
Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one 
layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers 
can withstand the torment and horror of that journey. 
DEVIL TRUE NAMES AND TALISMANS 
Though devils all have common names, every devil above a 
lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A 
devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed and 
ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the t~ue 
names of certain devils. 
A mortal who learns a devil's true name can use powerful 
summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and 
bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with 
the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is 
inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was 
bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice-typically someone 
the creator loved-when crafted. 
However it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material 
Plane typically resents being pressed into service. However, 
the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner 
so that the summoner's soul ends up in the Nine Hells. 
Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily 
commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do 
their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.
