Acid Absorption. Whenever the golem is subjected to acid 
damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of 
hit points equal to the acid damage dealt. 
Berserk. Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points 
or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of 
GOLEMS 
its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature 
it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, 
the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object 
smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues 
to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

that would alter its form . 
Magic Resistance. The golem has advantage on saving throws · 
against spells and other magical effects.

Multiattack. The golem makes two slam attacks. 
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a 
creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw 
or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to 
the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit 
point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the 
greater restoration spell or other magic. 
Haste (Recharge 5-6). Until the end of its next turn, the 
golem magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage 
on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam attack as a 
bonus action.
