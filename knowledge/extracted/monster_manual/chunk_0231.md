OTHER ANIMALS 
A book of this size can't contain statistics for every animal 
inhabiting your D&D campaign world. However, you can 
use the stat block of one animal to represent another easily 
enough. For example, you can use the panther statistics to 
represent a jaguar, the giant goat statistics to represent a 
buffalo, and the hawk statistics to represent a falcon.
