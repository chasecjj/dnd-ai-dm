The majestic giant elk is rare to the point that its 
appearance is often taken as a foreshadowing of an 
important event, such as the birth of a king. Legends tell 
of gods that take the form of giant elk when visiting the 
Material Plane. Many cultures therefore believe that to 
hunt these creatures is to invite divine wrath.

A giant fire beetle is a nocturnal creature that takes its 
name from a pair of glowing glands that give off light. 
Miners and adventurers prize these creatures, for a 
giant fire beetle's glands continue to shed light for ld6 
days after the beetle dies. Giant fire beetles are most 
commonly found underground and in dark forests.
