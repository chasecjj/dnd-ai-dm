DINOSAURS 
Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles 
in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial 
hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but 
they might attack to defend their young, or if startled 
or harassed. 
Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger 
varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller 
dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. 
Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that 
humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain 
valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, 
and deep fens. 
ALLOSAURUS 
The allosaurus is a predator possessing great size, 
strength, and speed. It can run down almost any prey 
over open ground, pouncing to pull creatures down with 
its wicked claws. 
ANKYLOSAURUS 
Thick armor plating covers the body of the plant-eating 
ankylosaurus, which defends itself against predators 
with a knobbed tail that delivers a devastating strike. 
Some varieties of ankylosaurus have spiked tails that 
deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage. 
PLESIOSAURUS 
A plesiosaurus is a marine dinosaur whose compact 
body is driven by powerful flippers. Predatory and 
aggressive, it attacks any creature it encounters. Its 
flexible neck accounts for a third of its total length, 
letting it twist in any direction to deliver a powerful bite. 
PTERANODON 
These flying reptiles have wingspans of 15 to 20 feet 
and typically dive for small marine prey, though they 
are opportunists and will attack any creature that 
appears edible. A pteranodon has no teeth, instead 
using its sharp beak to stab prey too large to swallow 
with one gulp. 
TRICERATOPS 
One of the most aggressive of the herbivorous 
dinosaurs, a triceratops has a skull that flares out to 
form a protective plate of bone. With its great horns 
and formidable speed, a triceratops gores and tramples 
would-be predators to death. 
TYRANNOSAURUS REX 
This enormous predator terrorizes all other creatures in 
its territory. Despite its size and weight, a tyrannosaurus 
is a swift runner. It chases anything it thinks it can eat, 
and there are few creatures it won't try to devour whole. 
While prowling for substantial prey, a tyrannosaurus 
subsists on carrion, and on any smaller creatures that 
try to dart in to steal its meal.

Pounce. If the allosaurus moves at least 30 feet straight toward 
a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, 
that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw 
or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the allosaurus can 
make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
