Confusing Gaze. When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet 
of the umber hulk and is able to see the umber hulk's eyes, the 
umber hulk can magically force it to make a DC 15 Charisma 
saving throw, unless the umber hulk is incapacitated. 
On a fai led saving throw, the creature can't take reactions 
until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine 
what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does 
UM~ER HULK 
UMBER HULK 
An abominable horror from deep beneath the earth, an 
umber hulk burrows into cave complexes, dungeons, or 
Underdark settlements in search of food. Those lucky 
enough to survive an umber hulk attack often remember 
precious little of the incident, thanks to the umber hulk's 
mind-scrambling gaze. 
Devious Delvers. Umber hulks can burrow through 
solid rock, forming new tunnels in their wake. The 
steel-hard chitin of its body can withstand the cave-ins, 
tunnel collapses, and rock falls that commonly follow it. 
Burrowing into the wall of a cavern or passageway, 
an umber hulk lies in wait for creatures to pass by 
on the other side, its hair-like feelers sensing any 
movement around it. When it explodes out in a shower 
of earth and rock, its unsuspecting quarry turns to face 
the oncoming threat-and is entranced by the umber 
hulk's bewildering eyes, forced to stand helpless as its 
mandibles snap shut. 
Mind Scrambler. Many survivors of an umber hulk 
encounter recollect little about the attack, because the 
monster's confusing gaze scrambles their memory of 
the event. Those who have fought and killed umber 
hulks recognize the signs. For other denizens of 
the Underdark, grisly tales of vanished explorers 
and wanton destruction speak of an unknown 
foe. Umber hulks take on supernatural status 
in these harrowing stories, many of which 
convey the same warning: once an umber 
hulk has been spotted, it is already too late 
to escape it. 
nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action but uses all 
its movement to move in a random direction. On a '1 or 8, the 
creature makes one melee attack against a random creature, or 
it doe.s nothing if no creature is within reach. 
Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the 
saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it 
can't see the umber hulk until the start of its next turn, when it 
can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the umber hulk 
in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. 
Tunneler. The umber hulk can burrow through solid rock at 
half its burrowing speed and leaves a 5 foot-wide, 8-foot-high 
tunnel in its wake. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The umber hulk makes three attacks: two with its 
claws and one with its mandibles. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage. 
Mandibles. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.
