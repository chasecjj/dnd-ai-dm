Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, 
and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in 
their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they 
proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into 
their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and 
power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards 
and soldiers. 
Ore Crossbreeds. Luthic, the ore goddess of fertility 
and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often 
and indiscriminately so that ore hordes swell generation 
after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs 
stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily 
crossbreed with other races. When an ore procreates 
with a non-ore humanoid of similar size and stature 
(such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is 
either an ore or a half-ore. When an ore produces young 
with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating 
strength and brutish features called an ogrillon. 
ORO WAR CHIEF 
The war chief of an ore tribe is its strongest and most 
cunning member. The reign of a war chief lasts only as 
long as it commands the fear and respect of other tribe 
members, whose bloodlust must be regularly satisfied 
lest the chief appear weak. 
Scions of Slaughter. Gruumsh bestows special 
blessings upon war chiefs who prove themselves in 
battle time and again, imbuing them with slivers of his 
savagery. A war chief so blessed finds that his weapons 
cut deeper into his enemies, allowing him to inflict 
more carnage. 
KING 0BOULD MANY-ARROWS 
1 King Obould of the Many-Arrows tribe is a legend among the 
I 
ore war chiefs of the Forgotten Realms, and he is the most 
famous ore chief in the history of the D&D game. 
Smarter and more intuitive than most of his kind, Obould 
slew his chieftain to take control of his tribe. Skilled in the 
arts of war and renowned for his violent temper, Obould 
proved himself a fierce opponent in battle time and again. 
Over the years, he subsumed other ore tribes into his own 
until he commanded a horde of thousands. 
' 
Obould leveraged his strength and influence to carve out 
a kingdom for himself in the Spine of the World, a mountain 
range overlooking numerous dwarven, human, and elven 
strongholds. 
After years of bloody conflict with his more civilized 
' neighbors, Obould did the unthinkable and brokered a 
peace treaty with his enemies. This treaty confused many 
of the orcs under Obould's command. It was either a clever 
ploy by Obould to buy time while he strengthened his army 
for a final, decisive sweep across the Savage Frontier, or it 
was a troubling sign that Obould had forsaken the ways of 
Gruumsh and needed to be destroyed .

ORO EYE OF GRUUMSH 
When an ore slays an elf in Gruumsh's name and offers 
the corpse of its foe as a sacrifice to the god of slaughter, 
an aspect of the god might appear. This aspect demands 
an. additional sacrifice: on<;! of the ore's eyes, symbolizing 
the loss Gruumsh suffered at the hands of his greatest 
enemy, Corellon Larethian. 
If the ore plucks out one of its eyes, Gruumsh might 
grant the ore spellcasting ability and special favo;, along 
with the right to call itself an Eye of Gruumsh. When 
not using their auguries to advise their war chiefs, these 
savage devotees of the god of slaughter hurl themselves 
into battle, their weapons stained with blood. 
0ROG 
Orogs are orcs blessed with a surprisingly keen intellect 
that ordinary orcs believe is a gift from the ore goddess 
Luthic. Like Luthic, orogs prefer to live underground, 
although the scarcity of food often brings them to 
the surface to hunt. Orcs respect an orog's strength 
and cunning, and a lone orog might command an 
ore war band. 
Stronger and Smarter. An orog uses its strength to 
bully other orcs and its intelligence to surprise enemies 
on the battlefield. Many an overconfident elf, human, or 
dwarf commander has watched a "simple" ore warlord 
execute a clever maneuver to outflank and destroy an 
opposing force, not realizing the ore is an orog. 
When encountered in great numbers, orogs form their 
own detachments within much larger ore hordes, and 
they are always at the forefront of any attack,. relying on 
their superior strength and tactical insight to overcome 
anything that stands in their way. 
Few ore tribes actively seek out orogs to bolster their 
ranks. The orogs' superiority makes them ideal leaders, 
and thus deadly rivals to ore war chiefs, who must be 
wary of orog treachery. 
Detached KiJJers. Wanting nothing more than to' hack 
their: enemies to pieces, orogs are a terrifying presence 
on the battlefield. They form no attachments, even to 
their parents and siblings, and have no concept of love 
or dedication. They worship the ore pantheon of gods-
Gruumsh and Luthic foremost- because they believe 
that the gods have strength beyond reason, and physical 
might is all they respect. 
Servants of Darkness. Mistrusted by orcs, some 
orogs form independent mercenary war bands that 
sell themselves to the highest bidder. As long as they 
are rewarded, orog mercenaries gladly serve as elite 
warriors and shock troops for evil wizards, depraved 
giants, and other villains.
