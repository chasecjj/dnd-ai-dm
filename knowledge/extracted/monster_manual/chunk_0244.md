Ethereal jaunt. As a bonus action, the spider can magically 
shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or 
vice versa. 
Spider Climb. The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including 
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 
Web Walker. The spider ignores movement restrictions caused 
by webbing. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make 
a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 
hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even 
after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned 
in this way. 
A phase spider possesses the magical ability to phase 
in and out of the Ethereal Plane. It seems to appear 
out of nowhere and quickly vanishes after attacking. Its 
movement on the Ethereal Plane before coming back to 
the Material Plane makes it seem like it can teleport.

same statistics as a polar bear.
