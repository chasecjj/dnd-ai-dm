XORN 
Bizarre creatures native to the Elemental Plane of 
Earth, xorn sniff out gemstones and precious metals, 
then tunnel through earth and rock to consume 
those treasures. On the Material Plane, xorn must 
range far and wide through the Underdark to sustain 
themselves, becoming aggressive toward miners and 
treasure hunters when the valuable minerals of their 
diet are scarce. 
A xorn's unnatural origins are suggested by its 
unusually heavy body and the large, powerful mouth 
sitting atop its head. Its three long arms are each tipped 
with sharp talons, and its three large, stone-lidded eyes 
see in all directions. 
Elemental Travelers. Possessed of the power of 
elemental earth, a xorn glides through stone and dirt as 
easily as a fish swims through water. It doesn't displace 
earth or stone when it moves, but merges with and flows 
through it, leaving no tunnel, hole, or hint of its passage. 
XORN' 
'
Xorn prefer not to leave their home plane, where they 
easily eat their fill of gemstones and precious metals. 
When a xorn winds up on the Material Plane, whether 
by accident or from curiosity, it seeks sustenance 
and a way home. 
Beggars and Thieves. Xorn scour the depths of the 
earth for precious metal and stones. Because they 
are unable to consume organic material, they ignore 
most other creatures. However, a xorn's ability to sniff 
out metals and stones often draws its attention to 
adventurers carrying coins and gems. Because a xorn 
isn't evil, it pleads or bargains in the hope of convincing 
owners to give up their treasure, offering up information 
it has learned from its travels in exchange. A xorn 
whose requests are ignored might resort to threats and 
bullying. If starving or angered, it resorts to force.
