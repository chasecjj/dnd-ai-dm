MEZZO LOTH 
The bulk of the yugoloth population is made up of 
mezzoloths, which are human-sized insect creatures 
covered in dense chitinous plates. Mezzoloths serve 
as foot soldiers in yugoloth armies, their wide-set eyes 
glowing red as the mezzoloths bear down on their foes. 
Violence and reward are the fundamental drives of 
a mezzoloth, and powerful beings that promise one or 
the other can easily attract them into service. Although 
it has lethal claws on its four arms, a mezzoloth 
typically wields a trident in two of them. If surrounded 
by enemies, a mezzoloth exhales toxic fumes that can 
· choke and kill whole groups of creatures. 
NYCALOTH 
The elite airborne shock troops of the yugoloths, 
nycaloths look like muscular gargoyles. Powerful bat 
wings bear them swiftly aloft in battle, and the razor-
sharp claws of their hands and feet cut through flesh 
and bone with ease. A nightmarish foe, a nycaloth 
strikes hard and fast without warning, then teleports 
away. It uses its innate magic to turn invisible or 
create illusory doubles of itself, further confounding 
its enemies. 
Nycaloths are the most loyal of the yugoloths. When 
they find an evil master that treats them well, they are 
unlikely to break their agreement unless the reward for 
doing so is extreme. 
ULTROLOTH 
Ultroloths command the yugoloth armies of the Blood 
War. An ultroloth looks like a slender gray-skinned 
humanoid with an elongated head. Its face bears no 
features except for two ovoid eyes. These eyes can 
become sparkling pools of light that can transfix other 
creatures and leave them reeling and helpless. 
Frequently at one another's throats, ultroloths 
continually scheme to enhance their own 
power. When not employed to fight in the 
Blood War, ultroloths lead yugoloth 
forces throughout the planes, acting 
as crime bosses or commanders of 
evil mercenary companies. 
With a reputation for cruelty, 
ultroloths command their 
minions to fight while the 
ultroloths stay removed 
from combat themselves. 
Lesser yugoloths know 
their place when facing an 
ultroloth and respond to its 
summons without demand 
for payment.
