Assassinate. During its first turn, the assassin has advantage 
on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. 
Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature 
is a critical hit. 
Evasion. If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it 
to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the 
assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving 
throw,. and only half damage if it fails. 
Sneak Attack (1/Turn). The assassin deals an extra 13 (4d6) 
damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has 
advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 
feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the 
assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The assassin makes two shortsword attacks. 
Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one

Light Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 80/320

must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) 
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

and anyone else who can afford them.

Bandits rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, 
veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. 
Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive 
otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry. 
Pirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be 
freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or 
they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to 
attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.

Multiattack. The captain makes three melee attacks: two with 
its scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two 
ranged attacks with its daggers. 
Scimitar. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 6 (ld6 + 3) slashing damage. 
Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. 
or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. 
REACTIONS 
Parry. The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack 
that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker 
and be wielding a melee weapon. 
It takes a strong personality, ruthless 
cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang 
of bandits in line. The bandit captain has 
these qualities in spades. 
In addition to managing a crew of selfish 
malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation 
of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and 
command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must 
mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis. 
More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain 
craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's 
vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a 
prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything 
of the captain's colorful reputation.

Reckless. At the start of its turn, the berserker can gain 
advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, 
but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of 
its next turn. 
ACTIONS 
Greataxe. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 9 (1d12 + 3) slashing damage. 
Hailing from uncivilized lands, unpredictable 
berserkers come together in war parties and seek 
conflict wherever they can find it.
