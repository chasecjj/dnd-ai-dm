MUMMIES 
Raised by dark funerary rituals, a mummy shambles 
from the shrouded stillness of a time-lost temple or 
tomb. Having been awoken from its rest, it punishes 
transgressors with the power of its unholy curse. 
Preserved Wrath. The long burial rituals that 
accompany a mummy's entombment help protect 
its body from rot. In the embalming process, the 
newly dead creature's organs are removed and 
placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with 
preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body 
has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in 
linen bandages. 
The WiJJ of Dark Gods. An undead mummy is created 
when the priest of a death god or other dark deity 
ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic 
magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed 
with necromantic markings before the burial ritual 
concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a 
mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response 
to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, 
a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or 
former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise. 
The Punished. Once deceased, an individual has no 
say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. 
Some mummies were powerful individuals who 
displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed 
crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, 
they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, 
mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies 
acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put to 
death specifically to serve a greater purpose. 
Creature of Ritual. A mummy obeys the conditions 
and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, 
driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming 
terror that foreshadows a mummy's attack can leave 
the intended victim paralyzed with fright. In the days 
following a mummy's touch, a victim's body rots from 
the outside in, until nothing but dust remains. 
Ending a Mummy's Curse. Rare magic can undo or 
dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it 
to truly die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back 
to its endless rest by undoing the transgression that 
caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be replaced in its 
niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb, or 
a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed. 
More ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as 
revealing a secret the mummy wished kept or killing 
an individual the mummy loved, can't be so easily 
remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all 
the creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath. 
Undead Archives. Though they seldom bother to 
do so, mummies can speak. As a result, some serve as 
undead repositories of lost lore, and can be consulted by 
the descendants of those who created them. Powerful 
individuals sometimes intentionally sequester mummies 
away for occasional consultation. 
Undead Nature. A mummy doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
MUMMY LORD 
In the tombs of the ancients, tyrannical monarchs and 
the high priests of dark gods lie in dreamless rest, 
waiting for the time when they might reclaim their 
thrones and reforge their ancient empires. The regalia 
of their terrible rule still adorns their linen-wrapped 
bodies, their moldering robes stitched with evil symbols 
and bronze armor etched with devices of dynasties that 
fell a thousand years before. 
Under the direction of the most powerful priests, 
the ritual that creates a mummy can be increased in 
potency. The mummy lord that rises from such a ritual 
retains the memories and personality of its former 
life, and is gifted with supernatural resilience. Dead 
emperors wield the same infamous rune-marked 
blades that they did in legend. Sorcerer lords work 
the forbidden magic that once controlled a terrified 
populace, and the dark gods reward dead priest-kings' 
prayers by imparting divine spells. 
Heart of the Mummy Lord. As part of the ritual that 
creates a mummy lord, the creature's heart and viscera 
are removed from the corpse and placed in canopic jars. 
These jars are usually carved from limestone or made of 
pottery, etched or painted with religious hieroglyphs. 
As long as its shriveled heart remains intact, a 
mummy lord can't be permanently destroyed. When 
it drops to 0 hit points, the mummy lord turns to dust 
and re-forms at full strength 24 hours later, rising out 
of dust in close proximity to the canopic jar containing 
its heart. A mummy lord can be destroyed or prevented 
from re-forming by burning its heart to ashes. For this 
reason, a mummy lord usually keeps its heart and 
viscera in a hidden tomb or vault. 
The mummy lord's heart has AC 5, 25 hit points, and 
immunity to all damage except fire.
