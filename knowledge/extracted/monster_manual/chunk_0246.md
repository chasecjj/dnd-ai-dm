THE NATURE OF SWARMS 
The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign 
assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some 
sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon 
swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the 
night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause 
scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its 
tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens 
against her enemies, while a yuan-ti abomination might have 
swarms of poisonous snakes slithering in its wake. Even 
druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness 
is borderline unnatural.
