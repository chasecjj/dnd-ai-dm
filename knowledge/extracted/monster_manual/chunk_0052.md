Some devils can have an action option that allows them to 
summon other devils. 
Summon Devil (1 jDay). The devil chooses what to 
summon and attempts a magical summoning. 
• A barbed devil has a 30 percent chance of summoning one 
barbed devil. 
• A bearded devil has a 30 percent chance of summoning 
one bearded devil. 
• A bone devil has a 40 percent chance of summoning 2d6 
spined devils or one bone devil. 
• An erinyes has a 50 percent chance of summoning 3d6 
spined devils, l d6 bearded devils, or one erinyes. 
• A horned devil has a 30 percent chance of summoning one 
horned devil. 
• An ice devil has a 60 percent chance o~ summoning one 
ice devil. 
• A pit fiend summons 2d4 bearded devils, l d4 barbed 
devils, or one erinyes with no chance offailure. 
A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 
60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and 
can't summon other devils. It remains for l minute, until it 
or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it 
as an action. 
BARBED DEVIL (HAMATULA) 
Creatures of unbridled greed and desire, barbed devils 
act as guards to the more powerful denizens of the Nine 
Hells and their vaults. Resembling a tall humanoid 
covered in sharp barbs, spines, and hooks, a barbed 
devil has gleaming eyes that are ever watchful for 
objects and creatures it might claim for itself. These 
fiends welcome any chance to fight when victory 
promises reward. 
Barbed devils are known for an alertness that makes 
them difficult to surprise, and they attend to their duties 
without boredom or distraction. They use their sharp 
claws as weapons or hurl balls of flame at foes that try 
to flee them. 
BEARDED DEVIL (BARBAZU) 
Bearded devils serve archdevils as shock troops, 
fighting shoulder-to-shoulder and reveling in the glory 
of battle. They respond with violence to any slight, 
real or imagined, gorging themselves on violence 
as their infernal saw-toothed glaives carve a path 
through their foes. 
LAYERS AND LORDS OF THE NINE HELLS 
A bearded ·d~vil is humanoid in form, with ·pointed 
ears, scaly skln, a long tail, and claws that clearly show 
its fiendish nature. These devils take their names from 
the snakelike growths that adorn their chins, which they 
use to lash and poison enemies, weakening them with 
their virulent venom. 
BONE DEVIL (0SYLUTH) 
Driven by hate, lust, and envy, bone devils act as the 
cruel taskmasters of the Nine Hells. They set weaker 
devils to work, taking special delight in seeing fiends 
that defy them demoted. At the same time, they long for 
promotion and are bitterly envious of their superiors, 
attempting to curry favor though it irks them to do so. 
A bone devil appears as a humanoid husk, with dried 
skin stretched tight across its skeletal frame. It bears a 
fearsome skull-like head and the tail of a scorpion, and 
a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it. Though 
they are devastating in combat with their claws, bone 
devils also wield hooked polearms made of bone, which 
they use to subdue enemies before striking with their 
venomous tails. 
CHAIN DEVIL (KYTON) 
This ominous fiend wears chains like a shroud. Driving 
lesser creatures before it with its fearsome gaze, a chain 
devil animates the chains that cover its body as well as 
inanimate chains nearby, which sprout hooks, blades, 
and spikes to eviscerate enemies. 
Chain devils act as sadistic jailers and torturers in 
the infernal realms, relishing pain and living to inflict 
it on others. They are called on to torment mortal souls 
trapped in the Nine Hells, inflicting their sadistic fury on 
the horrid lemures in which those souls manifest. 
ERINYES 
The most beautiful and striking of all lesser and greater 
devils, the erinyes are fierce and disciplined warriors. 
Sweeping down from the skies, they bring swift death 
to creatures that have wronged their masters or defied 
the edicts of Asmodeus. The erinyes appear as male 
or female humanoids with statuesque builds and large 
feathery wings. Most wear stylized armor and horned 
helms, and carry exquisite swords and bows. A few also 
use ropes of entanglement to ensnare powerful foes.
