Amphibious. The dragon turtle can breathe air and water. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with 
its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in 
place of its two claw attacks. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. 
Hit: 26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. 
Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage. 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. 
Hit: 26 (3d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a 
creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw 
or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and 
knocked prone. 
Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dragon turtle exhales 
scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area 
must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (1Sd6) 
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance 
against this damage. 
DRAGON TURTLE 
Dragon turtles are among the most fearsome creatures 
of the oceans. As large and voracious as the oldest of its 
land-based dragon kin, a dragon turtle strikes with its 
deadly jaws, steaming breath, and crushing tail. 
A dragon turtle's rough shell is the same dark green 
color as the deep water where this monster dwells. 
Silver highlights lining the shell resemble light 
dancing on open water, and a surfacing dragon turtle 
is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or 
moon on the waves. 
Dragons of the Deep. Like true dragons, dragon 
turtles collect treasure, first by sinking ships and then 
by sifting through the wreckage for coins and other 
precious items. A dragon turtle swallows treasure for 
transport, then regurgitates it when it reaches its lair. 
Dragon turtles dwell in caves hidden in coral reefs 
or beneath the seafloor, or along rugged stretches 
of coastline. If a choice cave is already inhabited, a 
dragon turtle attacks its current residents in an attempt 
to take over. 
Mercenary Monsters. A dragon turtle is smart 
enough to be bribed, and pirates sailing seas patrolled 
by these creatures quickly learn to offer them treasure 
in exchange for safe passage. Clever sahuagin 
sometimes ally with dragon turtles, enticing them 
with treasure to use their blistering breath weapons in 
sahuagin raids against ships and coastal settlements. 
Elemental Might. Dragon turtles sometimes find their 
way through sunken planar rifts to the Elemental Plane 
of Water. Those monstrous specimens can often be 
found in the service of marids, which strap magnificent' .. 
coral thrones to the backs of dragon turtles and ride ' · 
them as mounts.
