piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen 
humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine 
jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures 
that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the 
remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels 
of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and 
monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities. 
A SILVER DRAGON's LAIR 
Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making 
their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though 
many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or 
ab'andoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts 
of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop 
citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is 
the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (iosing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: 
The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog 
cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on 
the next round.

REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing a legendary silver dragon's lair 
is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or 
more of the following effects. 
• Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 
6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't 
need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to 
the control weather spell. 
• Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures 
that fall due to no act of the dragon's or its allies. Such 
creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and 
take no falling damage. 
• Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make 
clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming 
structures and other objects as it wishes. 
If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, 
as described in the spell, and the other effects fade 
in 1d10 days.
