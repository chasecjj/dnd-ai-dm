GOLD DRAGON 
The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, 
gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil. 
A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with 
' flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep 
back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that 
adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start 
at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting 
it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming 
through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales 
of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow 
larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its 
pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold. 
DevourerofWealth. Gold dragons can eat just about 
anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and 
gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge 
itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure 
that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, 
as long as they aren't bribes. 
Reserved Shapeshifters. Gold dragons are respected 
by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and

fairn€ss, b;ut t,hey are the most aloof and grim of the 
good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the 
exten t~that tl\ey rarely fraternize with other dragons 
except their own mates and offspring. 
Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid 
forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its 
true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly 
visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest 
businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In 
the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost 
child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as 
a companion for days or weeks on end. 
Master Hoarders. A gold dragon keeps its hoard in-
a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards 
placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove 
any treasures without the dragon knowing about it. 
A G OLD DRAGON'S LAIR 
Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way 
places, where they can do as they please without 
arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes

the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for 
the next 24 hours. 
Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6). The d ragan uses one of the 
following breath weapons. 
Fire Breath. The dragon exhales fi re in a 60-foot cone. Each 
creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 66 (12d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. 
Weakening Breath. The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. 
Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength 
saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack 
rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
Change Shape. The dragon magically polymorphs into a 
humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than 
its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if 
it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or 
borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). 
In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, 
Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, 
lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as 
well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise 
replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or 
legendary actions of that form. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the 
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used 
at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The 
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. 
Detect. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack. 
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. 
Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed 
on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) 
bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can 
then fly up to half its flying speed.
