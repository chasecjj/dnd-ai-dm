face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient 
charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a 
barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming 
a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, 
moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an 
action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs 
out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by 
pressing a different face of the cube and expending the 
requisite number of charges, resetting the duration. 
If your movement causes the barrier to come into 
contact with a solid object that can't pass through the 
cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as 
the barrier remains.

CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
CUBIC GATE 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable 
magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each 
keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is 
the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to plane: 
determined by the DM. 
You can use an action to press one side of the cube to 
cast the gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane 
keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to 
press one side twice, you can cast the plane shift spell 
(save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to 
the plane keyed to that side. 
The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expend: 
1 charge. The cube regains ld3 expended charges 
daily at dawn. 
DAERN'S INSTANT FORTRESS 
Wondrous item, rare 
You can use an action to place this l-inch metal cube 
on the ground and speak its command word. The cube 
rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use 
an action to speak the command word that dismisses ir. 
which works only if the fortress is empty. 
The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side 
and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a 
battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors. 
with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. 
The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When 
activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing 
you. The door opens only at your command, which 
you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the 
knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime 
of opening. 
Each creature in the area where the fortress appears 
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
lOdlO bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. In either case, 
the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside 
but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't 
being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed 
automatically . .
