CREATING A CAMPAIGN 
The world you create is the stage for the 
adventures you set in it. You don't have to give more 
thought to it than that. You can run adventures in 
an episodic format, with the characters as the only 
common element, and also weave themes throughout 
those adventures to build a greater saga of the 
characters' achievements in the world. 
P lanning an entire campaign might seem like a 
daunting task, but you don't have to plot out every 
detail right from the start. You can start with the 
basics, running a few adventures, and think about 
larger plotlines you want to explore as the campaign 
progresses. You're free to add as much or as little detail 
a you wish. 
The start of a campaign resembles the start of an 
adventure. You want to jump quickly into the action, 
how the players that adventure awaits, and grab 
their attention right away. Give the players enough 
information to make them want to come back week after 
·eek to see how the story plays out. 
START SMALL 
\"hen you first start building your campaign, start 
-mall. The characters need to know only about the 
city, town, or village where they start the game, and 
perhaps the nearby dungeon. You might decide that 
the barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a 
distant forest is crawling with ettercaps and giant 
piders, and you should note these things. But at 
the start of the game, the local area is enough to get 
the campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to 
create that local area: 
1. CREATE A HOME BASE 
ee the "Settlements" section earlier in this chapter 
;"or guidance on building this settlement. A small 
·own or village at the edge of the wilderness serves 
a fine home base in most D&D campaigns. Use 
a larger town or city if you want a campaign with 
rban adventuring. 
2. CREATE A LOCAL REGION 
- ee "Mapping the Campaign" earlier in this chapter 
:or guidance. Draw a map at province scale (1 hex= 
l mile) with the home base near the center. Fill 
n the area within a day's travel-about 25 to 30 
:niles-of the home base. Pepper it with two to 
:our dungeons or similar adventure locales . 
. -ill area that size is likely to have one to three 
additional settlements as well as the home base, 
so give thought to them as well. 
3. CRAFT A STARTING ADVENTURE 
ingle dungeon makes a good first adventure 
'or most campaigns. See chapter 3, "Creating 
_ dventures," for guidance. 
A home base provides a common starting 
.ocation for the characters. This starting point 
might be the village where they grew up or a 
ci _- that attracted them from points beyond.

Or perhaps they begin the campaign in the dungeons 
of an evil baron's castle where they've been locked up 
for various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing 
them into the midst of the adventure. 
For each of these steps, give the locations only as 
much detail as they need. You don't need to identify 
every building in a village or label every street in a large 
city. If the characters start in the baron's dungeon, you'll 
need the details of this first adventure site, but you 
don't have to name all the baron's knights. Sketch out 
a simple map, think about the surrounding area, and 
consider whom the characters are most likely to interact 
with early in the campaign. Most important, visualize 
how this area fits into the theme and story you have in 
mind for your campaign. Then start working on your 
first adventure! 
SET THE STAGE 
As you start to develop your campaign, you'll need to 
fill in the players on the basics. For easy distribution, 
compile essential information into a campaign 
handout. Such a handout typically includes the 
following material: 
Any restrictions or new options for character creation, 
such as new or prohibited races. 
Any information in the backs tory of your campaign 
that the characters would know about. If you have 
a theme or direction in mind for the campaign, this 
information could include seeds hinting at that focus. 
• Basic information about the area where the characters 
are starting, such as the name of the town, important 
locations in and around it, prominent NPCs they'd 
know about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble 
that's brewing. 
Keep this handout short and to the point. Two pages 
is a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of 
creative energy that produces twenty pages of great 
background material, save it for your adventures. Let 
the players uncover the details gradually in play. 
INVOLVING THE CHARACTERS 
Once you've identified what your campaign is about, 
let the players help tell the story by deciding how their 
characters are involved. This is their opportunity to 
tie their characters' history and background to the 
campaign, and a chance for you to determine how the 
various elements of each character's background tie 
into the campaign's story. For example, what secret has 
the hermit character learned? What is the status of the 
noble character's family? What is the folk hero's destiny? 
Some players might have trouble coming up with 
ideas-not everyone is equally inventive. You can help 
spur their creativity with a few questions about their 
characters: 
Are you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, 
who's your family? What's your current occupation? 
• Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? 
Why did you come to this area? 
CHAPTER I I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
Are you tied to any of the organizations or people 
involved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are 
they friends or enemies? 
Listen to the players' ideas, and say yes if you can. 
Even if you want all the characters to have grown up in 
the starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or 
a transplant if the player's story is convincing enough. 
Suggest alterations to a character's story so it better fits 
your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign 
into that story. 
CREATING A BACKGROUND 
Backgrounds are designed to root player characters 
in the world, and creating new backgrounds is a great 
way to introduce players to the special features of your 
world. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures, 
organizations, and historical events from your campaign 
are particularly strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain 
religion live as beggars supported by a pious populace, 
singing the tales of their deity's exploits to entertain 
and enlighten the faithful. You could create a mendicant 
priest background (or modify the acolyte background) 
to reflect these qualities. It could include musical 
instrument proficiency, and its feature probably involves 
receiving hospitality from the faithful. 
Guidelines for creating a new background are 
provided in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop." 
CAMPAIGN EVENTS 
Significant events in the history of a fantasy world tend 
toward immense upheavals: wars that pit the forces 
of good against evil in an epic confrontation, natural 
disasters that lay waste to entire civilizations, invasions 
of vast armies or extra planar hordes, assassinations 
of world leaders. These world-shaking events title the 
chapters of history. 
In a D&D game, such events provide the sparks that 
can ignite and sustain a campaign. The most common 
pitfall of serial stories without a set beginning, mfddle, 
and end is inertia. Like many television shows and 
comic-book series, a D&D campaign runs the risk of 
retreading the same ground long after the enjoyment's 
gone. Just as actors or writers drift away from those 
other mediums, so can players- the actors and writers 
of a D&D game. Games stagnate when the story 
meanders too long without a change in tone, when the 
same villains and similar adventures grow tiresome and 
predictable, and when the world doesn't change around 
the characters and in response to their actions. 
World-shaking events force conflict. They set new 
events and power groups in motion. Their outcomes 
change the world by altering the tone of the setting 
in a meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your 
world in big, bold print. Change- especially change that 
occurs as a result of the characters' actions-keeps the 
story moving. If change is imperceptible, the actions 
of the characters lack significance. When the world 
becomes reliable, it's time to shake things up.
