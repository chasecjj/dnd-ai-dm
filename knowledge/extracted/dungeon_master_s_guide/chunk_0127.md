FoLDING BoAT 
GEM OF 
BRIGHTNESS 
The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 
hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its 
horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes 
a +1/ance, and the other becomes a +2 /ongsword. 
Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons 
disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts 
to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 
30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. 
Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the 
aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw 
or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the 
goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once 
it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is 
immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once 
the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 
15 days have passed. 
Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is 
about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant 
for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be 
used again until 7 days have passed. 
Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian 
horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The 
nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been 
used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed. 
If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 
percent chance each time you use it to ignore your 
orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. 
If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your 
orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported 
to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the 
nightmare reverts to figurine form. 
Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can 
become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
FROST BRAND 
an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also 
has dark vision out to a range of 60 feet and can see 
invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once 
it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days 
have passed. 
Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette of 
an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once 
it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have 
passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with 
you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of 
existence. 
Silver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette of 
a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it 
has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have 
passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to 
cast the animal messenger spell on it at will. 
FLAME TONGUE 
Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement) 
You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword' 
command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. 
These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and 
dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is 
ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target 
it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to 
speak the command word again or until you drop or 
sheathe the sword. 
FOLDING BOAT 
Wondrous item, rare 
This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 
inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weigh 
4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items 
inside. This item also has three command words, each 
requiring you to use an action to speak it.
