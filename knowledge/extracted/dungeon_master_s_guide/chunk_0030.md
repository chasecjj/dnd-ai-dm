- e protagonists are motivated more by greed and self-
rerest than by altruistic virtue. Fighter, rogue, and 
:Jarbarian characters tend to be far more common than 
izards, clerics, or paladins. In such a pulp fantasy 
: rting, those who wield magic often symbolize the 
:.ecadence and corruption of civilization, and wizards 
-e the classic villains of these settings. Magic items are 
· erefore rare and often dangerous. 
Certain DUNGEONS & DRAGONS novels follow in the 
-
tsteps of classic sword-and-sorcery novels. The world 
; Athas (as featured in numerous Dark Sun novels and 
,arne products), with its heroic gladiators and tyrannical 
: rcerer-kings, belongs squarely in this genre. 
IPIC FANTASY 
-.devout paladin in gleaming plate armor braces her 
- ce as she charges a dragon. Bidding farewell to his 
ear love, a noble wizard sets forth on a quest to close 
e gate to the Nine Hells that has opened in the remote 
· derness. A close-knit band of loyal friends strives to 
·ercome the forces of a tyrannical overlord. 
An epic-fantasy campaign emphasizes the conflict 
tween good and evil as a prominent element 
• r.he game, with the adventurers more or less 
:: uarely on the side of good. These characters 
-e heroes in the best sense, driven by a higher 
ose than selfish gain or ambition, and facing 
~credible dangers without blinking. Characters 
~·ght struggle with moral quandaries, fighting 
e evil tendencies within themselves as well as 
-e evil that threatens the world. And the stories of 
-e e campaigns often include an element of romance: 
;agic affairs between star-crossed lovers, passion that 
:anscends even death, and chaste adoration between 
-
·out knights and the monarchs and nobles they serve. 
The novels of the Dragon lance saga exemplify the 
::adition of epic fantasy in D&D. 
_ fYTHIC FANTASY

~grou p of demigods undertake twelve labors to win the

A mythic-fantasy campaign draws on the themes and 
:-ories of ancient myth and legend, from Gilgamesh 
Cu Chulainn. Adventurers attempt mighty feats of 
egend, aided or hindered by the gods or their agents-
. :1d they might have divine blood themselves. The 
-
nsters and villains they face probably have a similarl!ll 
:igin. The minotaur in the dungeon isn't just another 
!-headed humanoid, but the Minotaur- misbegotten 
.:r pring of a philandering god. Adventures might lead 
e heroes through a series of trials to the realms of the 
in search of a gift or favor. 
uch a campaign can draw on the myths and legends 
c any culture, not just the familiar Greek tales.

DARK FANTASY 
Vampires brood on the battlements of their accursed 
castles. Necromancers toil in dark dungeons to create 
horrid servants made of dead flesh. Devils corrupt the 
innocent, and werewolves prowl the night. All of these 
elements evoke horrific aspects of the fantasy genre. 
If you want to put a horror spin on your campaign, 
you have plenty of material to work with. The Monster 
Manual is full of creatures that perfectly suit a storyline 
of supernatural horror. The most important element of 
such a campaign, though, isn't covered by the rules. A 
dark-fantasy setting requires an atmosphere of building 
dread, created through careful pacing and evocative 
description. Your players contribute too; they have to 
be willing to embrace the mood you're trying to evoke. 
Whether you want to run a full-fledged dark-fantasy 
campaign or a single creepy adventure, you should 
discuss your plans with the players ahead of time to 
make sure they're on board. Horror can be intense 
and personal, and not everyone is comfortable with 
such a game. 
Novels and game products set in Ravenloft, the 
Demiplane of Dread, explore dark-fantasy elements in a 
D&D context. 
INTRIGUE 
The corrupt vizier schemes with the baron's oldest 
daughter to assassinate the baron. A hobgoblin army 
sends doppelganger spies to infiltrate the city before the 
invasion. At the embassy ball, the spy in the royal court 
makes contact with his employer. 
Political intrigue, espionage, sabotage, and similar 
cloak-and-dagger activities can provide the basis for 
an exciting D&D campaign. In this kind of game, the 
characters might care more about skill training and 
making contacts than about attack spells and magic 
weapons. Roleplaying and social interaction take on 
greater importance than combat, and the party might go 
for several sessions without seeing a monster. 
Again, make sure your players know ahead of time 
that you want to run this kind of campaign. Otherwise, 
a player might create a defense-focused dwarf paladin, 
only to find he is out of place among half-elf diplomats 
and tiefling spies. 
The Brimstone Angels novels by Erin M. Evans focus 
on intrigue in the Forgotten Realms setting, from the 
backstabbing politics of the Nine Hells to the contested 
s_uccession of Cormyrean royalty. 
MYSTERY 
Who stole three legendary magic weapons and hid them 
away in a remote dungeon, leaving a cryptic clue to their 
location? Who placed the duke into a magical slumber, 
and what can be done to awaken him? Who murdered 
the guildmaster, and how did the killer get into the 
guild's locked vault? 
A mystery-themed campaign puts the characters in 
the role of investigators, perhaps traveling from town 
to town to crack tough cases the local authorities can't 
handle. Such a campaign emphasizes puzzles and 
problem-solving in addition to combat prowess. 
A larger mystery might even set the stage for the 
whole campaign. Why did someone kill the characters' 
mentor, setting them on the path of adventure? Who 
really controls the Cult of the Red Hand? In this case, 
the characters might uncover clues to the greater 
mystery only once in a while; individual adventures 
might be at best tangentially related to that theme. A 
diet of nothing but puzzles can become frustrating, so 
be sure to mix up the kinds of encounters you present. 
Novels in various D&D settings have explored the 
mystery genre with a fantasy twist. In particular, Murder 
in Cormyr (by Chet Williamson), Murder in Halruaa (by 
Richard S. Meyers), and Spellstorm (by Ed Greenwood) 
are mysteries set in the Forgotten Realms. Murder 
in Tarsis (by John Maddox Roberts) takes the same 
approach in the Dragonlance setting. 
SWASHBUCKLING 
Rapier-wielding sailors fight off boarding sahuagin. 
Ghouls lurk in derelict ships, waiting to devour treasure 
hunters. Dashing rogues and charming paladins weave 
their way through palace intrigues and leap from 
balconies onto waiting horses below. 
The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and 
musketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic 
campaign. The characters typically spend more 
time in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels 
than in dungeon delves, making interaction skills 
important (though not to the extent of a pure intrigue 
campaign). Nevertheless, the heroes might end up in 
classic dungeon situations, such as searching storm 
sewers beneath the palace to find the evil duke's 
hidden chambers. 
A good example of a swashbuckling rogue in the 
Forgotten Realms is Jack Ravenwild, who appears in 
novels by Richard Baker (City of Ravens and Prince 
of Ravens). 
WAR 
A hobgoblin army marches toward the city, leading 
elephants and giants to batter down the stronghold's 
walls and ramparts. Dragons wheel above a barbarian 
horde, scattering enemies as the raging warriors 
cut a swath through field and forest. Salamanders 
muster at an efreeti's command, poised to assault an 
astral fortress.
