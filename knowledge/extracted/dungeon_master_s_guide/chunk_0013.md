each is ruled by a council of drow high priestesses who 
answer to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders. 
Meritocracy. The most intelligent and educated 
people oversee the society, often with a bureaucracy 
to handle the day-to-day work of government. In the 
Forgotten Realms, scholarly monks preside over the 
fortress-library of Candlekeep, overseen by a master of 
lore called the Keeper. 
Militocracy. Military leaders run the nation under 
martial law, using the army and other armed forces. A 
militocracy might be based on an elite group of soldiers, 
an order of dragon riders, or a league of sea princes. 
olamnia, a nation ruled by knights in the Dragonlance 
campaign setting, falls into this category. 
Monarchy. A single hereditary sovereign wears the 
crown. Unlike the autocrat, the monarch's powers are 
limited by law, and the ruler serves as the head of a 
democracy, feudal state, or militocracy. The kingdom 
of Breland, in the Eberron campaign setting, has both 
a parliament that makes laws and a monarch who 
enforces them. 
Oligarchy. A small number of absolute rulers share 
power, possibly dividing the land into districts or 
provinces under their control, or jointly ruling together. 
_.\group of adventurers who take control of a nation 
together might form an oligarchy. The Free City of 
Greyhawk is an oligarchy composed of various faction 
leaders, with a Lord Mayor as its figurehead. 
Plutocracy. Society is governed by the wealthy. The 
elite form a ruling council, purchase representati"on at 
rhe court of a figurehead monarch, or rule by default 
because money is the true power in the realm. Many 
cities in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, 
including Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, are plutocracies. 
Republic. Government is entrusted to representatives 
of an established electorate who rule on behalf of the 
electors. Any democracy in which only landowners or 
certain classes can vote could be considered a republic. 
Satrapy. Conquerors and representatives of another 
government wield power, ruling the settlement or region 
as part of a larger empire. The satraps are bureaucrats 
and military officers, or unusual characters or monsters. 
The cities of High port and Suder ham in the Greyhawk 
campaign setting are satrapies controlled by agents of a 
,·icious gang of marauders known as the Slave Lords. 
Theocracy. Rulership falls to a direct representative 
or a collection of agents of a deity. The centers of power 
in a theocracy are usually located on sacred sites. In 
the Eberron campaign setting, the nation of Thrane is 
a theocracy devoted to the Silver Flame, a divine spirit 
that resides in Thrane's capital of Flamekeep.

COMMERCE 
Even small villages can provide characters access to the 
gear they need to pursue their adventures. Provisions, 
tents, backpacks, and simple weapons are commonly 
available. Traveling merchants carry armor, martial 
weapons, and more specialized gear. Most villages have 
inns that cater to travelers, where adventurers can find 
a hot meal and a bed, even if the quality leaves much to 
be desired. 
Villages rely heavily on trade with other settlements, 
including larger towns and cities. Merchants pass 
through regularly, selling necessities and luxuries to the 
vil,Iagers, and any successful merchant has far-reaching 
contacts across the region. Traveling merchants pass 
on gossip and adventure hooks to the characters as 
they conduct their business. Since merchants make 
their living traversing roads that might be menaced 
by bandits or wandering monsters, they hire guards to 
keep their goods safe. They also carry news from town 
to town, including reports of situations that cry out for 
the attention of adventurers. 
These merchants can't provide the services normally 
found in a city. For instance, when the characters are in 
need of a library or a dedicated sage, a trainer who can 
handle the griffon eggs they've found, or an architect to 
design their castle, they're better off going to a large city 
than looking in a village. 
CURRENCY 
The straightforward terms "gold piece" (gp), "silver 
piece" (sp), "copper piece" (cp), "electrum piece" (ep), 
and "platinum piece" (pp) are used throughout the game 
rules for clarity. You can imbue these denominations 
with more interesting descriptions in your game 
world. People give coins specific names, whether 
as plain as "dime" or lively as "gold double-eagle." A 
country typically mints its own currency, which might 
correspond to the basic rules terms. In most worlds, few 
currencies achieve widespread distribution, but nearly 
all coins are accepted worldwide-except by those 
looking to pick a fight with a foreigner. 
ExAMPLE: THE FoRGOTTEN REALMS 
The world of the Forgotten Realms provides an 
extensive example of currencies. Although barter, 
blood notes, and similar letters of trade are common 
enough in Faerfin, metal coins and trade bars are the 
everyday currency. 
Common Coinage. Coins appear in a bewildering 
variety of shapes, sizes, names, and materials. Thanks 
to the ambitious traders of Sembia, that nation's oddly 
shaped coins can be found throughout Faerfin. In 
S embia, square iron steelpence replace copper coins. 
Triangular silver pieces are ravens, diamond-shaped 
electrum pieces are harmarks (commonly called "blue 
eyes"), and five-sided gold pieces are nobles. Sembia 
doesn't mint platinum coins. All coinage is accepted 
in Sembia, including copper and platinum pieces 
from abroad. 
In Waterdeep, the bustling cosmopolitan center 
of trade, coppers are called nibs, silvers are shards,
