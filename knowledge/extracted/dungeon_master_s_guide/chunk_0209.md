Instead of using the effect described in the table, you 
can put the responsibility of representing a character's 
lingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the 
Lingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering 
the effect described for that result, that character gains 
a new flaw with the same name. It's up to the player to 
express the lingering injury during play, just like any 
other flaw, with the potential to gain inspiration when 
the injury affects the character in a meaningful way. 
MASSIVE DAMAGE 
This optional rule makes it easier for a creature to be 
felled by massive damage. 
When a creature takes damage from a single source 
equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it 
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw 
or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the 
System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a 
hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution 
save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source. 
SYSTEM SHOCK 
dlO 
Effect 
The creature drops to 0 hit points. 
2-3 
The creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable. 
4-5 
The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. 
6-7 
The creature can't take reactions and has 
disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until 
the end of its next turn. 
8-10 
The creature can't take reactions unti l the end of its 
next turn. 
MORALE 
Some combatants might run away when a fight turns 
against them. You can use this optional rule to help 
determine when monsters and NPCs flee. 
A creature might flee under any of the following 
circumstances: 
• The creature is surprised. 
The creature is reduced to half its hit points or fewer 
for the first time in the battle. 
The creature has no way to harm the opposing side 
on its turn. 
A group of creatures might flee under any of the 
following circumstances: 
All the creatures in the group are surprised. 
The group's leader is reduced to 0 hit points, 
incapacitated, taken prisoner, or removed from battle. 
• The group is reduced to half its original size with no 
losses on the opposing side. 
To determine whether a creature or group of 
creatures flees, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw 
for the creature or the group's leader. If the opposition 
is overwhelming, the saving throw is made with 
disadvantage, or you can decide that the save fails 
automatically. If a group's leader can't make the saving 
throw for whatever reason, have the creature in the 
group with the next highest Charisma score make the 
saving throw instead. 
On a failed save, the affectedereature or group flees 
by the most expeditious route. If escape is impossible, 
the creature or group surrenders. If a creature or group 
that surrenders is attacked by its conquerors, the battle 
might resume, and it's unlikely that further attempts to 
flee or surrender will be made. 
A failed saving throw isn't always to the adventurers' 
benefit. For example, an ogre that flees from combat 
might put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with 
treasure that the characters had hoped to plunder. 
CREATING A MONSTER 
The Monster Manual contains hundreds of ready-to-play 
monSters, but it doesn't include every monster that you 
can imagine. Part of the D&D experience is the simple 
joy of creating new monsters and customizing existing 
ones, if for no other reason than to surprise and delight 
your players with something they've never faced before. 
The first step in the process is coming up with the 
concept for your monster. What makes it unique? Where 
does it live? What role do you want it to serve in your 
adventure, your campaign, or your world? What does 
it look like? Does it have any weird abilities? Once you 
have the answers to these questions, you can start 
figuring out how to represent your monster in the game. 
MODIFYING A MONSTER 
Once you have an idea for a monster, you'll need 
statistics to represent it. The first question you should 
ask yourself is: Can I use statistics that already exist? 
A stat block in the Monster Manual might make a 
good starting point for your monster. Imagine, for 
example, that you want to create an intelligent arboreal 
predator that hunts elves. There is no such monster 
in the Monster Manual, but the quaggoth is a savage 
humanoid predator with a climbing speed. You could 
borrow the quaggoth stat block for your new monster, 
changing nothing but the creature's name. You can also 
make minor tweaks, such as replacing the quaggoth's 
language, Undercommon, with one that's more 
appropriate, such as Elvish or Sylvan. 
Need a fiery phoenix? Take the giant eagle or roc, give 
it immunity to fire, and allow it to deal fire damage with 
its attacks. Need a flying monkey? Consider a baboon 
with wings and a flying speed. Almost any monster you 
can imagine can be built using one that already exists. 
Adapting a stat block is far less time-consuming than 
creating one from scratch, and there are changes you 
can make to an existing monster that have no effect 
on its challenge rating, such as swapping languages, 
changing its alignment, or adding special senses. 
However, once you change the creature's offensive or 
defensive ability, such as its hit points or damage, its 
challenge rating might need to change, as shown later. 
SWITCHING WEAPONS 
If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, you can 
replace that weapon with a different one. For example, 
you could replace a hobgoblin's longsword with a 
halberd. Don't forget to change the damage and the 
attack's reach where appropriate. Also be aware of the
