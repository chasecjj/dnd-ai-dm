11oLv AvENGER 
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature 
rakes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. 
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much 
damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made 
of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving 
throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6. 
Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance 
of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 
10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn. 
H ORN OF VALHALLA 
Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), 
or legendary (iron) 
You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, 
warrior spirits from the plane ofYsgard appear within 
60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics 
'rom the Monster Manual. They return to Ysgard after 1 
hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the 
horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed. 
Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each 
made of a different metal. The horn's type determines 
how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as 
£he requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's 
rype or determines it randomly.

HORSESHOES OF A ZEPHYR 
Wondrous item, very rare 
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all 
four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar 
creature, they allow the creature to move normally 
while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect 
means the cre.ature can cross or stand above nonsolid 
or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The 
creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In 
addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up 
to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a 
forced march. 
HORSESHOES OF SPEED 
Wondrous item, rare 
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all 
four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar 
creature, they increase the creature's walking speed 
by 30 feet. 
IMMOVABLE Ron 
Rod, uncommon 
This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use 
an action to press the button, which causes the rod to 
become magically fixed in place. Until you or another 
creature uses an action to push the button again, the 
rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod 
can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight 
causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use 
an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the 
fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.
