that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space 
can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from 
a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside 
the extraplanar space.

securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or 
unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
