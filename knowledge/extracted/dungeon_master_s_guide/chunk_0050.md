that figure into the schemes of the Spider Queen. 
Lolth's servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, 
trapping and hunting Lolth's hated enemies within 
crisscrossing corridors of web-mortared stone. 
Far beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless 
Demonweb Pits where the Spider Queen dwells. There, 
Lolth is surrounded by her handmaidens- yochlol 
demons created to serve her and which outrank 
mightier demons while in the Spider Queen's realm. 
The Endless Maze. Baphomet's layer of the Abyss is 
a never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the 
Horned King's enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing 
jumble of crooked hallways and myriad chambers, the 
palace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat concealing 
a maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels 
eading deeper into the fortress. 
The Triple Realm. The Dark Prince Graz'zt rules 
over the realm of Azzagrat, which encompasses three 
ayers of the Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic 
Argent Palace in the city of Zelatar, whose bustling 
markets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from across 
me multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and 
perverse delights. By Graz'zt's command, the demons 
of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly 
comity. However, the so-called Triple Realm holds as 
uch danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar 
i itors can vanish without a trace in its mazelike cities 
and in forests whose trees have serpents for branches. 
Death DeJJs. Yeenoghu rules a layer of ravines known 
Death Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive. 
.=:ven the plants, which must bathe their roots in blood, 
- are the unwary. Yeenoghu's servants, helping to sate 
eir master's hunger as he prowls his kingdom seeking 
_ ey, capture creatures from the Material Plane for 
lease in the Gnoll Lord's realm. 
CARCERI 
-:-he model for all other prisons in existence, Carceri 
- a plane of desolation and despair. Its six layers hold 
r bogs, fetid jungles, windswept deserts, jagged 
ountains, frigid oceans, and black ice. All form a 
· erable home for the traitors and backstabbers that 
--e trapped on this prison plane. 
O PTIONAL RULE: PRISON PLA NE 
_ -o one can leave Carceri easily. Magical efforts to leave 
· e plane by any spell other than a wish simply fail. 
:>onals and gates that open onto the plane become one-
y only. Secret ways out of the plane exist, but they are 
- -dden and well guarded by traps and deadly monsters. 
:-lADES 
-----------------------------------
-
e layers of Hades are called the Three Glooms-
aces without joy, hope, or passion. A gray land with 
:~ ashen sky, Hades is the destination of many souls 
- ar are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper Planes or 
· e fiendish rulers of the Lower Planes. These souls 
- come larvae and spend eternity in this place that 
cks a sun, a moon, stars, or seasons. Leaching away 
lor and emotion, this gloom is more than most visitors 
can stand. The "Shadowfell Despair" rule earlier in the 
apter can be used to represent a visitor's despair. 
OPTIONAL RULE : V I LE TRA NSFORMATION 
At the end of each long rest taken on the plane, a visitor 
must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed 
save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion, which 
can't be removed while the creature remains in Hades. 
If the creature reaches six levels of exhaustion, it doesn't 
die. Instead, the creature permanently transforms into 
a larva, whereupon all levels of exhaustion afflicting the 
creature are removed. 
A larva is a miserable fiend that retains the facial 
features of its previous form but has the body of a fat 
worm. A larva has only a few faint memories of its 
previous life and the statistics in the larva stat block. 
Hades is crawling with larvae. Night hags, liches, and 
rakshasas harvest them for use in vile rituals. Other 
fiends like to feed on them.

GEHENNA 
Gehenna is the plane of suspicion and greed. It is the 
birthplace of the yugoloths, which dwell here in great 
numbers. A volcanic mountain dominates each of the 
four layers of Gehenna, and lesser volcanic earth bergs 
drift in the air and smash into the greater mountains. 
The rocky slopes of the plane make movement here 
difficult and dangerous. The ground inclines at least 
45 degrees almost everywhere. In places, steep cliffs 
and deep canyons present more challenging obstacles. 
Hazards include volcanic fissures that vent noxious 
fumes or searing flames. 
Gehenna has no room for mercy or compassion. The 
fiends living here are among the greediest and most 
selfish in all the multiverse. 
OPTIONAL RULE: CRUEL HINDRANCE 
The plane's cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to 
help one another. Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a 
beneficial effect, including a spell that restores hit points 
or removes a condition, the caster must first make a DC 
10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell 
fails, the spell slot is expended, and the action is wasted.
