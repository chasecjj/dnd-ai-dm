Weapon (any sword), rare

with this magic weapon. 
When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon 
takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's type. For 
the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any 
creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles 
and wyverns. 
DRIFTGLOBE 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you 
are within 60 feet of it, you can speak its command word 
and cause it to emanate the light or daylight spell. Once 
used, the daylight effect can't be used again until the 
next dawn. 
You can speak another command word as an action to 
make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no 
more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this 
way until you or another creature grasps it. If you mpve 
more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows 
you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest 
route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks 
gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light 
winks out. 
DUST OF DISAPPEARANCE

Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very 
fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you 
use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and

each creature and object within 10 feet of you become 
invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for 
all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic 
takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or 
casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature. 
DUST OF DRYNESS 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You 
can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. 
The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one 
marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the 
dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. 
Someone can use an action to smash the pellet 
against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and 
release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that 
pellet's magic. 
An elemental composed mostly of water that is 
exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. 
DUST OF SNEEZING AND CHOKING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
Found in a small container, this powder resembles very 
fine sand. It appears to be dust of disappearance, and an 
identify spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it 
for one use.

dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to 
breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe,
