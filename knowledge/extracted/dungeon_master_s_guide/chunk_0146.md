slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored 
levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell 
as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in 
the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot. 
A newly found rod has ldlO levels of spell energy 
stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb 
spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes 
nonmagical. 
Ron OF ALERTNESS 
Rod, very rare (requires attunement) 
This rod has a flanged head and the following 
properties. 
Alertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage 
on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for 
initiative. 
SpeJJs. While holding the rod, you can use an action 
to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and 
good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see 
invisibility. 
Protective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft 
end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head 
sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for 
an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and 
any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to 
AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any 
invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light. 
The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 
10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull 
the rod from the ground. This property can't be used 
again until the next dawn. 
Ron oF LoRDLY MIGHT 
Rod, legendary (requires attunement) 
This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic 
mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage roll 
made with it. The rod has properties associated with si.:_ 
different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It 
has three other properties as well, detailed below. 
Six Buttons. You can press one of the rod's six 
buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until 
you push a different button or until you push the same 
button again, which causes the rod to revert to its 
normal form. 
If you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue 
as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's 
flanged head. 
If you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds 
down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, 
transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants 
a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. 
If you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds 
down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the 
rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming 
the rod into a magic spear that grants a + 3 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with it. 
If you press button 4, the rod transforms into a 
climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In 
surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and 
three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal 
bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, 
forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pound .
