~orta l " is a general term for a stationary interplanar 
nnection that links a specific location on one plane 
a pecific location on another. Some portals function 
.:-e doorways, appearing as a clear window or a fog-
.;.--ouded passage, and interplanar travel is as simple 
.--epping through the doorway. Other portals are 
tions-circles of standing stones, soaring towers, 
ing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in 
tiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to 
- ther. Some are vortices, joining an Elemental Plane 
- a very similar location on the Material Plane, such 
-= - e heart of a volcano (leading to the· Plane of Fire) or 
depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).

ing through a planar portal can be the simplest 
_-w travel from the Material Plane to a desired 
arion on another plane. Most of the time, though, a 
:tal presents an adventure in itself. 
:=-
t. the adventurers must find a portal that leads 
ere they want to go. Most portals exist in distant 
ations, and a portal's location often has thematic 
- arities to the plane it leads to. For example, a portal 
- e heavenly mountain of Celestia might be located 
a mountain peak. 
- cond, portals often have guardians charged with 
illfing that undesirable people don't pass through. 
:;>ending on the portal's destination, "undesirable 
- pie·· might include evil characters, good characters, 
:ards, thieves, anyone wearing a robe, or any mortal 
-e ture. A portal's guardian is typically a powerful 
- · gical creature, such as a genie, sphinx, titan, or 
.-e of the portal's destination plane. 
-=-mally, most portals don't stand open all the time, 
_-open only in particular situations or when a certain 
_ ·rement is met. A portal can have any conceivable 
- ement, but the following are the most common: 
e. The portal functions only at particular times: 
ilfing a full moon on the Material Plane, or every ten 
y . or when the stars are in a particular position. 
nee it opens, such a portal remains open for a 
ired time, such as for three days following the full 
~n . or for an hour, or for ld4 + 1 rounds. 
--
ation. The portal functions only if a particular 
ondition is met. A situation-keyed portal opens 
on a clear night, or when it rains, or when a certain 
spell is cast in its vicinity . 
Random. A random portal functions for a random 
period, then shuts down for a similarly random 
duration. Typically, such a portal allows ld6 + 
6 travelers to pass through, then shuts down 
for ld6 days. 
Command Word. The portal functions only if a 
particular command word is spoken. Sometimes the 
word must be spoken as a character passes through 
the portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway, 
window, or similar opening). Other portals open when 
the command word is spoken and remain open for a 
short time. 
Key. The portal functions if the traveler is holding a 
particular object; the item acts much like a key to 
ll. door. This key item can be a common object or a 
particular key created for that portal. The city of Sigil 
above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors 
because it features an overwhelming number of such 
item-keyed portals. 
Learning and meeting a portal's requirements can 
draw characters into further adventures as they chase 
down a key item, scour old libraries for command 
words, or consult sages to find the right time 
to visit the portal.
