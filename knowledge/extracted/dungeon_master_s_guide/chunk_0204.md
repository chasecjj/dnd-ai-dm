CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
A failed Sanity save might result in short-term, long-
term, or indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, 
"Running the Game." Any time a character suffers from 
long-term or indefinite madness, the character's Sanity 
is reduced by 1. A greater restoration spell can restore 
Sanity lost in this way, and a character can increase his 
or her Sanity through level advancement. 
ADVENTURING OPTIONS 
This section provides options for changing how rests 
work, as well as for adding unusual things to your 
campaign, such as modern weapons. 
FEAR AND HORROR 
The rules for fear and horror can help you sustain an 
atmosphere of dread in a dark fantasy campaign. 
FEAR 
When adventurers confront threats they have no 
hope of overcoming, you can call for them to make a 
Wisdom saving throw. Set the DC according to the 
circumstances. A character who fails the save becomes 
frightened for 1 minute. The character can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of his or her turns, 
ending the effect on the character on a successful save. 
HORROR 
Horror involves more than simple fright. It entails 
revulsion and anguish. Often it arises when adventurer 
see something completely contrary to the common 
understanding of what can and should occur in the 
world, or upon the realization of a dreadful truth. 
In such a situation, you can call on characters to make 
a Charisma saving throw to resist the horror. Set the DC 
based on the magnitude of the horrific circumstances. 
On a failed save, a character gains a short-term or long-
term form of madness that you choose or determine 
randomly, as detailed in chapter 8, "Running the Game.-
HEALING 
These optional rules make it easier or harder for 
adventurers to recover from injury, either increasing 
or reducing the amount of time your players can spend 
adventuring before rest is required. 
HEALER'S KIT DEPENDENCY 
A character can't spend any Hit Dice after finishing a 
short rest until someone expends one use of a healer's 
kit to bandage and treat the character's wounds. 
HEALING SuRGES 
This optional rule allows characters to heal up in 
the thick of combat and works well for parties that 
feature few or no characters with healing magic, or for 
campaigns in which magical healing is rare. 
As an action, a character can use a healing surge and 
spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die 
spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the 
character's Constitution modifier. The character regains 
hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to 
spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

A character who uses a healing surge can't do so 
again until he or she finishes a short or long rest. 
Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent 
Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, 
a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level 
divided by four (minimum of one die). 
For a more superheroic feel, you can let a character 
use a healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as 
an action. 
SLOW NATURAL HEALING 
Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a long 
rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at 
the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest. 
This optional rule prolongs the amount of time that 
characters need to recover from their wounds without 
the benefits of magical healing and works well for 
grittier, more realistic campaigns. 
REST VARIANTS 
The rules for short and long rests presented in chapter 
8 of the Player's Handbook work well for a heroic-style 
campaign. Characters can go toe-to-toe with deadly foes, 
take damage to within an inch of their lives, yet still be 
ready to fight again the next day. If this approach doesn't 
fit your campaign, consider the following variants. 
EPIC HEROISM 
This variant uses a short rest of 5 minutes and a long 
rest of 1 hour. This change makes combat more routine, 
since characters can easily recover from every battle. 
You might want to make combat encounters more 
difficult to compensate. 
Spellcasters using this system can afford to burn 
through spell slots quickly, especially at higher levels. 
Consider allowing spellcasters to restore expended 
spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots 
(rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit 
spell slots restored to 5th level or lower. Only a full 
8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to restore all spell 
slots and to regain spell slots of 6th level or higher. 
GRITTY REALISM 
This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long 
rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, 
requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits 
and drawbacks of combat. Characters can't afford to 
engage in too many battles in a row. and all adventuring 
requires careful planning. 
This approach encourages the characters to 
spend time out of the dungeon. It" a good option for 
campaigns that emphasize intrigue. politics. and 
interactions among other PCs. and in which combat is 
rare or something to be avoided rather rhan rushed into. 
FIREARMS 
If you want to model the swa hbuckling r.yle of 
The Three Musketeers and imilar tale . you can 
introduce gunpowder weapon ro your campaign that 
are associated with the Renaissance. imilarly. in a 
campaign where a space hip h 
era bed or elements 
of modern-day Earth are pre en . fu uri tic or modern 
firearms might appear. The Firearms table provides 
examples of firearms from all three of those periods. 
The modern and futuristic items are priceless. 
PROFICIENCY 
It's up to you to decide whether a character has 
proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D 
worlds wouldn't have such proficiency. During their 
downtime, characters can use the training ru les in the 
Player's Handbook to acquire proficiency, assuming 
that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons 
working while mastering their use. 
PROPERTIES 
Firearms use special ammunition, and some of them 
have the burst fire or reload property. 
Ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is 
destroyed upon use. Renaissance and modern firearms 
use bullets. Futuristic firearms are powered by a 
special type of ammunition called energy cells. An 
energy cell contains enough power for all the shots its 
firearm can make. 
Burst Fire. A weapon that has the burst fire property 
can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 
10-foot-cube area within normal range with shots. Each 
creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage. This 
action uses ten pieces of ammunition. 
Reload. A limited number of shots can be made with 
a weapon that has the reload property. A character must 
then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the 
character's choice). 
EXPLOSIVES 
A campaign might include explosives from the 
Renaissance or the modern world (the latter are 
priceless), as presented in the Explosives table. 
BOMB 
As an action, a character can light this bomb and throw 
it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 
feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity 
saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage. 
GUNPOWDER 
Gunpowder is chiefly used to propel a bu 11et out of the 
barrel of a pistol or rifle, or it is formed into a bomb. 
Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs and in water-
resistant powder horns. 
Setting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause 
it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 
10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn, 7d6 for a keg). A 
successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the 
damage. Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes 
it to flare for 1 round, shedding bright light in a 30-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. 
DYNAMITE 
As an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite 
and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature 
within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
