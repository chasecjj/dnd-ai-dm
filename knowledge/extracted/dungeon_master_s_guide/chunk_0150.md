SPELLGUARD S H IELD 
Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement) 
While holding this shield, you have advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects, and 
spell attacks have disadvantage against you. 
SPHERE OF ANNIH ILATION 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the 
multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a 
magical field surrounding it. 
The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through 
and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the 
exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage 
from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the 
sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere 
but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 
force damage. 
The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. 
If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, 
you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one 
direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 
5 x your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a 
failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature 
whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 
13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 
4d10 force damage. 
If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another 
creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) 
check contested by the other creature's Intelligence 
(Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control 
of the sphere and can levitate it as normal. 
If the sphere comes into contact with a planar 
portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an 
extradimensional space, such as that within a portable 
hole, the DM determines randomly what happens, using 
the following table.

The sphere is destroyed.

The sphere moves through the portal or into the 
extradimensional space.

A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 
180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a 
random plane of existence. 
STAFF OF CHARMING 
Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, 
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard) 
While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 
1 of its 10 charges to cast charm person, command, or 
comprehend languages from it using your spell save DC. 
The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff. 
If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw 
against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you 
can turn your failed save into a successful one. You 
can't use this property of the staff again until the next

dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment 
spell that targets only you, with or without the staff's 
intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 
charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its 
caster as if you had cast the spell. 
The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, 
the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff. 
STAFF OF FIRE 
Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, 
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard) 
You have resistance to fire damage while you hold 
this staff. 
The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use 
an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one 
of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: 
burning hands (1 charge), fireball (3 charges), or wall of 
fire (4 charges). 
The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily 
at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On 
a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is 
destroyed.
