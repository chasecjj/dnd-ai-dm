Who or what is to blame for the loss? 
Describe an immediate consequence of the loss. 
Forecast one way that the loss impacts or changes 
the world in the long term. Who or what suffers the 
most as a result of the loss? Who or what benefits the 
most from it? 
7. NEW ORGANIZATION 
The foundation of a new order, kingdom, religion, 
society, cabal, or cult can shake the world with its 
actions, doctrine, dogma, and policies. On a local 
scale, a new organization contends with existing power 
groups, influencing, subverting, dominating, or allying 
with them to create a stronger base of power. Large 
and powerful organizations can exert enough influence 
to rule the world. Some new organizations benefit the 
populace, while others grow to threaten the civilization 
they once protected. 
Perhaps an important new organization arises in one 
part of your world. It could have humble or auspicious 
beginnings, but one thing is certain: it is destined to 
change the world as long as it progresses along its 
present course. Sometimes an organization's alignment 
is apparent from inception, but its morality can remain 
ambiguous until its doctrines, policies, and traditions 
are revealed over time. Choose the type of organization, 
or use the New Organizations table to generate ideas.

Then consider some or all of the following options: 
The new order supplants a current power group in 
the world, gaining territory, converts, or defectors and 
reducing the previous power group's numbers. Who or 
what does the foundation of this new order supplant? 
The new order appeals to a specific audience. Decide 
whether this order attracts a certain race, social class, 
or character class. 
The leader of this new order is known for a particular 
quality valued by his or her followers. Elaborate on 
why they respect him or her for this quality, and 
what actions this leader has taken to retain the 
followers' support. 
A rival group opposes the foundation of this new 
organization. Choose an existing power group from 
your campaign to oppose the new organization, or 
create one from the categories on the table. Decide 
why they oppose the new group, who leads them, and 
what they plan to do to stop their rival. 
8. DISCOVERY, EXPANSION, INVENTION 
Discoveries of new lands expand the map and change 
the boundaries of empires. Discoveries of new magic 
or technology expand the boundaries of what was once 
thought possible. New resources or archaeological finds 
create opportunity and wealth and set prospectors and 
power groups in motion to vie for their control. 
A new discovery-or rediscovery-can impact your 
campaign world in a meaningful way, shaping the 
course of history and the events of the age. Think of this 
discovery as a big adventure hook or series of hooks. 
This is also an opportunity to create a unique monster, 
item, god, plane, or race for your world. As long as the 
discovery matters, it doesn't have to be wholly original, 
just flavored for your campaign. 
A discovery is particularly impressive when the 
adventurers in your campaign are the ones who 
make it. If they discover a new mineral with magical 
properties, map a new land that's eminently suitable 
for colonization, or uncover an ancient weapon with 
the power to wreak devastation on your world, they 
are likely to set major events in motion. This gives 
the players the opportunity to see exactly how much 
influence their actions have on your world. 
Decide on the type of discovery that is made or use 
the Discoveries table to generate ideas.

Once you have determined the type of discovery, flesh 
it out by deciding exactly what it is, who discovered 
it, and what potential effect it could have on the 
world. Ideally, previous adventures in your campaign 
will help you fill in the blanks, but also keep the 
following in mind: 
This discovery benefits a particular person, group, or 
faction more than others. Who benefits most? Name 
three benefits they stand to gain from this discovery. 
This discovery directly harms another person, group, 
or faction. Who is harmed the most? 
• This discovery has consequences. Name three 
repercussions or side effects. Who ignores the 
repercussions? 
Name two or three individuals or factions struggling 
to possess or control this discovery. Who is likely to 
win? What do they stand to gain, and what are they 
willing to do to control the discovery?
