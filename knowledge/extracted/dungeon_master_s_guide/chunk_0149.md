SPELLGUARD 
SHIELD 
SHIELD, +1, +2, OR +3 
SHIELD OF MISSILE 
ATTRACTION 
Armor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very 
rare (+3) 
While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC 
determined by the shield's rarity. This bonus is in 
addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. 
SHIELD OF MISSILE ATTRACTIO N 
Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement) 
While holding this shield, you have resistance to 
damage from ranged weapon attacks. 
Curse. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses 
you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell 
or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the 
curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is 
made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse 
causes you to become the target instead. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
SLIPPERS OF SPIDER CLIMBING 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, 
down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down 
along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have 
a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Howeve-
the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a 
slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil. 
SOVEREIGN GLUE 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This viscous, milky-white substance can form a 
permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. 
It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated 
inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a containe; 
contains 1d6 + 1 ounces. 
One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square 
surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has 
done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the 
application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness. -
with a wish spell. 
SPELL SCROLL 
Scroll, varies 
A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written -
a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spellli 
you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spe 
without having to provide any of the spell's componen " 
Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. 
If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher 
level than you can normally cast, you must make an 
ability check using your spellcasting ability to determ· 
whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + 
spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears fro-
the scroll with no other effect. 
Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, 
and the scroll itself crumbles to dust. 
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the 
spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as th 
scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just 
as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is 
copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on 
an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 
+ the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is
