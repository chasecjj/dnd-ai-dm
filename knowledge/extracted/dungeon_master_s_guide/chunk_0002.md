PART 2: MASTER OF ADVENTURES 
Whether you write your own adventures or use 
published ones, expect to invest preparation time 
beyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You'll 
need to carve out some free time to exercise your 
creativity as you invent compelling plots, create new 
NPCs, craft encounters, and think of clever ways to 
foreshadow story events yet to come. 
Part 2 of this book is devoted to helping you create 
and run great adventures. Chapter 3 covers the basic 
elements of a D&D adventure, and chapter 4 helps you 
create memorable NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines 
and advice for running adventures set in dungeons, 
the wilderness, and other locales, and chapter 6 covers 
the time between adventures. Chapter 7 is all about 
treasure, magic items, and special rewards that help 
keep the players invested in your campaign. 
PART 3: MASTER OF RULES 
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS isn't a head-to-head competition, 
but it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the 
game to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the 
rules. As the player who creates the game world and the 
adventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural 
fit to take on the referee role. 
· 
As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator between the 
rules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or 
she wants to do, and the DM determines whether it is 
successful or not, in some cases asking the player to 
make a die roll to determine success. For example, if a 
player wants his or her character to take a swing at an 
ore, you say, "Make an attack roll" while looking up the 
ore's Armor Class. 
The rules don't account for every possible situation 
that might arise during a typical D&D session. For 
example, a player might want his or her character to 
hurl a brazier full of hot coals into a monster's face. 
How you determine the outcome of this action is up to 
you. You might tell the player to make a Strength check, 
while mentally setting the Difficulty Class (DC) at 15. 
If the Strength check is successful, you then determine 
how a face full of hot coals affects the monster. You 
might decide that it deals ld4 fire damage and imposes 
disadvantage on the monster's attack rolls until the end 
of its next turn. You roll the damage die (or let the player 
do it), and the game continues. 
Sometimes mediating the rules means setting limits. 
If a player tells you, "I want to run up and attack the 
ore," but the character doesn't have enough movement 
to reach the ore, you say, "It's too far away to move up 
and still attack. What would you like to do instead?" 
The player takes the information and comes up with a 
different plan. 
To referee the rules, you need to know them. You don't 
have to memorize this book or the Player's Handbook, 
but you should have a clear idea of their contents so that, 
when a situation requires a ruling, you know where to 
find the proper reference. 
The Player's Handbook contains the main rules you 
need to play the game. Part 3 of this book offers a wealth 
of information to help you adjudicate the rules in a wide 
variety of situations. Chapter 8 presents advice for using 
attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. It also 
includes options appropriate for certain play styles and 
campaigns, including guidelines for using miniatures, 
a system for handling chase scenes, and rules for 
madness. If you like to create your own stuff, such 
as new monsters, races, and character backgrounds, 
chapter 9 shows you how. That chapter also contains 
optional rules for unusual situations or play styles, such 
as the use of firearms in a fantasy setting.
