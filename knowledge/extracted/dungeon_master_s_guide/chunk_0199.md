PURCHASING POISON 
In some settings, strict laws prohibit the possession 
and use of poison, but a black-market dealer or 
unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. 
Characters with criminal contacts might be able to 
acquire poison relatively easily. Other characters might 
have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before 
they track down the poison they seek. 
The Poisons table gives suggested prices for single 
doses of various poisons. 
CRAFTING AND HARVESTING POISO -
During downtime between adventures, a character 
can use the crafting rules in the Player's Handbook to 
create basic poison if the character has proficiency with 
a poisoner's kit At your discretion, the character can 
craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients 
are available for purchase, and tracking down certain 
ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure. 
A character can instead attempt to harvest poison 
from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or 
carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or 
dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed 
by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency 
with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the 
character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a 
successful check, the character harvests enough poison 
for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is 
unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the 
check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the 
creature's poison. 
MADNESS 
In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad 
by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict 
day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an 
adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign 
has a strong horror theme, you might want to use 
madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing
