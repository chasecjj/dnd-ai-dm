PuTTING EvENTS IN MoTION 
--------
World-shaking events can happen at any time in 
a campaign or story arc, but the biggest incidents 
naturally fall at the beginning, middle, and end 
of a story. 
That placement reflects the structure of dramatic 
stories. At the beginning of a story, something happens 
to shake the protagonists' world and spur them into 
action. The characters take action to resolve their 
problems, but other forces oppose them. As they reach a 
significant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict 
disrupts the characters' plans, shaking their world 
again; failure seems imminent. At the end of the story, 
they succeed or fail, and the world is shaken again by 
the way the characters changed it for good or ill. 
At the beginning of a D&D campaign, world-shaking 
events create instant adventure hooks and affect the 
characters' lives directly. In the middle, they make great 
turning points as the characters' fortunes reverse-
rising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near 
the end of a campaign, such events serve as excellent 
climactic episodes with far-reaching effects. They might 
even occur after the story has ended, as a result of the 
characters' actions. 
WHEN NoT To SHAKE IT UP -----
In constructing a narrative, beware of "false action," 
or action for its own sake. False action doesn't move 
a story forward, engage characters, or cause them to 
change. Many action movies suffer from false action, in 
which car chases, gunfights, and explosions abound but 
do little more than inconvenience the characters and 
eventually bore the audience with their repetition and 
dearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&D campaigns fall 
into the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters 
together one after another with little impact on the 
characters or the world. Thus, it's probably not in the 
DM's best interest to reorder the world every single time 
there's a lull in the action, lest world-shaking events 
become ordinary. 
As a general rule, a campaign can sustain up to 
three large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the 
beginning, one near the middle, and one near the 
end. Use as many small-scale events that disturb the 
bounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, fiefs, 
duchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every 
significant event shakes someone's ·world, after all, no 
matter how small that world might be. Let unexpected 
and terrible events regularly afflict the world's smaller 
territories, but unless your story demands it, save the 
large-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most 
important moments of your campaign. 
WORLD-SHAKING EVENTS -------
You can use this section for ideas and inspiration to 
expand on world-shaking events already occurring (or 
oon to occur) within your world. Alternatively, you can 
roll on the tables below to randomly generate an event 
to inspire your imagination. The attempt to justify a 
random result can reveal unforeseen possibilities. 
To get started, select a world-shaking event category 
or roll on the World-Shaking Events table.

1-2. RISE OR FALL OF A LEADER OR AN ERA 
Eras are often defined by the prominent leaders, 
innovators, and tyrants of the day. These people change 
the world and etch their signatures indelibly on the 
pages of history. When they rise to power, they shape 
the time and place where they live in monumental ways. 
When they fall from power or pass away, the ghost of 
their presence lingers. 
Determine the kind of leader that influences the new 
or passing era. You can choose the type of leader or 
determine one randomly using the Leader Types table.

Political leaders are monarchs, nobles, and chiefs. 
Religious leaders include deities' avatars, high priests, 
and messiahs, as well as those in charge of monasteries 
and leaders of influential religious sects. Major military 
leaders control the armed forces of countries. They 
include military dictators, warlords, and the heads of 
a ruler's war council. Minor military leaders include 
the heads of local militias, gangs, and other martial 
organizations. At the broadest scale, a criminal or 
underworld leader wields power through a network of 
spies, bribes, and black-market trade. On the smallest 
scale, these are local gang bosses, pirate captains, and 
brigands. A leader in art or culture is a virtuoso whose 
work reflects the spirit of the age and changes the way 
people think: a prominent playwright, bard, or court fool 
in whose words, art, or performance the people perceive 
universal truth. On a smaller scale, this might be an 
influential local poet, minstrel, satirist, or sculptor. 
A major leader in philosophy, learning, or magic is 
a genius philosopher, a counselor to emperors, an 
enlightened thinker, the head of the highest institution 
of learning in the world, or an archmage. A minor leader
