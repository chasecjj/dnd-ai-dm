more·concerned about doing right by the adventurers, 
honoring any obligations without worrying too much 
about personal risk or adherence to the law. 
SPECIAL RIGHTS 
A politically powerful person can reward characters by 
giving them special rights, which are usually articulated 
in some sort of official document. For example, 
characters might be granted special rights to carry 
weapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or 
negotiate on a duke's behalf. They might earn the right 
to demand free room and board from any establishment 
within a particular community, or have the right to draft 
local militia to assist them as needed. 
Special rights last only as long as the legal document 
dictates, and such rights can be revoked if the 
adventurers abuse them. 
STRONGHOLDS 
A stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned 
adventurers who demonstrate unwavering fealty to a" 
powerful political figure or ruling body, such as a king, 
a knighthood, or a council of wizards. A stronghold 
can be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of 
a city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While 
the stronghold is for the characters to govern as they 
see fit, the land on which it sits remains the property of 
the crown or local ruler. Should the characters prove 
disloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or 
forced to relinquish custody of the stronghold. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
As an additional reward, the individual bequeathing 
the stronghold might offer to pay its maintenance cost 
for a period of one or more months, after which the 
characters inherit that responsibility. See chapter 6 for 
more information on stronghold maintenance. 
TITLES 
A politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense 
titles. A title often comes with a parcel of land (see 
above). For example, a character might be awarded the 
title Earl of Storm river or Countess of Dun Fjord, along 
with a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region 
of the same name. 
A character can hold more than one title, and in a 
feudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or 
distributed among) one's children. While a character 
holds a title, he or she is expected to act in a manner 
befitting that title. By decree, titles can be stripped away 
if the local ruler or ruling body has reason to question 
the character's loyalty or competence. 
ALTERNATIVES TO EPIC BOONS 
You might decide to grant one of the following rewards to a 
20th-level character, instead of awarding an epic boon. These 
two options can be awarded to a character more than once. 
Ability Score Improvement. The character can increase one 
ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by l each. 
The ability score can now be increased above 20, up to a 
maximum of 30. 
New Feat. The character gains a new feat chosen by the 
player, but subject to your approval.

TRAINING 
A character might be offered pecial training in lieu of 
a financial reward. This kind of training isn't widely 
available and thus is highly desirable. It presumes 
the existence of a skilled trainer-perhaps a retired 
adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a 
mentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or 
haughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor, the 
knight-commander of the King's Guard, the leader of 
a powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a 
remote mountaintop pagoda, a barbarian chieftain, a 
warlock living among nomads as a fortune-teller, or an 
absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known 
throughout the land. 
A character who agrees to training as a reward must 
spend downtime with the trainer (see chapter 6 for 
more information on downtime activities). In exchange, 
the character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit. 
Possible training benefits include the following: 
The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for 
ld4 + 6 days. 
• The character gains proficiency in a skill. 
The character gains a feat. 
EPIC BOONS 
An epic boon is a special power available only to 20th 
level characters. Characters at that level gain such 
boons only if you want them to and only when you feel 
it's appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after 
the characters complete a major quest, or accomplish 
something else particularly notable. A character might 
gain an epic boon after destroying an evil artifact, 
defeating an ancient dragon, or halting an incursion 
from the Outer Planes. 
Epic boons can also be used as a form of 
advancement, a way to provide greater power to 
characters who have no more levels to gain. With this 
approach, consider awarding one epic boon to each 
character for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above 
355,000 XP. 
You determine which epic boon a character gains. 
Ideally, the boon you pick is something the character 
would put to use in future adventures. You can allow a 
player to select a boon for his or her character, subject to 
your approval. 
Whatever boon a character ends up with, consider its 
place in your story and world. Many of the boons are 
extraordinary and represent the gradual transformation 
of a character into something resembling a demigod. 
The acquisition of a boon might visibly transform a 
character. For example, the eyes of a character with 
the Boon of True sight might glow when he or she feels 
strong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of 
High Magic might have faint motes of light glimmering 
around his or her head. Also, decide how the boon first 
appears. Does the boon appear spontaneously and 
mysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest 
to bestow it? The bestowal of a boon can itself be an 
exciting scene in an adventure. 
The text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon 
says otherwise, a character can't gain it more than once.
