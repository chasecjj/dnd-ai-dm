Have another player run the missing player's 
character. The player running the extra character 
should strive to keep the character alive and use 
resources wisely. 
• Run the character yourself. It's an extra burden for 
you, but it can work. 
• Decide the character isn't there. Invent a good reason 
for the character to miss the adventure, perhaps 
by having him or her linger in town or continue a 
downtime activity. Leave a way for the character to 
rejoin the party when the player returns. 
Have the character fade into the background. This 
solution requires everyone to step out of the game 
world a bit and suspend disbelief, but might be the 
easiest solution. You act as if the character's not there, 
but don't try to come up with any in-game explanation 
for this absence. Monsters don't attack the character, 
who returns the favor. On returning, the player 
resumes playing as if he or she was never gone. 
SMALL GROUPS 
Most of the time, each player runs one character. 
The game plays best that way, without overwhelming 
anyone. But if your group is small, players can control 
more than one character. Or you can fill out the group 
with NPC followers, using the guidelines in chapter 4, 
"Creating Nonplayer Characters." You can also make 
the characters more resilient by using the healing surge 
option in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop." 
Don't force a reluctant player to take on multiple 
characters, and don't show favoritism by allowing only 
one player to do so. If one character is the mentor of 
the other, the player can focus on roleplaying just one 
character. Otherwise, players can end up awkwardly 
talking to themselves in character, or avoiding 
roleplaying altogether. 
Multiple characters can be a good idea in a game 
that features nonstop peril and a high rate of character 
death. If your group agrees to the premise, have each 
player keep one or two additional characters on hand, 
ready to jump in whenever the current character dies. 
Each time the main character gains a level, the backup 
characters do as well. 
NEW PLAYERS ------
When a new player joins the group, allow the new 
player to create a character of a level equal to the 
lowest-level member of the party. The only exception 
to this guideline is when the new player is completely 
unfamiliar with the D&D game. In that case, have that 
player start with a 1st-level character. If the rest of tlie 
party is significantly higher in level, consider taking a 
short break from the campaign and having everyone 
play a 1st-level character for a few sessions while the 
new player learns the ropes. 
Integrating a new character into the group can be 
difficult if the party is in the middle of an adventure. The 
following approaches can help make it easier: 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE. GAME 
The new character is a friend or relative of one of the 
adventurers who has been searching for the group. 
• The new character is a prisoner of the foes the other 
characters are fighting. When rescued, this character 
joins their group. 
The new character is the sole survivor of another 
adventuring group. 
THE ROLE OF DICE 
Dice are neutral arbiters. They can determine the 
outcome of an action without assigning any motivation 
to the DM and without playing favorites. The extent to 
which you use them is entirely up to you. 
ROLLING WITH IT 
Some DMs rely on die rolls for almost everything. Whe 
a character attempts a task, the DM calls for a check a 
picks a DC. As a DM using this style, you can't rely on 
the characters succeeding or failing on any one check 
to move the action in a specific direction. You must be 
ready to improvise and react to a changing situation. 
Relying on dice also gives the players the sense that 
anything is possible. Sure, it might seem unlikely that 
the party's hal fling can leap on the ogre's back, pull a 
sack over its head, and then dive to safety, but with a 
lucky enough roll it just might work. 
A drawback of this approach is that roleplaying 
can diminish if players feel that their die rolls, rather 
than their decisions and characterizations, always 
determine success. 
IGNORING THE DICE 
One approach is to use dice as rarely as possible. Some 
DMs use them only during combat, and determine 
success or failure as they like in other situations. 
With this approach, the DM decides whether an action 
or a plan succeeds or fails based on how well the player: 
make their case, how thorough or creative they are, or 
other factors. For example, the players might describe 
how they search for a secret door, detailing how they 
tap on a wall or twist a torch sconce to find its trigger. 
That could be enough to convince the DM that they 
find the secret door without having to make an ability 
check to do so. 
This approach rewards creativity by encouraging 
players to look to the situation you've described for an 
answer, rather than looking to their character sheet or 
their character's special abilities. A downside is that no 
DM is completely neutral. ADM might come to favor 
certain players or approaches, or even work against 
good ideas if they send the game in a direction he or she 
doesn't like. This approach can also slow the game if the 
DM focuses on one "correct" action that the characters 
must describe to overcome an obstacle. 
THE MIDDLE PATH 
Many DMs find that using a combination of the two 
approaches works best. By balancing the use of dice 
against deciding on success, you can encourage your 
players to strike a balance between relying on their
