CREATING ENCOUNTERS 
:::ncounters are the individual scenes in the larger story 
of your adventure. 
First and foremost, an encounter should be fun for 
~he players. Second, it shouldn't be burden for you to 
:un. Beyond that, a well-crafted encounter usually has 
a straightforward objective as well as some connection 
to the overarching story of your campaign, building on 
the encounters that precede it while foreshadowing 
encounters yet to come. 
An encounter has one of three possible outcomes: 
!he characters succeed, the characters partly succeed, 
or the characters faiL The encounter needs to account 
for all three possibilities, and the outcome needs to 
have consequences so that the players feel like their 
successes and failures matter. 
CHARACTER OBJECTIVES 
When players don't know what they're supposed to do 
in a given encounter, anticipation and excitement can 
quickly turn to boredom and frustration. A transparent 
objective alleviates the risk of players losing interest. 
For example, if the overall story of your adventure 
involves a quest to deliver a priceless relic to a remote 
monastery, each encounter along the way is an 
opportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves 
the quest forward. Encounters during the trip might 
see the adventurers accosted by enemies determined 
to steal the relic, or by monsters that are constantly 
threatening the monastery. 
Some players create their own objectives, which is to 
be expected and encouraged. It is, after all, as much the 
players' campaign as yours. For example, a character 
might try to bribe enemies rather than fight them, 
or chase after a fleeing enemy to see where it goes. 
Players who ignore objectives will have to deal with 
the consequences, which is another important facet of 
encounter design.

~ ~e io owing objectiYes can be u ed as fou ndations 
for encounter . Although these objectives focus on a 
single encounter during an adventure, using the same 
objective in multiple encounters allows you to combine 
those encounters into a larger obstacle or problem the 
adventurers must overcome. 
Make Peace. The characters must convince two 
opposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict 
that embroils them. As a complication, the characters 
might have enemies on one or both of the opposing 
sides, or some other group or individual might be 
instigating the conflict to further its own ends. 
Protect an NPC or Object. The characters must act 
as bodyguards or protect some object in their custody. 
As a complication, the NPC under the party's protection 
might be cursed, diseased, prone to panic attacks, too 
young or too old to fight, or apt to risk the lives of the 
adventurers through dubious decisions. The object the 
adventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient, 
cursed, or difficult to transport. 
Retrieve an Object. The adventurers must gain 
possession of a specific object in the area of the 
encounter, preferably before combat finishes. As a 
complication, enemies might desire the object as much 
as the adventurers do, forcing both parties to fight for it. 
Run a Gauntlet. The adventurers must pass through 
a dangerous area. This objective is similar to retrieving 
an object insofar as reaching the exit is a higher priority 
than killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a 
complication, as does a decision point that might lead 
characters astray. Other complications include traps, 
hazards, and monsters. 
Sneak In. The adventurers need to move through the 
encounter area without making their enemies aware 
of their presence. Complications might ensue if they 
are detected. 
Stop a Ritual. The plots of evil cult leaders, 
malevolent warlocks, and powerful fiends often involve 
rituals that must be foiled. Characters engaged in 
stopping a ritual must typically fight their way through 
evil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual's 
powerful magic. As a complication, the ritual might 
be close to completion when the characters arrive, 
imposing a time limit. Depending on the ritual, its 
completion might have immediate consequences as welL 
Take Out a Single Target. The villain is surrounded 
by minions powerful enough to kill the adventurers. 
The characters can flee and hope to confront the villain 
another day, or they can try to fight their way through 
the minions to take out their target. As a complication, 
the minions might be innocent creatures under the 
villain's controL Killing the villain means breaking that 
control, but the adventurers must endure the minions' 
attacks until they do. 
CREATING A COMBAT ENCOUNTER 
When creating a combat encounter, let your imagination 
run wild and build something your players will enjoy. 
Once you have the details figured out, use this section to 
adjust the difficulty of the encounter.
