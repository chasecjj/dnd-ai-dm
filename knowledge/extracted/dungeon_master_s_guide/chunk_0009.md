MAPPING YouR CAMPAIGN 
When creating the world where your campaign takes 
place, you'll want a map. You can take one of two 
approaches with it: top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs 
like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the 
world at the start of the campaign by having a map 
that shows whole continents, and then zooming in on 
smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite 
direction, starting with a small campaign area that is 
mapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming 
out as adventures take the characters into new territory. 
Whichever approach you take, hexes work well for 
mapping outdoor environments where travel can go 
in any direction and calculating distance might be 
important. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to 
the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map 
that's best suited to the level of detail you want. Chapter 
7 offers more information about creating and mapping 
wilderness areas. 
PROVINCE SCALE 
For the most detailed areas of your world, use a 
province scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A 
full-page map at this scale represents an area that 
can be covered in one day's travel in any direction 
from the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As 
such, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a 
campaign's starting area (see "Creating a Campaign," 
later in this chapter) or any location where you expect 
to track the adventurers' movement in hours rather 
than days. 
• 
The ground cover of an area this size will include 
broad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken 
up by other isolated terrain types. 
A settled region mapped at this scale might have one 
town and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets. 
A wilder region might have only a single keep, or no 
settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of 
the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. 
On a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few 
hexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even 
small villages farm most of the arable land within a 
mile or two. 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
KINGDOM SCALE 
On a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. 
A map at this scale covers a large region, about the size 
of Great Britain or half the size of the state of California. 
That's plenty of room for adventuring. 
The first step of mapping a region at this scale is to 
sketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water 
in the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A 
coastal region might include islands offshore, and a 
landlocked area might include an inland sea or major 
lakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single 
large island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple 
coastlines. 
Next, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills 
form a transition between the mountains and lowlands, 
and broad patches of gentle hills might dot the region. 
That leaves the rest of your map for relatively fiat 
terrain: grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place 
these elements as you see fit. 
Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through 
the area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas 
that see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest 
major body of water that doesn't require the river to 
cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as 
they grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea. 
Finally, place the major towns and cities of the region. 
At this scale, you don't need to worry about small towns 
and villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland. 
Even so, a settled region this size might easily have 
eight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map. 
CONTINENT SCALE 
For mapping a whole continent, use a scale where 
1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can't 
see more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest 
mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political 
boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how 
multiple kingdom-scale maps fit together, rather than 
tracking the movement of adventurers day by day. 
The same process you use for mapping a region at 
kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. 
A continent might have eight to twelve large cities that 
deserve a place on the map, most likely major trade 
centers and the capitals of kingdoms. 
COMBINING SCALES 
--~--------------
Whichever scale you start with, it's easy to zoom in or 
out on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents 
the same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities 
that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent 
map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, 
and might define the opposite ends of the region you're 
detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province-
scale hexes, so it's easy to put the region covered by your 
province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale 
map and create interesting areas around it.
