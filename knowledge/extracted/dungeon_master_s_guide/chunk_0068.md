CHAPTER 4: CREATING NONPLAYER CHARACTERS 
NONPLAYER CHARACTER IS ANY CHARACTER 
controlled by the Dungeon Master. NPCs can 
be enemies or allies, regular folk or named 
monsters. They include the local innkeeper, 
the old wizard who lives in the tower on the 
outskirts of town, the death knight out to 
destroy the kingdom, and the dragon counting gold in its 
cavernous lair. 
This chapter shows you how to flesh out non player 
characters for your game. For guidelines on generating 
monster-like stat blocks for an NPC, see chapter 9, 
-Dungeon Master's Workshop." 
DESIGNING NPCs 
_ ·othing brings your adventures and campaigns to life 
better than a cast of well-developed NPCs. That said, 
_ 'PCs in your game rarely need as much complexity 
a a well-crafted character in a novel or movie. Most 
_ 'PCs are bit players in the campaign, whereas the 
adventurers are the stars. 
QuicK NPCs 
An NPC doesn't need combat statistics unless it poses 
a rhreat. Moreover, most NPCs need only one or two 
qualities to make them memorable. For example, 
:our players will have no trouble remembering the 
no-nonsense blacksmith with the tattoo of the black rose 
on his right shoulder or the badly dressed bard with the 
broken nose. 
DETAILED NPCs 
For NPCs who play larger roles in your adventures, 
allow more time to flesh out their histories and 
personalities. As you'll see, ten sentences can sum up 
he main elements of a memorable NPC, one sentence 
·or each of the following: 
Occupation and history 
Appearance 
Abilities 
Talent 
Mannerism 
Interactions with others 
Useful knowledge 
Ideal 
Bond 
Flaw or secret 
Although the material here focuses on humanoid 
_·pes, you can adjust details to create monstrous 
_ 'PCs as well. 
OCCUPATION AND HISTORY 
In one sentence, describe the NPC's occupation 
and provide a brief historical note that hints at the 
character's past. For example, the NPC might have 
-erved in an army, been imprisoned for a crime, or 
adventured years ago. 
APPEARANCE 
In one sentence, describe the NPC's most distinctive 
physical features. You can roll on the NPC Appearance 
table or choose a feature that suits the character.
