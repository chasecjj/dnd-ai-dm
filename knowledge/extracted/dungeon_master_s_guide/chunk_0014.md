electrum pieces are moons, gold pieces are dragons, 
and platinum coins are suns. The city's two local coins 
are the toal and the harbor moon. The toal is a square 
brass trading-coin pierced with a central hole to permit 
it to be easily strung on a ring or string, worth 2 gp in 
the city and nothing outside Waterdeep. The harbor 
moon is a flat crescent of platinum with a central 
hole and an electrum inlay, named for its traditional 
use in the docks for buying large amounts of cargo at 
once. The coin is worth 50 gp in Waterdeep and 30 gp 
elsewhere. 
The northern city of Silverymoon mints a crescent-
shaped, shining blue coin called an electrum moon, 
worth 1 gp in that city and 1 ep elsewhere. The city also 
issues a larger coin called an eclipsed moon, which 
looks like an electrum moon combined a darker silver 
wedge to form a round coin worth 5 ep within the city 
and 2 ep outside it. 
The favored form of currency in the kingdom of 
Cormyr is the royal coinage of the court, stamped with 
a dragon on one side and a treasury date mark on the 
other. There, coppers are called thumbs, silvers are 
silver falcons, electrum pieces are blue eyes, gold pieces 
are golden lions, and platinum coins are tricrowns. 
Even city-states mint their own copper, silver, and gold 
pieces. Electrum and platinum pieces are rarer in these 
lands. Smaller states use coinage borrowed from other 
nations and looted from ancient sources. Travelers from 
certain lands (notably the wizard-dominated realms of 
Thay and Halruaa) use the currencies of other realms 
when trading abroad because their own coins and 
tokens are feared to be magically cursed, and so are 
shunned by others. 
Conversely, the coins of long-lost, legendary lands 
and centers of great magic are honored, though those 
who find them are wise to sell them to collectors rather 
than merely spending them in markets. The coins of the 
old elven court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous: 
thalvers (coppers), bedoars (silvers), thammarchs 
(electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils (platinum). 
These coins are fine, numerous, and sometimes still 
used in trade among elves.

CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
Trade Bars. Large numbers of coins can be difficult 
to transport and account for. Many merchants prefer 
to use trade bars-ingots of precious metals and alloys 
(usually silver) likely to be accepted by virtually anyone. 
Trade bars are stamped or graven with the symbol of the 
trading company or government that originally crafted 
them. These bars are valued by weight, as follows: 
• A 2-pound silver bar is worth 10 gp and is about 5 
inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1/2 inch thick. 
A 5-pound silver bar is worth 25 gp and is about 6 
inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. 
A 5-pound gold bar is worth 250 gp and is about the 
size of a 2-pound silver bar. 
The city of Baldur's Gate mints large numbers of 
silver trade bars and sets the standard for this form of 
currency. The city of Mirabar issues black iron spindle-
shaped trade bars with squared ends weighing about 
2 pounds each, worth 10 gp in that city, markedly less 
in nearby trade centers, and as iron is normally valued 
elsewhere (1 sp per pound). 
Odd Currency. Coins and bars aren't the only forms 
of hard currency. Gond bells are small brass bells worth 
10 gp in trade, or 20 gp to a temple of Gond. Shaar 
rings, pierced and polished slices of ivory threaded 
onto strings by the nomads of the Shaar, are worth 3 gp 
per slice. 
CREATING YouR OwN 
As shown in the previous examples, currency doesn't 
need to obey a universal standard in your world. Each 
country and era can have its own coins with its own 
values. Your adventurers might travel through many 
different lands and find long-lost treasures. Finding 
· six hundred ancient bed oars from the rule of Coronal 
Eltargrim twelve centuries before offers a deeper sense 
of immersion in your world than finding 60 sp. 
Varying names and descriptions of coins for the 
major contemporary and historical realms of your world 
adds an additional layer of texture. The golden lions of 
Cormyr convey the noble nature of that kingdom. If a 
nation mints gold coins stamped with leering demonic 
faces and called torments, that currency expresses a 
distinct flavor. 
Creating new coins connected to specific locations, 
like the toals ofWaterdeep or the eclipsed moons of 
Silverymoon, provides another level of detail. As long as 
you keep the value of these new coins simple (in other 
words, don't invent a coin worth 1.62 gp), you add local 
flavor to key locations in your world without adding 
undue complexity. 
LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS 
When fleshing out your world, you can create new 
languages and dialects to reflect its unique geography 
and history. You can replace the default languages 
presented in the Player's Handbook with new ones, or 
split languages up into several different dialects. 
In some worlds, regional differences might be much 
more important than racial ones. Perhaps all the 
dwarves, elves, and humans who live in one kingdom 
speak a common language, which is completely different
