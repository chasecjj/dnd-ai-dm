THIN leE 
Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 x 10 pounds per 
10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an 
area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area 
breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through. 
FORAGING 
Characters can gather food and water as the party 
travels at a normal or slow pace. A foraging character 
makes a Wisdom (Survival) check whenever you call for 
it, with the DC determined by the abundance of food and 
water in the region.

If multiple characters forage, each character makes 
a separate check. A foraging character finds nothing 
on a failed check. On a successful check, roll ld6 +the 
character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much 
food (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll 
for water (in gallons). 
FooD AND WATER 
The food and water requirements noted in the Player's 
Handbook are for characters. Horses and other 
creatures require different quantities of food and water 
per day based on their size. Water needs are doubled if 
the weather is hot.

BECOMING LOST 
Unless they are following a path, or something like it, 
adventurers traveling in the wilderness run the risk of 
becoming lost. The party's navigator makes a Wisdom 
(Survival) check when you decide it's appropriate, 
against a DC determined by the prevailing terrain, as 
shown on the Wilderness Navigation table. If the party 
is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus 
to the check, and a fast pace imposes a - 5 penalty. If the 
party has an accurate map of the region or can see the 
sun or stars, the navigator has advantage on the check.

If the Wisdom (Survival) check succeeds, the party 
travels in the desired direction without becoming lost. 
If the check fails, the party inadvertently travels in the 
wrong direction and becomes lost. The party's navigator 
can repeat the check after the party spends ld6 hours 
trying to get back on course.

A village, town, or city makes an excellent backdrop for 
an adventure. The adventurers might be called on to 
track down a criminal who's gone into hiding, solve a 
murder, take out a gang of wererats or doppelgangers, 
or protect a settlement under siege. 
When creating a settlement for your campaign, focus 
on the locations that are most relevant to the adventure. 
Don't worry about naming every street and identifying 
the inhabitants of every building; that way lies madness. 
RANDOM SETTLEMENTS 
The following tables allow you to quickly create a 
settlement. They assume that you've already determined 
its size and its basic form of government.
