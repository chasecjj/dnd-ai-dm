or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit 
splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase 
separately. Run a round of one chase, then a round of 
the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each 
separate group. 
MAPPING THE CHASE 
If you have the opportunity to plan out a chase, take 
the time to draw a rough map that shows the route. 
Insert obstacles at specific points, especially ones that 
require the characters to make ability checks or saving 
throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random 
table of complications similar to the ones in this section. 
Otherwise, improvise as you play. 
Complications can be barriers to progress or 
opportunities for mayhem. Characters being chased 
through a forest by bugbears might spot a wasp nest 
and slow down long enough to attack the nest or throw 
rocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers. 
A map of a chase can be linear or have many 
branches, depending on the nature of the chase. For 
example, a mine cart chase might have few (if any) 
branches, while a sewer chase might have several. 
ROLE REVERSAL 
During a chase, it's possible for the pursuers to become 
the quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief 
through a marketplace might draw unwanted attention 
from other members of the thieves' guild. As they 
pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves 
pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and 
run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, 
the fleeing thief might run into the waiting arms of his 
accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide 
to flee with the thieves in pursuit. 
SIEGE EQUIPMENT 
Siege weapons are designed to assail castles and other 
walled fortifications. They see much use in campaigns 
that feature war. Most siege weapons don't move around 
a battlefield on their own; they require creatures to move 
them, as well as to load, aim, and fire them. 
BALLISTA 
Large object 
Armor Class: 15 
Hit Points: 50 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 
A ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. 
Before it can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It 
takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, 
and one action to fire it. 
Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 
ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3dl0) piercing damage. 
CANNON 
Large object 
Armor Class: 19 
Hit Points: 75 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 
A cannon uses gunpowder to propel heavy balls of cast 
iron through the air at destructive speeds. In a campaign 
without gunpowder, a cannon might be an arcane device 
built by clever gnomes or wizardly engineers. 
A cannon is usually supported in a wooden frame 
with wheels. Before it can be fired, the cannon must 
be loaded and aimed. It takes one action to load the 
weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. 
Cannon Ball. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to 
hit, range 600/2,400 ft., one target. Hit: 44 (8d10) 
bludgeoning damage. 
CAULDRON, SUSPENDED 
Large object 
Armor Class: 19 
Hit Points: 20 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 
A cauldron is an iron pot suspended so that it can be 
tipped easily, spilling its contents. Once emptied, a 
cauldron must be refilled-and its contents must usually 
be reheated- before it can be used again. It takes three 
actions to fill a cauldron and one action to tip it. 
Cauldrons can be filled with other liquids, such as 
acid or green slime, with different effects. 
Boiling Oil. The cauldron pours boiling oil onto a 
10-foot-square area directly below it. Any creature in the 
area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
MANGONEL 
Large object 
Armor Class: 15 
Hit Points: 100 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 
A mangonel is a type of catapult that hurls heavy 
projectiles in a high arc. This payload can hit targets 
behind cover. Before the mangonel can be fired, it must 
be loaded and aimed. It takes two actions to load the 
weapon, two actions to aim it, and one action to fire it. 
A mangonel typically hurls a heavy stone, although it 
can hurl other kinds of projectiles, with different effects. 
Mangone} Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 
range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), 
one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage. 
RAM 
Large object 
Armor Class: 15 
Hit Points: 100 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 
A ram consists of a movable gallery equipped with a 
heavy log suspended from two roof beams by chains. 
The log is shod in iron and used to batter through doors 
and barricades. 
It takes a minimum of four Medium creatures to 
operate a ram. Because of the gallery roof, these 
operators have total cover against attacks from above. 
Ram. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
object. Hit: 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage.
