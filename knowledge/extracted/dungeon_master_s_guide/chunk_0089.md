an effect that changes over time. or otherwi e produce a 
dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be 
detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways. 
For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly 
flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap's turn, 
the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is 
completely flooded. 
SAMPLE TRAPS 
The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary 
in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order. 
COLLAPSING ROOF 
Mechanical trap 
This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports 
keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place. 
The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches 
between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip 
wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using 
thieves' tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A 
character without thieves' tools can attempt this check 
with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged 
tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers. 
Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine 
that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, 
a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap 
to trigger. 
The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, 
and anyone who can see it can tell that it's in danger 
of collapse. 
When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling 
collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable 
section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once 
the trap is \riggered, the floor of the area is filled with 
rubble and becomes difficult terrain. 
FALLING ~~T 
Mechanical trap 
This trap uses\ trip wire to release a net suspended 
from the ceiling\ 
. 
The trip wire,is'J~nches off the ground and stretches 
between two column~r trees. The net is hidden by 
cobwebs or foliage. The IJC to spot the trip wire and net 
is 10. A successful DC 15 D~~rity check using thieves' 
tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character 
without thieves' tools can attem~ this check with 
disadvantage using any edged wea!'lon or edged tool. On 
a failed check, the trap triggers. 
When the trap is triggered, the net is released, 
covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are 
trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail 
a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. 
A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength 
check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach 
on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. 
Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 
5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped 
in that section.

Magic trap 
This trap is activated when an in-
de- tep on a 
hidden pressure plate, relea ina a magical gout of flame 
from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, 
including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell. 
The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as 
faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or 
other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such 
as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic 
around the statue. 
The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of 
weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the 
statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature 
in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 
Wedging an iron spike or other object under the 
pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A 
successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue 
destroys the trap. 
PITS 
Mechanical trap 
Four basic pit traps are presented here. 
Simple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the 
ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on 
the pit's edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris. 
The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the 
cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, 
taking damage based on the pit's depth (usually 10 feet, 
but some pits are deeper). 
Hidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from 
material identical to the floor around it. 
A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check 
discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section 
of floor that forms the pit's cover. A successful DC 
15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to 
confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the 
cover of a pit. 
When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open 
like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the 
pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can 
be deeper. 
Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar 
object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the 
surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover 
from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover 
can also be magically held shut using the arcane lock 
spell or similar magic. 
Locking Pit. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit 
trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers 
the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, 
the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside. 
A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to 
pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open 
(determine the cover's statistics using the guidelines 
in chapter 8). A character in the pit can also attempt to 
disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC
