USEFUL MAPS 
A good adventure needs thoughtfully constructed 
maps. Wilderness areas sprinkled with interesting 
landmarks and other features are better than vast 
expanses of unchanging terrain. Dungeons that have 
branching corridors and similar decision points give 
players the opportunity to choose which direction their 
characters should go. Presenting the characters with 
options allows the players to make choices that keep the 
adventure unpredictable. 
If drawing maps isn't your strong suit, the Internet is 
a great place to look for adventure maps that have been 
made freely available for use, as well as floor plans of 
real-world buildings and images that can inspire your 
mapmaking. You can also use software to help put your 
maps together. 
PUBLISHED ADVENTURES 
Published adventures are available for purchase if you 
have neither the time nor the inclination to write an 
adventure of your own, or if you want a change of pace. 
A published adventure includes a pregenerated scenario 
with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need 
to run it. An example of a published adventure appears 
in the D&D Starter Set. 
You can make adjustments to a published adventure 
so that it better suits your campaign and appeals to 
your players. For example, you can replace the villain 
of an adventure with one the players have already 
encountered in your campaign, or add something to 
the background of the adventure so that it involves your 
players' characters in ways that the adventure's designer 
never could have imagined. 
A published adventure can't account for every 
action the characters might take. The nice thing 
about published adventures is that they allow you to 
focus your game preparation time on highlighting plot 
developments in your campaign that the adventure 
can't address. 
Published adventures also provide inspiration. You 
might not use an adventure as written, but it might spur 
ideas, or you can pull out one part of it and repurpose 
that part for your needs. For example, you might use a 
map of a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your 
choice, or you might use a chase sequence as a model 
for a pursuit scene in your campaign. 
ADVENTURE STRUCTURE 
Like every story, a typical adventure has a beginning, a 
middle, and an end. 
BEGINNING 
An adventure starts with a hook to get the players 
interested. A good adventure hook piques the interest 
of the players and provides a compelling reason for 
their characters to become involved in the adventure. 
Maybe the adventurers stumble onto something they're 
not meant to see, monsters attack them on the road, an 
assassin makes an attempt on their lives, or a dragon 
shows up at the city gates. Adventure hooks such as 
these can instantly draw players into your story. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATJNG ADVENTURES 
The beginning of a good adventure should be exciting 
and focused. You want the players to go home looking 
forward to the next session, so give them a clear sense 
of where the story is headed, as well as something to 
look forward to. 
MIDDLE 
The middle of an adventure is where the bulk of the 
story unfolds. With each new challenge, the adventurers 
make important choices that have a clear effect on the 
conclusion of the adventure. 
Over the course of the adventure, the characters might 
discover secrets that reveal new goals or change their 
original goal. Their understanding of what's going on 
around them might change. Maybe rumors of treasure 
were a trick to lure them into a death trap. Perhaps 
the so-called spy in the queen's court is actually a 
scheme concocted by the monarch herself to seize even 
more power. 
At the same time the adventurers are working to 
thwart their adversaries, those adversaries are trying 
to carry out their nefarious plans. Such enemies 
might also work to hide their deeds, mislead potential 
adversaries, or confront problems directly, perhaps by 
trying to kill meddlers. 
Remember that the characters are the heroes of the 
story. Never let them become mere spectators, watching 
as events unfold around them that they can't influence. 
ENDING 
The ending encompasses the climax- the scene or 
encounter in which the tension building throughout the 
adventure reaches its peak. A strong climax should have 
the players on edge, with the fate of the characters and 
much more hanging in the balance. The outcome, which 
hinges on the characters' actions and decisions, should 
never be a forgone conclusion. 
An ending needn't tie everything up in a neat bow. 
Story threads can be left hanging, waiting to be resolved 
in a later adventure. A little bit of unfinished business is 
an easy way to transition from one adventure to the next. 
ADVENTURE TYPES 
An adventure can be location-based or event-based, as 
discussed in the sections that follow. 
LOCATION-BASED ADVENTURES 
Adventures set in crumbling dungeons and remote 
wilderness locations are the cornerstone of countless 
campaigns. Many of the greatest D&D adventures of all 
time are location-based. 
Creating a location-based adventure can be broken 
down into a number of steps. Each step provides tables 
from which you can select the basic elements of your 
adventure. Alternatively, roll on the tables and see how 
the random results inspire you. You can mix up the 
order of the steps. 
1. IDENTIFY THE PARTY'S GOALS 
The Dungeon Goals table provides common goals 
that drive or lure adventurers into dungeons. The
