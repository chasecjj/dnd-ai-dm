This option removes skills from the game and 
doesn't allow for much distinction among characters. 
For example, a character can't choose to emphasize 
persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally 
adept at both. 
BACKGROUND PROFICIENCY 
With this variant rule, characters don't have skill or tool 
proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character 
a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, 
a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any 
ability check to which the character's prior training and 
experience (reflected in the character's background) 
reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of 
whether the character's background applies. 
For example, the player of a character with the noble 
background could reasonably argue that the proficiency 
bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character 
makes to secure an audience with the king. The player 
should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how 
the character's background applies. Not simply "I'm 
a noble," but "I spent three years before starting my 
adventuring career serving as my family's ambassador 
to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature 
to me now." 
This simple system relies heavily on players 
developing their characters' histories. Don't let it 
result in endless debates about whether a character's 
proficiency bonus applies in a given situation. Unless 
a player's attempt to explain the relevance of the 
character's background makes everyone else at the table 
roll their eyes at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the 
player for making the effort. 
If a character has the Expertise feature, instead 
of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of 
that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her 
background to which the benefit applies. Continuing 
the noble example, the player might decide to apply 
Expertise to "situations where courtly manners and 
etiquette are paramount" and "figuring out the secret 
plots that court members hatch against one another." 
PERSONALITY TRAIT PROFICIENCY 
With this variant rule, characters don't have skill 
proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her 
proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to 
the character's positive personality traits. For example, 
a character with a positive personality trait of "I never 
have a plan, but I'm great at making things up as I go 
along" might apply the bonus when engaging in some 
off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player 
should come up with at least four positive personalit)l 
traits when creating a character. 
When a character's negative personality trait directly 
impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage 
on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative 
trait is "I often get lost in my own thoughts and 
contemplation, oblivious to my surroundings" might 
have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice 
creatures sneaking up. 
If a character has the Expertise feature, the player can 
apply its benefit to personality traits related to ability 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would 
gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead 
gains a new positive personality trait. 
This system relies heavily on players developing 
their characters' personalities. Make sure that different 
characters' traits- positive and negative- come into play 
with about the same frequency. Don't let a player get 
away with a positive trait that always seems to apply and 
a negative trait that never does. 
At your discretion, you can also tie a character's 
ideals, bonds, and flaws to this system. 
HERO POINTS 
Hero points work well in epic fantasy and mythic 
campaigns in which the characters are meant to be 
more like superheroes than the average adventurer is. 
With this option, a character starts with 5 hero point 
at 1st level. Each time the character gains a level, he or 
she loses any unspent hero points and gains a new total 
equal to 5 + half the character's level. 
A player can spend a hero point whenever he or she 
makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw 
The player can spend the hero point after the roll is 
made but before any of its results are applied. Spend in_ 
the hero point allows the player to roll a d6 and add it 
to the d20, possibly turning a failure into a success. A 
player can spend only 1 hero point per roll. 
In addition, whenever a character fails a death saving 
throw, the player can spend one hero point to turn the 
failure into a success. 
NEW ABILITY SCORES: 
HONOR AND SANITY 
If you're running a campaign shaped by a strict code of 
honor or the constant risk of insanity, consider adding 
one or both these new ability scores: Honor and Sani _ 
These abilities function like the standard six abilities. 
with exceptions specified in each ability below. 
Here's how to incorporate these optional abilities at 
character creation: 
If your players use the standard array of ability 
scores, add one 11 to the array for each optional 
ability you add. 
If your players use the optional point-buy system, add 
3 points to the number of points for each optional 
ability you add. 
If your players roll their ability scores, have them roll 
for the added ability scores. 
If you ever need to make a check or saving throw for 
Honor or Sanity for a monster that lacks the score, you 
can use Charisma for Honor and Wisdom for Sanity. 
HoNOR ScoRE 
If your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code 
of honor is part of daily life, consider using the Honor 
score as a means of measuring a character's devotion 
to that code. This ability fits well in a setting inspired 
by Asian cultures, such as Kara-Tur in the Forgotten 
Realms. The Honor ability is also useful in any 
campaign that revolves around orders of knights.
