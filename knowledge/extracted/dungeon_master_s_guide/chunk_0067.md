Encounter 
1 displacer beast 
1 gnoll pack lord and 2d4 gnolls 
1d4 gnolls and 2d4 hyenas 
A grove of burned trees. Characters searching 
the area and succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom 
(Survival) check find gnoll tracks. Following the 
tracks for 1 d4 hours leads to an encounter with 
gnolls, or the discovery of dead gnolls with elven 
arrows sticking out of their flea-ridden corpses. 
1 giant owl 
An ivy-covered statue of an elven deity or hero. 
1 dryad (50%) or 1d4 satyrs (50%) 
1 d4 centaurs 
2d4 scouts (elves). One scout carries a horn 
and can use its action to blow it. If the horn is 
blown within the forest, roll on this table again. 
If the result indicates a monster encounter, the 
indicated monster or monsters arrive in 1d4 
minutes. New arrivals other than gnolls, hyenas, 
owl bears, and displacer beasts are friendly 
toward the scouts. 
2d4 pixies (50%) or 2d4 sprites (50%)

RANDOM ENCOUNTER CHALLENGE 
Random encounters need not be level-appropriate 
challenges for the adventurers, but it's considered bad 
form to slaughter a party using a random encounter, 
since most players consider this ending to be an 
unsatisfying one. 
Not all random encounters with monsters need 
to be resolved through combat. A 1st-level party of 
adventurers could have a random encounter with a 
young dragon circling above a forest canopy in search 
of a quick meal, but the characters should have the 
option to hide or bargain for their lives if the dragon 
spots them. Similarly, the party might encounter a stone 
giant roaming the hills, but it might have no intention 
of harming anyone. In fact, it might shy away from the 
party because of its reclusive nature. The giant might 
attack only characters who annoy it. 
That said, a random encounter table usually includes 
hostile (though not necessarily evil) monsters that 
are meant to be fought. The following monsters are 
considered appropriate combat challenges: 
• A single monster with a challenge rating equal to or 
lower than the party's level. 
A group of monsters whose adjusted XP value consti-
tutes an easy, medium, or hard challenge for the party, 
as determined using the encounter-building guide-
lines earlier in this chapter.

Encounter 
1 owlbear 
1d4 elks (75%) or 1 giant elk (25%) 
1d4 blink dogs 
A magical plant with 2d4 glowing berries. A 
creature that ingests a berry becomes invisible 
for 1 hour, or until it attacks or casts a spell. 
Once picked, a berry loses its magic after 
12 hours. Berries regrow at midnight, but if 
all its berries are picked, the plant becomes 
nonmagical and grows no more berries. 
An elven tune carried on a gentle breeze 
1d4 orange (75%) or blue (25%) faerie dragons 
1 druid (elf). The druid is initially indifferent 
toward the party but becomes friendly if the 
characters agree to rid the forest of its gnoll 
infestation. 
1 treant. The treant is friendly if the party 
includes one or more elves or is accompanied by 
a visible fey creature. The treant is hostile if the 
characters are carrying open flames. Otherwise, 
it is indifferent and doesn 't announce its 
presence as the characters pass by.
