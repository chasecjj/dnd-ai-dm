Characters who reach 20th level have attained 
the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Their deeds are 
recorded in the annals of history and recounted by 
bards for centuries. Their ultimate destinies come to 
pass. A cleric might be taken up into the heavens to 
serve as a god's right hand. A warlock could become 
a patron to other warlocks. Perhaps a wizard unlocks 
the secret to immortality (or undeath) and spends eons 
exploring the farthest reaches of the multiverse. A druid 
might become one with the land, transforming into a 
nature spirit of a particular place or an aspect of the 
wild. Other characters could found clans or dynasties 
that revere the memory of their honored ancestors 
from generation to generation, create masterpieces of 
epic literature that are sung and retold for thousands 
of years, or establish guilds or orders that keep the 
adventurers' principles and dreams alive. 
Reaching this point doesn't necessarily dictate the 
end of the campaign. These powerful characters might 
be called on to undertake grand adventures on the 
cosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their 
capabilities can continue to evolve. Characters gain no 
more levels at this point, but they can still advance in 
meaningful ways and continue performing epic deeds 
that resound throughout the multiverse. Chapter 7 
details epic boons you can use as rewards for these 
characters to maintain a sense of progress. 
STARTING AT HIGHER LEVEL -----
Experienced players familiar with the capabilities of 
the character classes and impatient for more significant 
adventures might welcome the idea of starting a 
campaign with characters above 1st level. Creating a 
higher-level character uses the same character creation 
steps outlined in the Player's Handbook. Such a 
character has more hit points, class features, and spells, 
and probably starts with better equipment. 
Starting equipment for characters above 1st level is 
entirely at your discretion, since you give out treasure 
at your own pace. That said, you can use the Starting 
Equipment table as a guide.

FLAVORS OF FANTASY 
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a fantasy game, but that broad 
category encompasses a lot of variety. Many different 
flavors of fantasy exist in fiction and film. Do you want 
a horrific campaign inspired by the works of H. P. 
Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith? Or do you envision a 
world of muscled barbarians and nimble thieves, along 
the lines of the classic sword-and-sorcery books by 
Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber? Your choice can 
have a impact on the flavor of your campaign. 
HEROIC FANTASY 
~~------------------
Heroic fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&D 
rules. The Player's Handbook describes this baseline: 
a multitude of humanoid races coexist with humans in 
fantastic worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to 
bear against the monstrous threats they face. These 
characters typically come from ordinary backgrounds, 
but something impels them into an adventuring life. The 
adventurers are the "heroes" of the campaign, but they 
might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for 
selfish reasons. Technology and society are based on 
medieval norms, though the culture isn't necessarily 
European. Campaigns often revolve around delving into 
ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to 
destroy monsters or villains. 
This genre is also common in fantasy fiction. Most 
novels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as 
heroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the 
authors listed in appendix E of the Player's Handbook. 
SwoRD AND SoRCERY 
A grim, hulking fighter disembowels the high priest 
of the serpent god on his own altar. A laughing rogue 
spends ill-gotten gains on cheap wine in filthy taverns. 
Hardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle in 
search of the fabled City of Golden Masks. 
A sword-and-sorcery campaign emulates some of the 
classic works of fantasy fiction, a tradition that goes 
back to the roots of the game. Here you'll find a dark, 
gritty world of evil sorcerers and decadent cities, where
