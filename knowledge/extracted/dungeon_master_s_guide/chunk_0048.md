O PTIONAL RULE: INTENSE YEARN ING 
-eep track of how many days a visitor spends on 
borea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a 
arisma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for 
ach day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the 
:;eature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to 
- ;borea. As long as the effect persists, the creature has 
~dvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long 
~-r. the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending 
e effect on a success. A dispel evil and good spell 
-~move s this effect from the creature. 
GARD 
:gard is a rugged realm of soaring mountains, deep 
-d . and windswept battlefields, with summers that 
-e long and hot, and winters that are wickedly cold 
-
unforgiving. Its continents float above oceans of 
a nic rock, below which are icy caverns so enormous 
... o hold entire kingdoms of giants, humans, dwarves, 
_- mes, and other beings. Heroes come to Ysgard to 
.:-their mettle not only against the plane itself, but also 
:ainst giants, dragons, and other terrible creatures that 
-:..:nder across Ysgard's vast terrain. 
?TIONAL RULE : IMMORTAL WRATH 
~,ard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal 
- e on fields of glory. Any creature, other than a 
~ ruct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a 
-- · while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next 
_. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all 
·[ions and afflictions it suffered before its death 
bo is a plane of pure chaos, a roiling soup of 
rmanent matter and energy. Stone melts into 
. [hat freezes into metal, then turns into diamond 
that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and 
on and on in an endless, unpredictable process of 
change. Fragments of more ordinary landscapes- bits 
of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling 
streams-drift through the disorder. The whole plane is 
a nightmarish riot. 
Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane 
float in place. A creature can move up to its walking 
speed in any direction by merely thinking of the desired 
direction of travel. 
Limbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting 
it. Very disciplined and powerful minds can create 
whole islands of their own invention within the plane, 
sometimes maintaining those places for years. A 
simpleminded creature such as a fish, though, might 
have less than a minute before the pocket of water 
surrounding it freezes, vanishes, or turns to glass. 
The slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos, 
creating nothing, whereas githzerai monks build entire 
monasteries with their minds. 
OPTIONAL RULE: POWER OF THE MIND 
As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an 
Intelligence check to mentally move an object on 
the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC 
depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for 
Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 
for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature 
moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by 
which it beat the DC. 
A creature can also use an action to make an 
Intelligence check to alter a non magical object that isn't 
being worn or carried. The same rules for distance 
apply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC 
10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and 
DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature 
changes the object into another nonliving form of the 
same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball of fire.
