:. C ONSIDER THE IDEAL CLIMAX 
-:-::e climactic ending of an adventure fulfills the promise 
:all that came before. Although the climax must hinge 
:;:: rhe successes and failures of the characters up to

~::ggestions to help you shape the end of your adventure.

The actions of the adventurers or the villain result 
in a cataclysmic event that the adventurers must 
escape. 
The adventurers race to the site where the villain is 
bringing a master plan to its conclusion, arriving 
just as that plan is about to be completed. 
The villain and two or three lieutenants perform 
separate rites in a large room. The adventurers 
must disrupt all the rites at the same time. 
An ally betrays the adventurers as they're about to 
achieve their goal. (Use this climax carefully, and 
don't overuse it.) 
A portal opens to another plane of existence. 
Creatures on the other side spill out, forcing the 
adventurers to close the portal and deal with the 
villain at the same time. 
Traps, hazards, or animated objects turn against 
the adventurers while the main villain attacks. 
The dungeon begins to collapse while the 
adventurers face the main villain, who attempts to 
escape in the chaos. 
A threat more powerful than the adventurers 
appears, destroys the main villain, and then turns 
its attention on the characters. 
The adventurers must choose whether to pursue 
the fleeing main villain or save an N PC they care 
about or a group of innocents. 
The adventurers must discover the main villain's 
secret weakness before they can hope to defeat that 
villain. 
6. PLAN E NC OUNTERS 
.:..fter you've created the location and the overall story of 
the adventure, it's time to plan out the encounters that 
make up that adventure. In a location-based adventure, 
most encounters are keyed to specific locations on 
a map. For each room or wilderness area on the 
adventure map, your key describes what's in that area: 
its physical features, as well as any encounter that plays 
out there. The adventure key turns a simple sketch 
of numbered areas on graph paper into encounters 
designed to entertain and intrigue your players. 
See "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for 
guidance on crafting individual encounters. 
EVENT-BASED ADVENTURES 
In an event-based adventure, the focus is on what the 
characters and villains do and what happens as a 
result. The question of where those things happen is of 
secondary importance. 
Building an event-based adventure is more work than 
building a location-based one, but the process can be 
simplified by following a number of straightforward 
steps. Several steps include tables from which you 
can choose adventure elements or roll randomly for 
inspiration. As with location-based adventures, you don't 
necessarily have to follow these steps in order. 
1. START WITH A VILLAIN 
Putting care into creating your villain will pay off later, 
since the villain plays such a pivotal role in advancing 
the story. Use the Adventure Villains table in the 
previous section to get started, and use the information 
in chapter 4 to help flesh out the villain. 
For example, your villain might be an undead creature 
seeking to avenge a past imprisonment or injury. An 
interesting aspect of an undead villain is that this past 
injury might have occurred centuries ago, inspiring 
revenge against the descendants of those that harmed 
it. Imagine a vampire imprisoned by the members of a 
religious order of knights, and who now seeks revenge 
against the current members of that order. 
2. DET ERMINE T HE VILLAIN'S ACTIONS 
Once you have a villain, it's time to determine what 
steps the villain takes to achieve its goals. Create a 
timeline showing what the villain does and when, 
assuming no interference from the adventurers. 
Building on the previous example, you might decide 
that your vampire villain murders several knights. By 
slipping past locked doors in gaseous form, the vampire 
is able to make the deaths appear natural at first, but 
it soon becomes clear that a depraved killer is behind 
the murders. 
If you need additional inspiration, consider a few 
different options for how the villain's actions unfold over 
the course of the adventure.

Big Event. The villain's plans come to fruition during 
a festival, an astrological event, a holy (or unholy) rite, a 
royal wedding, the birth of a child, or some similar fixed 
time. The villain's activities up to that point are geared 
toward preparation for this event. 
Crime Spree. The villain commits acts that become 
bolder and more heinous over time. A killer might start 
out by targeting the destitute in the city slums before 
moving up to a massacre in the marketplace, increasing 
the horror and the body count each time.
