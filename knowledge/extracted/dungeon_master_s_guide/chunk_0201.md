NONCOMBAT CHALLE .. GES ------:-
You decide whether to award experience to characters 
for overcoming challenges out ide combat. If the 
adventurers complete a ten e negotiation with a baron, 
forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly dwarves, 
or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom, you might 
decide that they deserve an XP reward. 
As a starting point, use the rules for building combat 
encounters in chapter 3 to gauge the difficulty of the 
challenge. Then award the characters XP as if it had 
been a combat encounter of the same difficulty, but only 
if the encounter involved a meaningful risk of fa ilure. 
MILESTONES 
You can also award XP when characters complete 
significant milestones. When preparing your adventure, 
designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as 
with the following examples: 
Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to 
complete the adventure. 
Discovering a hidden location or piece of information 
relevant to the adventure. 
Reaching an important destination. 
When awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a hard 
encounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter. 
If you want to reward your players for their progress 
through an adventure with something more than XP 
and treasure, give them additional small rewards at 
milestone points. Here are some examples: 
The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest. 
Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level 
spell slot. 
Characters can regain the use of magic items that 
have had their limited uses expended. 
LEVEL ADVANCEMENT WITHOUT XP 
You can do away with experience points entirely and 
control the rate of character advancement. Advance 
characters based on how many sessions they play, or 
when they accomplish significant story goals in the 
campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their 
characters gain a level. 
This method of level advancement can be particularly 
helpful if your campaign doesn't include much 
combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP 
becomes tiresome. 
SESSION-BASED ADVANCEMENT 
A good rate of session-based advancement is to have 
characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, 
3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two 
more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for 
each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard 
rate of advancement, assuming sessions are about four 
hours long. 
STORY-BASED ADVANCEMENT 
When you let the story of the campaign drive 
advancement, you award levels when adventurers 
accomplish significant goals in the campaign.

CHAPTER 9: DuNGEON MASTER's WoRKSHOP 
S THE D UNGEON M ASTER, YOU AREN'T LIMITED 
by the rules in the Player's Handbook, the 
guidelines in this book, or the selection of 
monsters in the Monster Manual. You can 
let your imagination run wild. This chapter 
contains optional rules that you can use to 
customize your campaign, as well as guidelines on 
creating your own material, such as monsters and 
magic items. 
The options in this chapter relate to many different 
parts of the game. Some of them are variants of 
rules, and others are entirely new rules. Each option 
represents a different genre, style of play, or both. 
Consider trying no more than one or two of the options 
at a time so that you can clearly assess their effects on 
your campaign before adding other options. 
Before you add a new rule to your campaign, ask 
yourself two questions: 
• Will the rule improve the game? 
• Will my players like it? 
If you're confident that the answer to both questions is 
yes, then you have nothing to lose by giving it a try. Urge 
your players to provide feedback. If the rule or game 
element isn't functioning as intended or isn't adding 
much to your game, you can refine it or ditch it. No 
matter what a rule's source, a rule serves you, not the 
other way around. 
Beware of adding anything to your game that allows 
a character to concentrate on more than one effect at 
a time, use more than one reaction or bonus action 
per round, or attune to more than three magic items 
at a time. Rules and game elements that override the 
rules for concentration, reactions, bonus actions, and 
magic item attunement can seriously unbalance or 
overcomplicate your game. 
ABILITY OPTIONS 
The optional rules in this section pertain to using 
ability scores. 
PROFICIENCY DICE 
------------------
This optional rule replaces a character's proficiency 
bonus with a proficiency die, adding more randomness 
to the game and making proficiency a less reliable 
indicator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency 
bonus to an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, 
the character's player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die 
table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by 
the character's level. 
Whenever a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise, 
lets a character double his or her proficiency bonus, 
the player rolls the character's proficiency die twice 
instead of once. 
This option is intended for player characters and 
non player characters who have levels, as opposed to 
monsters who don't. 
PROFICIENCY DIE

SKILL VARIANTS 
A skill dictates the circumstances under which a 
character can add his or her proficiency bonus to an 
ability check. Skills define those circumstances by 
referring to different aspects of the six ability scores. 
For example, Acrobatics and Stealth are two different 
aspects of Dexterity, and a character can specialize in 
either or both. 
You can dispense with skills and use one of the 
following variants. Choose whichever one best suits 
your campaign. 
ABILITY CHECK PROFICIENCY 
With this variant rule, characters don't have skill 
proficiencies. Instead, each character has proficiency 
in two abilities: one tied to the character's class and 
one tied to the character's background. The Ability 
Proficiencies by Class table suggests a proficiency for 
each class, and you choose which ability is tied to a 
given background. Starting at 1st level, a character adds 
his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check tied to 
one or the other of these two abilities. 
ABILITY CHECK PROFICIENCIES BY CLASS 
Class 
Ability Check 
Barbarian 
Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom 
Bard 
Any one 
Cleric 
Intelligence, Wisdom , or Charisma 
Druid 
Intelligence or Wisdom 
Fighter 
Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom 
Monk 
Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence 
Paladin 
Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma 
Ranger 
Rogue 
Sorcerer 
Warlock 
Wizard 
Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom 
Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 
Intelligence or Charisma 
Intelligence or Charisma 
Intelligence or Wisdom 
The Expertise feature works differently than normal 
under this rule. At 1st level, instead of choosing two 
skill proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class 
feature chooses one of the abilities in which he or she 
has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two 
of the character's Expertise choices. If the character 
would gain an additional skill proficiency, that character 
instead selects another ability check in which to gain 
proficiency.
