STAFF OF STRIKING 
Staff, very rare (requires attunement) 
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff 
that grants a + 3 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with it. 
The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee 
attack using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. 
For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 
ld6 force damage. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended 
charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, 
roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical 
quarterstaff. 
STAFF OF SWARMING I NSECTS 
Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, 
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard) 
This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended 
charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, 
roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of insects consumes and 
destroys the staff, then disperses. 
Spells. While holding the staff, you can use an 
action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the 
following spells from it, using your spell save DC: giant 
insect (4 charges) or insect plague (5 charges). 
Insect Cloud. While holding the staff, you can use 
an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of 
harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius 
from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making 
the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. 
The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on 
you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the 
swarm and ends the effect. 
STAFF OF THE A DDER 
Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, 
or warlock) 
You can use a bonus action to speak this staff's 
command word and make the head of the staff become 
that of an animate poisonous snake for 1 minute. By 
using another bonus action to speak the command word 
again, you return the staff to its normal inanimate form. 
You can make a melee attack using the snake head, 
which has a reach of 5 feet. Your proficiency bonus 
applies to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 
1d6 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage. 
The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It 
has an Armor Class of 15 and 20 hit points. If the head 
drops to 0 hit points, the staff is destroyed. As long as 
it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost hit points 
when it reverts to its inanimate form. 
STAFF OF THE MAGI 
Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, 
warlock, or wizard) 
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that 
grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell 
attack rolls. 
The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. 
It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If 
you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff 
regains 1d12 + 1 charges. 
Spell Absorption. While holding the staff, you have 
advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, 
you can use your reaction when another creature casts 
a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs 
the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining 
a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. 
However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of 
charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated 
its retributive strike (see below). 
Spells. While holding the staff, you can use an 
action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the 
following spells from it, using your spell save DC and 
spellcasting ability: conjure elemental (7 charges), dispel 
magic (3 charges), fireball (7th-level version, 7 charges), 
flaming sphere (2 charges), ice storm (4 charges), 
invisibility (2 charges), knock (2 charges), lightning bolt 
(7th-level version, 7 charges), passwall (5 charges), plane 
shift (7 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), wall of fire (4 
charges), or web (2 charges). 
You can also use an action to cast one of the following 
spells from the staff without using any charges: arcane 
lock, detect magic, enlarge/reduce, light, mage hand, or 
protection from evil and good. 
Retributive Strike. You can use an action to break 
the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, 
performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed 
and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that 
expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. 
You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to 
a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. 
If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage 
equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff. Every 
other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an 
amount of damage based on how far away it is from the 
point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a 
successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. 
Distance from Origin 
10 ft. away or closer 
11 to 20 ft. away 
21 to 30ft. away 
Damage 
8 x the number of charges in the staff 
6 x the number of charges in the staff 
4 x the number of charges in the staff
