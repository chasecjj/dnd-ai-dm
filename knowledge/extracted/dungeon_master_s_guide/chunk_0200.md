the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the 
adventurers face. 
GOING MAD 
Various magical effects can inflict madness on an 
otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact 
other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can 
use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects 
in the Player's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar 
effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of 
Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts 
can also break the psyche of a character who uses or 
becomes attuned to them. 
Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires 
a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game 
includes the Sanity score (see chapter 9, "Dungeon 
Master's Workshop"), a creature makes a Sanity saving 
throw instead. 
MADNESS EFFECTS 
-----
Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. 
Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term 
madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More 
horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-
term or indefinite madness. 
A character afflicted with short-term madness is 
subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness 
table for ldlO minutes. 
A character afflicted with long-term madness is 
subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness 
table for ldlO x 10 hours. 
A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains 
a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table 
that lasts until cured. 
SHORT-TERM MADNESS 
dlOO 
Effect (lasts ldlO minutes)

LONG-TERM MADNESS 
dlOO 
Effect (lasts ldlO x 10 hours) 
01-10 
The character feels compelled to repeat a specific 
activity over and over, such as washing hands, 
touching things, praying, or counting coins. 
11-20 
The character experiences vivid hallucinations and 
has disadvantage on ability checks. 
21-30 
The character suffers extreme paranoia. The 
character has disadvantage on Wisdom and 
Charisma checks. 
31-40 
The character regards something (usually the 
source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if 
affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/ 
sympathy spell. 
41-45 
The character experiences a powerful delusion. 
Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or 
she is under its effects. 
46-55 
The character becomes attached to a "l ucky 
charm," such as a person or an object, and has 
disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and 
saving throws wh ile more than 30 feet from it. 
56-65 
The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%).

The character experiences uncontrollable tremors 
or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack 
rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve 
Strength or Dexterity. 
76-85 
The character suffers from partial amnesia. The 
character knows who he or she is and retains racial 
traits and class features, but doesn't recognize 
other people or remember anything that happened 
before the madness took effect. 
86-90 
Whenever the character takes damage, he or she 
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw 
or be affected as though he or she failed a saving 
throw against the confusion spell. The confusion 
effect lasts for 1 minute. 
91 -95 
The character loses the ability to speak. 
96-100 The character falls unconscious. No amount of 
jostling or damage can wake the character. 
CURING MADNESS 
A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of 
madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid 
a character of a short-term or long-term madness. 
Depending on the source of the madness, remove 
curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater 
restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to 
rid a character of indefinite madness. 
EXPERIENCE POINTS 
Experience points (XP) fuel level advancement for 
player characters and are most often the reward for 
completing combat encounters. 
Each monster has an XP value based on its 
challenge rating. When adventurers defeat one or more 
monsters-typically by killing, routing, or capturing

them-they divide the total XP value of the monsters 
evenly among themselves. If the party received 
substantial assistance from one or more NPCs, count 
those NPCs as party members when dividing up the 
XP. (Because the NPCs made the fight easier, individual 
characters receive fewer XP.) 
Chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," provides 
guidelines for designing combat encounters using 
experience points. 
ABSENT CHARACTERS 
Typically, adventurers earn experience only for 
encounters they·participate in. If a player is absent 
for a session, the player's character misses out on the 
experience points. 
Over time, you might end up with a level gap between 
the characters of players who never miss a session and 
characters belonging to players who are more sporadic 
in their attendance. Nothing is wrong with that. A gap 
of two or three levels between different characters in 
the same party isn't going to ruin the game for anyone. 
Some DMs treat XP as a reward for participating in 
the game, and keeping up with the rest of the party is 
good incentive for players to attend as many sessions 
as possible. 
As an alternative, give absent characters the same 
XP that the other characters earned each session, 
keeping the group at the same level. Few players 
will intentionally miss out on the fun of gaming just 
because they know they'll receive XP for it even if they 
don't show up.
