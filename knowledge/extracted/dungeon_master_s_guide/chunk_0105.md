Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized 
and dwarf-shaped characters. 
When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your 
discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. 
A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti 
with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots. 
MU LTIPLE ITEMS OF THE SAME KIND 
Use common sense to determine whether more than 
one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A 
character can't normally wear more than one pair of 
footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of 
bracers, one suit of armor, one item of head wear, and 
one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might 
be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or 
be able to layer two cloaks. 
PAIRED I T EMS 
Items that come in pairs- such as boots, bracers, 
gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both 
items of the pair are worn. For example, a character 
wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and 
a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit 
from either item. 
AC TIVAT I NG AN I TEM 
Activating some magic items requires a user to do 
omething special, such as holding the item and uttering 
a command word. The description of each item category 
or individual item details how an item is activated. 
Certain items use one or more of the following rules for 
their activation. 
If an item requires an action to activate, that action 
isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature 
such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to 
activate the item. 
C OMMAND WORD 
A command word is a word or phrase that must be 
poken for an item to work. A magic item that requires 
a command word can't be activated in an area where 
ound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. 
C ONSUMABLES 
Some items are used up when they are activated. A 
potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied 
to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is 
read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. 
MAGIC ITEM FORMULAS 
A magic item formula explains how to make a particular 
magic item. Such a formula can be an excellent reward if you 
allow player characters to craft magic items, as explained in 
chapter 6, "Between Adventures." 
You can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually 
written in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer 
than the item it allows a character to create. For example, 
the formula for a common magic item is uncommon. No 
formulas exist for legendary items. 
If the creation of magic items is commonplace in your 
campaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the 
rarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for 
common and uncommon items might even be for sale, each 
with a cost double that of its magic item. 
SPELLS 
S ome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from 
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell 
level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and 
requires no components, unless the item's description 
says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, 
range, and duration, and the user of the item must 
concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many 
items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell 
and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. 
Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing 
the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. 
A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require 
you to use your own spellcasting ability when you 
cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one 
spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with 
the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability-perhaps 
you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature- your 
spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your 
proficiency bonus does apply. 
CHARGES 
Some magic items have charges that must be expended 
to activate their properties. The number of charges an 
item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell 
is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. 
Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature 
attuned to it learns how many charges it regained. 
MAGIC I T EM R ESILIENCE 
Most magic items are objects of extraordinary 
artisanship. Thanks to a combination of careful crafting 
and magical reinforcement, a magic item is at least as 
durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic 
items, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance 
to all damage. Artifacts are practically indestructible, 
requiring extraordinary measures to destroy. 
SPECIAL FEATURES 
You can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking 
about its backstory. Who made the item? Is anything 
unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and 
how was it originally used? What minor magical quirks 
set it apart from other items of its kind? Answering 
these questions can help turn a generic magic item, 
such as a +llongsword, into a more flavorful discovery. 
The tables that follow can help you come up with 
answers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like. 
Some of the table entries make more sense for certain 
items than for others. Some magic items are made 
only by certain kinds of creatures, for instance; a cloak 
of elvenkind is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If 
you roll something that doesn't make sense, roll again, 
choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail 
as inspiration to make up your own. 
VARIANT: WANDS THAT DoN'T RECHARGE 
A typical wand has expendable charges. If you'd like wands to 
be a limited resource, you can make some of them incapable 
of regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of 
charges in such a wand, to a maximum of25 charges. These 
charges are never regained once they're expended.
