CHAMBER CONTENTS 
Once you have a sense of the purpose of the various 
dungeon chambers, you can think about the contents 
of those areas. The Dungeon Chamber Contents table 
allows you to randomly roll contents for a chamber, or 
you can choose contents for specific areas. If you choose 
contents, be sure to include an interesting, colorful 
assortment of things. In addition to the contents shown 
on this table, refer to "Dungeon Dressing" later in this 
appendix for additional items and elements to fill rooms. 
In the Dungeon Chamber Contents table, a "dominant 
inhabitant" is a creature that controls an area. Pets 
and allied creatures are subservient to the dominant 
inhabitant. "Random creatures" are scavengers or 
nuisances, usually lone monsters or small groups 
passing through the area. They include such creatures 
as carrion crawlers, dire rats, gelatinous cubes, and rust 
monsters. See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for 
more information on random encounters.

MONSTERS AND MOTIVATIONS 
See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for guidance on 
creating encounters with monsters. To foster variety 
and suspense, be sure to include encounters of varying 
difficulty. 
A powerful creature encountered early in the dungeon 
sets an exciting tone and forces the adventurers to 
rely on their wits. For example, an ancient red dragon 
APPENDIX A I RANDOM DUNGEONS 
might slumber on the first level of a dungeon, a pall of 
smoke and the sound of its heavy breathing filling the 
chambers near its lair. Clever characters will do their 
utmost to avoid the dragon, even as the party's brave 
thief makes off with a few coins from its hoard. 
Not all monsters are automatically hostile. When 
placing monsters in your dungeon, consider their 
relationships to nearby creatures and their attitudes 
toward adventurers. Characters might be able to 
appease a hungry beast by offering it food, and smarter 
creatures have complex motivations. The Monster 
Motivation table lets you use a monster's goals to define 
its presence in the dungeon. 
For large groups of monsters encountered across 
multiple chambers, motivation could apply to the entire 
group, or each subgroup could have conflicting goals.

RANDOM DUNGEON HAZARDS 
Hazards are rarely found in inhabited areas, because 
monsters either clear them away or avoid them. 
Shriekers and violet fungi are described in the 
Monster Manual. The other hazards on the table are 
described in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments."

RANDOM OBSTACLES 
Obstacles block progress through the dungeon. In some 
cases, what adventurers consider an obstacle is an 
easy path for the dungeon's inhabitants. For example, 
a flooded chamber is a barrier to many characters but 
easily navigated by water-breathing creatures. 
Obstacles can affect more than one room. A chasm 
might run through several passages and chambers, 
or send cracks through the stonework in a wider area 
around it. An area of battering winds that emanates 
from a magic altar could stir the air less dangerously for 
hundreds of feet in all directions.
