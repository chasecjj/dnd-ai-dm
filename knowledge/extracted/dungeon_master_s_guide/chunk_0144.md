SPELL TURNING 
RING OF 
WATER WALKING 
Ring, legendary (requires attunement) 
While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving 
throws against any spell that targets only you (not in 
an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the 
save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no 
effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the 
slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting 
ability of the caster. 
RING OF SWIMMING 
Ring, uncommon 
You have a swimming speed of 40 feet while wearing 
this ring. 
RING OF TELEKINESIS 
Ring, very rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this ring, you can cast the telekinesis 
spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren't 
being worn or carried. 
RING OF THE RAM 
Ring, rare (requires attunement) 
This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can 
use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to attack 
one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring 
produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll 
with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, 
the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet 
away from you. 
Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's 
charges as an action to try to break an object you can 
see within 60 feet of you that isn't being worn or carried. 
The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for 
each charge you spend. 
RING OF THREE WISHES 
Ring, legendary 
While wearing this ring, you can use an action to 
expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the wish spell from

last charge. 
RING OF WARMTH

damage. In addition, you and everything you wear and 
carry are unharmed by temperatures as low as - 50 
degrees Fahrenheit. 
RING OF WATER WALKING 
Ring, uncommon 
While wearing this ring, you can stand on and move 
across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground. 
RING OF X-RAY VISION 
Ring, rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak 
its command word. When you do so, you can see into 
and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a 
radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius 
appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing 
through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 
1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. 
Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin 
sheet of lead. 
Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long 
rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw or gain one level of exhaustion. 
ROBE OF EYES 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you 
wear the robe, you gain the following benefits: 
The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have

rely on sight. 
• You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. 
• You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as 
see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.
