FORCES AND PHILOSOPHIES 
Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities. 
In some campaigns, believers hold enough conviction 
in their ideas about the universe that they gain magical ·, · 
power from that conviction. In other campaigns, 
' 
impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods 
by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as 
druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the 
force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity, 
some clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to 
a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and 
chivalry rather than a specific deity. 
Forces and philosophies aren't worshiped; they aren't 
beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept 
sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't 
necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can 
be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship 
to various good deities, or revere the force of nature 
and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might 
be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal 
force. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable 
power (through their clerics), it's unusual for a 
philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a 
common philosophical belief states that the deities are 
more like mortals than they would have mortals believe. 
According to such philosophies, the gods aren't truly 
immortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain 
divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate 
goal of some philosophies. 
. 
The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that 
mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person 
believes in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power 
on that person. 
HUMANOIDS AND THE GODS 
When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider 
range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In 
many D&D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and 
other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected 
that an ore will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of 
subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces 
a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture 
might have its own array of gods. 
In most D&D settings, there is no single god that 
can claim to have created humanity. Thus, the human 
proclivity for building institutions extends to religion. 
A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire 
kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that 
prophet's death, the religion might wax or wane, or the 
prophet's followers might turn against one another and 
found several competing religions. 
In comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in 
stone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify 
Moradin as their creator. While individual dwarves 
might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are 
pledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His 
teachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in 
dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to 
replace him. 
With that in mind, consider the role of the gods in 
your world and their ties to different humanoid races. 
· Does each race have a creator god? How does that god 
• 
shape that race's culture? Are other folk free of such 
divine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race 
turned against the god that created it? Has a new race 
appeared, created by a god within the past few years? 
A deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble 
line, or other cultural institution. With the death of 
the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine 
portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in 
its earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other 
gods might be outlawed or tightly controlled. 
Finally, consider the difference between gods who 
are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with 
more diverse followers. Do the races with their own 
pantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with 
their gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the 
other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the 
deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor 
of one god or another?
