bonuses and abilities and paying attention 
to the game and immersing themselves in 
its world. 
Remember that dice don't run your 
game- you do. Dice are like rules. They're 
tools to help keep the action moving. At any 
time, you can decide that a player's action is 
automatically successful. You can also grant 
the player advantage on any ability check, 
reducing the chance of a bad die roll foiling the 
character's plans. By the same token, a bad plan 
or unfortunate circumstances can transform the 
easiest task into an impossibility, or at least impose 
disadvantage. 
USING ABILITY SCORES 
When a player wants to do something, it's often 
appropriate to let the attempt succeed without a roll 
or a reference to the character's ability scores. For 
example, a character doesn't normally need to make 
a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a 
Charisma check to order a mug of ale. Only call for a 
roll if there is a meaningful consequence for failure. 
When deciding whether to use a roll, ask yourself two 
questions: 
Is a task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that 
there should be no chance of failure? 
Is a task so inappropriate or impossible- such as 
hitting the moon with an arrow-that it can't work? 
If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind 
of roll is appropriate. The following sections provide 
guidance on determining whether to call for an ability 
check, attack roll, or saving throw; how to assign DCs; 
when to use advantage and disadvantage; and other 
related topics. 
ABILITY CHECKS 
An ability check is a test to see whether a character 
succeeds at a task that he or she has decided to attempt. 
The Player's Handbook includes examples of what 
each ability score is used for. The Ability Checks table 
summarizes that material for easy reference. 
MULTIPLE ABILITY CHECKS 
Sometimes a character fails an ability check and 
wants to try again. In some cases, a character is free 
to do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With 
enough attempts and enough time, a character should

eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, 
assume that a character spending ten times the normal 
amount of time needed to complete a task automatically 
succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating 
the check allows a character to turn an impossible task 
into a successful one. 
In other cases, failing an ability check makes it 
impossible to make the same check to do the same thing 
again. For example, a rogue might try to trick a town 
guard into thinking the adventurers are undercover 
agents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of 
Charisma (Deception) against the guard's Wisdom 
(Insight), the same lie told again won't work. The 
characters can come up with a different way to get past 
the guard or try the check again against another guard 
at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial 
failure makes those checks more difficult to pull off.
