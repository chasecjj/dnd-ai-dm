TALISMAN 
OF THE SPHERE 
drop to 0 hit points or it does, or until you can't reach 
the creature to make a melee attack against it. 
You can break the curse in the usual ways. 
Alternatively, casting banishment on the sword forces 
the vengeful spirit to leave it. The sword then becomes a 
+1 weapon with no other properties. 
SwoRD OF WouNDING 
Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement) 
Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained 
only through a short or long rest, rather than by 
regeneration, magic, or any other means. 
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack 
using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. 
At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, 
it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've 
wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on 
itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, 
or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to 
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the 
effect of such wounds on it on a success. 
TALISMAN OF PuRE Goon 
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a 
creature of good alignment) 
This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A 
creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 
6d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. An 
evil creature takes 8d6 radiant damage upon touching 
the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage 
again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying 
the talisman. 
If you are a good cleric or paladin, you can use the 
talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to 
pel! attack rolls while you wear or hold it. 
The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or 
holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge 
from it and choose one creature you can see on the 
ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil 
TALISMAN OF 
ULTIMATE EviL 
alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target 
must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall 
into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. 
The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. 
When you expend the last charge, the talisman 
disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed. 
TALISMAN OF THE SPHERE 
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) 
When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to 
control a sphere of annihilation while you are holding 
this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the 
check. In addition, when you start your turn with control 
over a sphere of annihilation, you can use an action to 
levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal 
to 10 x your Intelligence modifier. 
TALISMAN OF ULTIMATE EVIL 
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a 
creature of evil alignment) 
This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that 
is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 necrotic 
damage upon touching the talisman. A good creature 
takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. 
Either sort of creature takes the damage again each 
time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman. 
If you are an evil cleric or paladin, you can use the 
talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to 
spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it. 
The talisman has 6 charges. If you are wearing or 
holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge 
from the talisman and choose one creature you can 
see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target 
is of good alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. 
The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving 
throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving 
no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace 
of its existence. When you expend the last charge, 
the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is 
destroyed.
