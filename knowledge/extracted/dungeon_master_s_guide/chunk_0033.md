Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis, but you 
can create or adapt whatever model works best for the 
planes you want to use in your game. 
THE GREAT WHEEL 
The default cosmological arrangement presented 
in the Player's Handbook visualizes the planes as a 
group of concentric wheels, with the Material Plane 
and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form 
a wheel around the Material Plane, enveloped in the 
Ethereal Plane. Then the Outer Planes form another 
wheel around and behind (or above or below) that one, 
arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands 
linking them all. 
This arrangement makes sense of the way the River 
Styx flows among the Lower Planes, connecting 
Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the 
Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it's 
not the only possible explanation of the river's course. 
THE WORLD TREE 
A different arrangement of planes envisions them 
situated among the roots and branches of a great cosmic 
tree, literally or figuratively. 
For example, the Norse cosmology centers on the 
World Tree Yggdrasil. The three roots of the World 
Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer Plane 
that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other 
regions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim 
(the underworld). The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, 
is a unique transitive plane that connects Asgard 
and Midgard. 
Similarly, one vision of the planes where the deities 
of the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of 
celestial planes in the branches of a World Tree, while 
the fiendish planes are linked by a River of Blood. 
Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these 
planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, 
though they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish 
creatures. 
THE WORLD AxiS 
In this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its 
echoes stand between two opposing realms. The Astral 
Plane (or Astral Sea) floats above them, holding any 
number of divine domains (the Outer Planes). Below 
the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single, 
undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements 
clash together. At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is 
the Abyss, like a hole torn in the fabric of the cosmos. 
OTHER VISIONS 
As you build your own cosmology, consider the 
following alternatives. 
The Omniverse. This simple cosmology covers the 
bare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes; 
a single Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven, where good-
aligned deities and celestials live; and the Underworld, 
where evil deities and fiends live. 
Myriad Planes. In this cosmology, countless planes 
clump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each 
other more or less at random. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A Mt.:LTI\ ERSE 
The Orrery. All the Inner and Outer Planes orbit the 
Material Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on 
the world as they come nearer and farther. The world of 
Eberron uses this cosmological model. 
The Winding Road. In this cosmology, every plane is 
a stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to 
two others, but there's no necessary cohesion between 
adjacent planes; a traveler can walk from the slopes of 
Mount Celestia onto the slopes of Gehenna. 
Mount Olympus. In the Greek cosmology, Mount 
Olympus stands at the center of the world (the Material 
Plane), with its peak so high that it's actually another 
plane of existence: Olympus, the home of the gods. All 
the Greek gods except Hades have their own domains 
within Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal 
souls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually 
fade into nothing. Tartarus, where the titans are 
imprisoned in endless darkness, lies below Hades. And 
far to the west of the known world in the Material Plane 
are the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes 
reside there. 
Solar Barge. The Egyptian cosmology is defined by 
the daily path of the sun- across the sky of the Material 
Plane, down to the fair Offering Fields in the west, 
where the souls of the righteous live in eternal reward, 
and then beneath the world through the nightmarish 
Twelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer 
Plane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral 
Plane and the other Outer Planes in the different stages 
of its journey. 
One World. In this model, there are no other 
planes of existence, but the Material Plane includes 
places like the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount 
Celestia, the strange city of Mechanus, the fortress of 
Acheron, and so on. All the planes are locations in the 
wodd, reachable by ordinary means of travel-though 
extraordinary effort is required, for example, to sail 
across the sea to the blessed isles of Elysium. 
The Otherworld. In this model, the Material Plane 
has a twin realm that fills the role of all the other planes. 
Much like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane 
and can be reached through "thin places" where the 
worlds are particularly close: through caves, by sailing 
far across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote forests. It 
has dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods), 
sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the 
blessed death), and realms of elemental fury. This 
otherworld is sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or 
by four cities that each represent a different aspect of 
reality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld, called 
Tfr na n6g, and the cosmologies of some religions 
inspired by Asian myth have a similar Spirit World. 
PLANAR TRAVEL 
When adventurers travel to other planes of existence, 
they undertake a legendary journey that might force 
them to face supernatural guardians and undergo 
various ordeals. The nature of that journey and the trials 
along the way depend in part on the means of travel, and 
whether the adventurers find a magic portal or use a 
spell to carry them.
