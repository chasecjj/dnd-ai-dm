Soul Hunter. While you hold the weapon. you are 
aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 
60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also 
can't be charmed or frightened. 
Blackrazor can cast the haste spell on you once per 
day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains 
concentration on it so that you don't have to. 
Sentience. Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral 
weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and 
a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 
The weapon can speak, read, and understand 
Common, and can communicate with its wielder 
telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you 
are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every 
language you know. 
Personality. Blackrazor speaks with an imperious 
tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. 
The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't 
care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The 
word believes that all matter and energy sprang from 
a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. 
Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along. 
Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange 
kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked 
away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three 
weapons to be united again and wielded together in 
combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm 
and finds Wave tedious. 
Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If 
the sword goes three days or more without consuming 
a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the 
next sunset. 
M OONBLADE 
Weapon (longs word), legendary (requires attunement by 
an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment) 
Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the 
most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In 
ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one 
uch blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded 
from the world, their magic lost as family lines have 
become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their 
bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these 
weapons remain. 
A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The 
sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that 
person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can 
claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies 
dormant. It functions like a normallongsword until a 
worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power. 
Amoonblade serves only one master at a time. The 
attunement process requires a special ritual in the 
throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated 
to the elven gods. 
A moon blade won't serve anyone it regards as 
craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and 
protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make 
ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with 
disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you 
become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the 
blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or 
the weapon is destroyed. 
A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each 
master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune 
always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the 
first grants the moon blade an additional property. The 
DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on 
the Moon Blade P roperties table. 
MOONBLADE PROPERTIES

95-96 
You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade 
to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and 
is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 
on itself on a success. This property can't be used 
again until you take a short rest while attuned to 
the weapon .

You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, 
provided that you don't already have one serving

space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics 
for a shadow from the Monster Manual, except it 
is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, 
and doesn't create new shadows. You control 
this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It 
remai ns until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss 
it as an action .

The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword. 
Sentience. A moon blade is a sentient neutral good 
weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and 
a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 
The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, 
sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand
