trains carry travelers from one great city to another. 
Gods Inhabit the Land, or Are Entirely Absent. 
What if the gods regularly walk the earth? What if the 
characters can challenge them and seize their power? 
Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never 
make contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the 
gods are extremely distant-perhaps nonexistent-and 
clerics rely instead on elemental power for their magic. 
Gons OF YouR WoRLD 
Appendix B of the Player's Handbook presents a 
number of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not 
united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for use in your 
game, including the gods of established D&D worlds 
and fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of 
these pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose 
deities and ideas from them as you please. See "A 
Sample Pantheon" in this section for an example. 
As far as the game's rules are concerned, it doesn't 
matter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church 
devoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose 
domains, not deities, so your world can associate 
domains with deities in any way you choose. 
LOOSE PANTHEONS 
Most D&D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. 
A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of 
existence, variously cooperating with and competing 
against one another to administer the affairs of the 
universe. People gather in public shrines to worship 
gods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to 
venerate gods of deception or destruction. 
Each deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is 
responsible for advancing that portfolio. In the 
Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor who

CHAPTER I I A WORLD Of YOUR OWN 
calls clerics and paladins to his service and encourages 
them to spread the ideals of honorable warfare, 
chivalry, and justice in society. Even in the midst of his 
everlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and 
tyranny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war 
fought nobly and in the cause of justice. 
People in most D&D worlds are polytheistic, honoring 
deities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of 
other cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods, 
regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a 
person might propitiate Umberlee before setting out 
to sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at 
harvest time, and pray to Malar before going hunting. 
Some individuals feel a calling to a particular deity's 
service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly 
devoted individuals become priests by setting up a 
shrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely, 
those who feel such a calling become clerics or paladins 
invested with the responsibility of true divine power. 
Shrines and temples serve as community gathering 
points for religious rites and festivals. Priests at such 
sites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their 
patron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform 
religious rites, and provide training in activities their 
deities favor. Cities and large towns can host several 
temples dedicated to individual gods important to the 
community, while smaller settlements might have a 
single shrine devoted to any gods the locals revere. 
To quickly build a pantheon for your world, crea~e 
a single god for each of the eight domains available 
to clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, 
Tempest, Trickery, and War. You can invent names 
and personalities for these deities, or borrow deities 
from other pantheons. This approach gives you a small 
pantheon that covers the most significant aspects of 
existence, and it's easy enough to extrapolate other 
areas of life each deity controls. The god of Knowledge,
