The Monster Features table list \·arious features that 
you can plunder from the Monster j\tfanual. The table 
notes which features increase a monster's effective 
Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus. or damage output 
for the purpose of determining its challenge rating. (The 
features don't actually change the monster's statistics-) 
Features that have no effect on a monster's challenge 
rating are noted with a dash (-)-
When assigning special traits, actions, or reactions 
to a monster, keep in mind that not all monsters need 
them. The more you add, the more complex (and harder 
to run) the monster becomes. 
Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting. The impact 
that the Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting special 
traits have on a monster's challenge rating depends 
on the spells that the monster can cast Spells that 
deal more damage than the monster's normal attack 
routine and spells that increase the monster's AC or 
hit points need to be accounted for when determining 
the monster's final challenge rating. See the "Special 
Traits" section in the introduction of the Monster 
Manual for more information on these two special traits. 
STEP 14. SPEED 
Every monster has a walking speed. (Immobile 
monsters have a walking speed of 0 feet) In addition to 
its walking speed, a monster might have one or more 
other speeds, including a burrowing, climbing, flying, or 
swimming speed. 
Flying Monster. Increase the monster's effective 
Armor Class by 2 (not its actual A C) if it can fly and deal 
damage at range and if its expected challenge rating 
is 10 or lower (higher-level characters have a greater 
ability to deal with flying creatures). 
STEP 15. SAVING THROW BONUSES 
If you want a monster to be unusually resistant to 
certain kinds of effects, you can give it a bonus to saving 
throws tied to a particular ability. 
A saving throw bonus is best used to counteract a low 
ability score. For example, an undead monster with a 
low Wisdom score might need a Wisdom saving throw 
bonus to account for the fact that it's more difficult to 
charm, frighten, or turn than its Wisdom would indicate. 
A saving throw bonus is equal to the monster's 
proficiency bonus+ the monster's relevant 
ability modifier. 
A monster with three or more saving throw bonuses 
has a significant defensive advantage, so its effective AC 
(not its actual AC) should be raised when determining 
its challenge rating. If it has three or four bonuses, 
increase its effective AC by 2. If it has five or more 
bonuses, increase its effective AC by 4. 
STEP 16. FINAL CHALLENGE RATING 
At this point, you have all the statistical information 
you need to calculate the monster's final challenge 
rating. This step is identical to step 4 under "Creating 
Quick Monster Stats." Calculate the monster's defensive 
challenge rating and its offensive challenge rating, then 
take the average to get its final challenge rating. 
STEP 17. SKILL BONUSES 
If you want a monster to be proficient in a skill, you can 
give it a bonus equal to its proficiency bonus on ability 
checks related to that skill. For example, a monster 
with sharp senses might have a bonus on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks, while a duplicitous monster might 
have a bonus on Charisma (Deception) checks. 
You can double the proficiency bonus to account for 
heightened mastery. For example, a doppelganger is 
so good at deceiving others that its bonus on Charisma 
(Deception) checks is equal to double its proficiency 
bonus + its Charisma modifier. 
Skill bonuses have no bearing on a monster's 
challenge rating. 
STEP 18. CONDITION IMMUNITIES 
A monster can be immune to one or more debilitating 
conditions, and these immunities have no bearing on 
its challenge rating. For descriptions of the various 
conditions, see appendix A of the Player's Handbook. 
As with damage immunities, condition immunities 
should be intuitive and logical. For example, it makes 
sense that a stone golem can't be poisoned, since it's a 
construct without a nervous system or internal organs. 
STEP 19. SENSES 
A monster might have one or more of the following 
special senses, which are described in the Monster 
Manual: blindsight, darkvision, tremorsense, and 
truesight. Whether the monster has special senses or 
not has no bearing on its challenge rating. 
Passive Perception Score. All monsters have a 
passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which is most 
often used to determine whether a monster detects 
approaching or hidden enemies. A monster's passive 
Wisdom (Perception) score is 10 + its Wisdom modifier. 
If the monster has proficiency in the Perception skill, its 
score is 10 +its Wisdom (Perception) bonus. 
STEP 20. LANGUAGES 
Whether a monster can speak a language has no 
bearing on its challenge rating. 
A monster can master as many spoken languages as 
you want, although few monsters know more than one 
or two, and many monsters (beasts in particular) have 
no spoken language whatsoever. A monster that lacks 
the ability to speak might still understand a language. 
Telepathy. Whether or not a monster has telepathy 
has no bearing on its challenge rating. For more 
information on telepathy, see the Monster Manual. 
NPC STAT BLOCKS 
----------------
Appendix B of the Monster Manual contains stat blocks 
for common NPC archetypes such as bandits and 
guards, as well as tips for customizing them. Those tips 
include adding racial traits from the Player's Handbook, 
equipping NPCs with magic items, and swapping armor, 
weapons, and spells.
