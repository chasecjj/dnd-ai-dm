launch a lightning bolt (100-foot line) at some ogres 
and hobgoblins, and you could use the table to say 
four of the monsters are targeted (100 + 30 = 3.33, 
rounded up to 4). 
This approach aims at simplicity instead of spatial 
precision. If you prefer more tactical nuance, consider 
using miniatures. 
HANDLING MOBS 
Keeping combat moving along at a brisk pace can be 
difficult when there are dozens of monsters involved 
in a battle. When handling a crowded battlefield, you 
can speed up play by forgoing attack rolls in favor of 
approximating the average number of hits a large group 
of monsters can inflict on a target. 
Instead of rolling an attack roll, determine the 
minimum d20 roll a creature needs in order to hit a 
target by subtracting its attack bonus from the target's 
AC. You'll need to refer to the result throughout the 
battle, so it's best to write it down. 
Look up the minimum d20 roll needed on the Mob 
Attacks table. The table shows you how many creatures 
that need that die roll or higher must attack a target 
in order for one of them to hit. If that many creatures 
attack the target, their combined efforts result in one of 
them hitting the target. 
For example, eight orcs surround a fighter. The orcs' 
attack bonus is +5, and the fighter's AC is 19. The orcs 
need a 14 or higher to hit the fighter. According to the 
table, for every three orcs that attack the fighter, one 
of them hits. There are enough orcs for two groups of 
three. The remaining two orcs fail to hit the fighter. 
If the attacking creatures deal different amounts 
of damage, assume that the creature that deals the 
most damage is the one that hits. If the creature that 
hits has multiple attacks with the same attack bonus, 
assume that it hits once with each of those attacks. If a 
creature's attacks have different attack bonuses, resolve 
each attack separately. 
This attack resolution system ignores critical hits in 
favor of reducing the number of die rolls. As the number 
of combatants dwindles, switch back to using individual 
die rolls to avoid situations where one side can't possibly 
hit the other.

USING MINIATURES 
In combat, players can often rely on your description 
to visualize where their characters are in relation to 
their surroundings and their enemies. Some complex 
battles, however, are easier to run with visual aids, the 
most common of which are miniatures and a grid. If y 
like to construct model terrain, build three-dimension 
dungeons, or draw maps on large vinyl mats, you sho -
also consider using miniatures. 
The Player's Handbook offers simple rules for 
depicting combat using miniature figures on a grid. T'- -
section expands on that material. 
TACTICAL MAPS 
You can draw tactical maps with colored markers on a 
wet-erase vinyl mat with l-inch squares, on a large sh -
of paper, or on a similar flat surface. Preprinted poster-
sized maps, maps assembled from cardboard tiles, anc. 
terrain made of sculpted plaster or resin are also fun. 
The most common unit for tactical maps is the 5-foo:: 
square, and maps with grids are readily available and 
easy to create. However, you don't have to use a grid a 
all. You can track distances with a tape measure, string 
craft sticks, or pipe cleaners cut to specific lengths. 
Another option is a play surface covered by l-inch 
hexagons (often called hexes), which combines the eas_ 
counting of a grid with the more flexible movement of 
using no grid. Dungeon corridors with straight walls 
and right angles don't map easily onto hexes, though.
