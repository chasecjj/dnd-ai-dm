CLOAK OF 
DISPLACEMENT 
CLOAK OF ELVENKIND 
CENSER OF CONTROLLING AIR ELEMENTALS 
Wondrous item, rare 
While incense is burning in this censer, you can use 
an action to speak the censer's command word and 
summon an air elemental, as if you had cast the conjure 
elemental spell. The censer can't be used this way again 
until the next dawn. 
This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a 
chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound. 
CHIME OF OPENING 
Wondrous item, rare 
This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and 
:-veighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action, pointing 
1t at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, 
such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime issues a clear 
tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless 
the sound can't reach the object. If no locks or latches 
remain, the object itself opens. 
The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time 
it cracks and becomes useless. 
' 
CIRCLET OF BLASTING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to 
cast the scorching ray spell with it. When you make the 
spell's attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of +5'. The 
circlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn. 
CLOAK OF ARACHNIDA 
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) 
This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with 
faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the 
following benefits: 
You have resistance to poison damage. 
You have a climbing speed equal to your 
walking speed. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces 
and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your 
hands free. 
• You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move 
through webs as if they were difficult terrain. 
• You can use an action to cast the web spell (save DC 
13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal 
area. Once used, this property of the cloak can't be 
used again until the next dawn. 
CLOAK OF DISPLACEMENT 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that 
makes you appear to be standing in a place near 
your actual location, causing any creature to have 
disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take 
damage, the property ceases to function until the 
start of your next turn. This property is suppressed 
while you are in-capacitated, restrained, or otherwise 
unable to move. 
CLOAK OF ELVENKIND 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom 
(Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage. 
and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks 
made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage 
you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action. 
CLOAK OF INVISIBILITY 
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) 
While wearing this cloak, you can pull its hood over 
your head to cause yourself to become invisible. While 
you are invisible, anything you are carrying or wearing 
is invisible with you. You become visible when you cease 
wearing the hood. Pulling the hood up or down requires 
an action.
