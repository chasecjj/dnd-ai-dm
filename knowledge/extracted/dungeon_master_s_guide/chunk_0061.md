COMPLICATIONS 
Sometimes an adventure isn't as straightforward as it 
might seem. 
MORAL QUANDARIES 
If you want to give the characters a crisis that no amount 
of spellcasting or swordplay can resolve, add a moral 
quandary to the adventure. A moral quandary is a 
problem of conscience for which the adventurers must 
make a single choice-but never a simple one.

Ally Quandary. The adventurers have a better chance 
of achieving their goal with the help of two individuals 
whose expertise is all but essential. However, these 
two NPCs hate each other and refuse to work together 
even if the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The 
adventurers must choose the NPC that is most likely to 
help them accomplish their goal. 
Friend Quandary. An NPC that one or more of the 
characters cares about makes an impossible demand 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES 
on the characters. A love interest might demand that 
a character turn away from a dangerous quest. A 
dear friend might plead with the characters to spare 
the villain's life, to prove that they are better than the 
villain. A weak NPC might beg for a chance to win favor 
from the characters by undertaking a dangerous but 
essential mission. 
Honor Quandary. A character is forced to choose 
between victory and a personal oath or code of honor. 
A paladin who has sworn the Oath of Virtue might 
realize that the clearest path to success lies in deceit 
and subterfuge. A Joyal cleric might be tempted to 
disobey the orders of his or her faith. If you present 
this quandary, be sure to provide an opportunity for a 
character to atone for violating his or her oath. 
Rescue Quandary. The adventurers must choose 
between catching or hurting the villain and saving 
innocent lives. For example, the adventurers might 
learn that the villain is camped nearby, but they also 
learn that another part of the villain's forces is about 
to march into a village and burn it to the ground. The 
characters must choose between taking out the villain 
or protecting innocent villagers, some of whom might be 
friends or family members. 
Respect Quandary. Two important allies give 
conflicting directions or advice to the adventurers. 
Perhaps the high priest counsels the characters to 
negotiate peace with militaristic elves in the nearby 
forest, while a veteran warrior urges them to prove their 
strength with a decisive first strike. The adventurers 
can't follow both courses, and whichever ally they 
choose, the other loses respect for them and might no 
longer aid them. 
TWISTS 
A twist can complicate a story and make it harder for 
the characters to complete their goals. 
TWISTS

5

6 
Completing an adventure goal fulfills a prophecy or

prevents the fulfillment of a prophecy. 
The adventurers have two different goals, but they 
can complete only one. 
Completing the goal secretly helps the villain. 
The adventurers must cooperate with a known 
enemy to achieve the goal. 
The adventurers are under magical compulsion 
(such as a geas spell) to complete their goal.
