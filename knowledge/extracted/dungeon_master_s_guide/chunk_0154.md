T"~s 
Lightning. When you hit with a melee attack using 
the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 
lightning damage. 
Thunder. When you hit with a melee attack using the 
staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder, 
audible out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed 
on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become 
stunned until the end of your next turn. 
Lightning Strike. You can use an action to cause a 
bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line that 
is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that 
line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
Thunderclap. You can use an action to cause the staff 
to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 
feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including 
you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On 
a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and 
becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a 
creature takes half damage and isn't deafened. 
Thunder and Lightning. You can use an action to 
use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at 
the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of 
those properties, only the use of this one. 
STAFF OF WITHERING 
Staff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or 
warlock) 
This staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. 
The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On 
a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you 
can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 2d10 necrotic 
damage to the target. In addition, the target must 
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have 
disadvantage for 1 hour on any ability check or saving 
throw that uses Strength or Constitution. 
STONE OF CONTROLLING EARTH ELEMENTALS 
Wondrous item, rare 
If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an 
action to speak its command word and summon an 
earth elemental, as if you had cast the conjure elemental 
spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the 
next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds. 
STONE OF GOOD LUCK (LUCKSTONE) 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
While this polished agate is on your person, you gain a 
+ 1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws. 
SuN BLADE 
Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement) 
This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While 
grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a 
blade of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make 
the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic 
longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient 
with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with 
the sun blade.
