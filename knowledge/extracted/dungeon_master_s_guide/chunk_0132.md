INSTRUMENT OF THE B A RDS 
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a 
bard) 
An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of it 
kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. 
Seven types of these instruments exist, each named 
after a legendary bard college. The following table lists 
the spells common to all instruments, as well as the 
spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that 
attempts to play the instrument without being attuned 
to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
take 2d4 psychic damage. 
You can use an action to play the instrument and cast 
one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to 
cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until 
the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability 
and spell save DC. 
When you use the instrument to cast a spell that 
causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the 
targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This 
effect applies whether you are using the instrument as 
the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.

lOUN S T ONE 
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement) 
An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge 
and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of 
Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of 
shape and color. 
When you use an action to toss one of these stones 
into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance 
of ld3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, 
another creature must use an action to grasp or net 
the stone to separate it from you, either by making a 
successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 
24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action 
to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all 
damage. It is considered to be an object that is being 
worn while it orbits your head. 
Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender 
ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to 
cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you 
can see and targeting only you. 
Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it 
burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you 
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the 
number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't 
cancel it. 
Agility(Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 
2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits 
your head. 
Awareness (Rare). You can't be surprised while this 
dark blue rhomboid orbits your head. 
Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score 
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink 
rhomboid orbits your head. 
Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled 
lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can 
use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower 
cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. 
Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it 
burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you 
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the 
number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't 
cancel it. 
Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom score increases 
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue 
sphere orbits your head. 
Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence score 
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled 
scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head. 
Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma score 
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled 
pink and green sphere orbits your head. 
Mastery (Legendary). Your proficiency bonus 
increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits 
your head. 
Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC while 
this dusty rose prism orbits your head. 
Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 hit points 
at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits 
your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. 
Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores 
spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The 
stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. 
When found, it contains ld4 - 1 levels of stored spells 
chosen by the DM. 
Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level 
into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The 
spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. 
If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended 
without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell 
determines how much space it uses. 
While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any 
spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save 
DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the 
original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the 
louN STONES 
IRON BANDS OF BILARRO 
spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in 
it, freeing up space. 
Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength score increases 
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid 
orbits your head. 
Sustenance (Rare). You don't need to eat or drink 
while this clear spindle orbits your head. 
IRON BANDS OF BILARRO 
Wondrous item, rare 
This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter 
and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak 
the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or 
smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As 
the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle 
of metal bands. 
Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal 
to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. 
On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus 
action to speak the command word again to release it. 
Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands 
to contract and become a sphere once more. 
A creature, including the one restrained, can use an 
action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the 
iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and 
the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any 
further attempts made by that creature automatically 
fail until 24 hours have elapsed. 
Once the bands are used, they can't be used again 
until the next dawn.
