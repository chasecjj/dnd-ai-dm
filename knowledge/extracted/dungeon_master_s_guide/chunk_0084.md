RANDOM BUILDINGS 
Pulse-pounding chases and harrowing escapes within 
the confines of a town or city can sometimes force 
characters to dash into buildings. When you need to 
flesh out a building quickly, roll on the Building Type 
table. Then roll on the table corresponding to that 
building to add further detail. 
If a roll makes no sense considering where the 
characters are (such as a lavish mansion in a rundown 
part of town), you can always roll again or simply choose 
another result. However, such unexpected results can 
prompt creativity and memorable locations that help 
make your urban encounters distinct.

MAPPING A SETTLEMENT 
When you draw a map for a settlement in your game, 
don't worry about the placement of every building, and 
concentrate instead on the major features. 
For a village, sketch out the roads, including trade 
routes leading beyond the village and roads that connect 
outlying farms to the village center. Note the location of 
the village center. If the adventurers visit specific places 
in the village, mark those spots on your map. 
For towns and cities, note major roads and waterways 
as well as surrounding terrain. Outline the walls 
and mark the locations of features you know will be 
important: the lord's keep, significant temples, and 
the like. For cities, add internal walls and think about 
the personality of each ward. Give the wards names 
reflecting their personalities, which also identify 
the kinds of trades that dominate the neighborhood 
(Tannery Square, Temple Row), a geographical 
characteristic (Hilltop, Riverside), or a dominant site 
(the Lords' Quarter). 
URBAN ENCOUNTERS 
Although they hold the promise of safety, cities and 
towns can be just as dangerous as the darkest dungeon. 
Evil hides in plain sight or in dark corners. Sewers, 
shadowy alleys, slums, smoke-filled taverns, dilapidated 
tenements, and crowded marketplaces can quickly turn 
into battlegrounds. On top of that, adventurers must 
learn to behave themselves, lest they attract unwanted 
attention from local authorities. 
· 
That said, characters who don't go looking for trouble 
can take advantage of all the benefits that a settlement 
has to offer. 
LAW AND ORDER 
Whether a settlement has a police force depends on its 
size and nature. A lawful, orderly city might have a city 
watch to maintain order and a trained militia to defend 
its walls, and a frontier town might rely on adventurers 
or its citizenry to apprehend criminals and fend off 
attackers. 
TRIALS 
In most settlements, trials are overseen by magistrates 
or local lords. Some trials are argued, with the 
conflicting parties or their advocates presenting 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS 
precedent and evidence until the judge makes 
a decision. with or without the aid of spells or 
interrogation. Others are decided with a trial by ordeal 
or trial by combat. If the evidence against the accused 
is overwhelming, a magistrate or local lord can forgo a 
trial and skip right to the sentencing. 
SENTENCES 
A settlement might have a jail to hold accused criminals 
awaiting trial, but few settlements have prisons to 
incarcerate convicted criminals. A person found guilty 
of a crime is usually fined, condemned to forced labor 
for a period of several months or years, exiled, or 
executed, depending on the magnitude of the crime. 
RANDOM URBAN ENCOUNTERS 
The Random Urban Encounters table is useful for 
city- and town-based adventures. Check for a random 
encounter at least once per day, and once at night if 
the characters are out and about. Reroll the result if it 
doesn't make sense given the time of day.

Animals on the Loose. The characters see one or 
more unexpected animals loose in the street. This 
challenge could be anything from a pack of baboons to 
an escaped circus bear, tiger, or elephant. 
Announcement. A herald, town crier, mad person, 
or other individual makes an announcement on a 
street corner for all to hear. The announcement might 
foreshadow some upcoming event (such as a public 
execution), communicate important information to the 
general masses (such as a new royal decree), or convey a 
dire omen or warning. 
Brawl. A brawl erupts near the adventurers. It could 
be a tavern brawl; a battle between rival factions, 
families, or gangs in the city; or a struggle between 
city guards and criminals. The characters could be
