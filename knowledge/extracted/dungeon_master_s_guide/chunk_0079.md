In subterranean settlements, even races that have 
darkvision use fire for warmth, cooking, and defense. 
But many creatures have no need of warmth or light. 
Adventurers must bring their own sources of light into 
usty tombs where only undead stand guard, abandoned 
;uins teeming with predatory monsters and oozes, and 
natural caverns where sightless creatures hunt. 
The light of a torch or lantern helps a character 
: e over a short distance, but other creatures can 
: e that light source from far away. Bright light in an 
environment of total darkness can be visible for miles, 
j]ough a clear line of sight over such a distance is rare 
underground. Even so, adventurers using light sources 
JJ a dungeon often attract monsters, just as dungeon 
•eatures that shed light (from phosphorescent fungi 
-o the glow of magical portals) can draw adventurers' 
anention. 
_UR QUALITY 
ubterranean tunnels and aboveground ruins are often 
enclosed spaces with little airflow. Though it's rare for 
a dungeon to be sealed so tightly that adventurers have 
ouble breathing, the atmosphere is often stifling and 
oppressive. What's more, odors linger in a dungeon and 
can be magnified by the stillness of the atmosphere. 
OUNDS 
A dungeon's enclosed geography helps channel sound. 
The groaning creak of an opening door can echo down 
hundreds of feet of passageway. Louder·noises such 
a the clanging hammers of a forge or the din of battle 
can reverberate through an entire dungeon. Many 
creatures that live underground use such sounds as a 
"';'\ay of locating prey, or go on alert at any sound of an 
adventuring party's intrusion. 
DUNGEON HAZARDS 
The hazards described here are but a few examples of 
the environmental dangers found underground and in 
other dark places. Dungeon hazards are functionally 
imilar to traps, which are described at the end of 
this chapter. 
Detecting a Hazard. No ability check is required 
to spot a hazard unless it is hidden. A hazard that 
resembles something benign, such as a patch of slime 
or mold, can be correctly identified with a successful 
Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the guidelines in 
chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any check made 
to spot or recognize a hazard. 
Hazard Severity. To determine a hazard's deadliness 
relative to the characters, think of the hazard as a trap 
and compare the damage it deals with the party's level 
using the Damage Severity by Level table later in the 
chapter (the table also appears in chapter 8). 
BROWN MOLD 
Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from 
anything around it. A patch of brown mold typically 
covers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 
feet of it is always frigid. 
When a creature moves to within 5 feet of the mold 
for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it 
must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 
22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
Brown mold is immune to fire, and any source of fire 
brought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly 
expand outward in the direction of the fire, covering a 
10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the 
center of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to 
an effect that deals cold damage is instantly destroyed. 
GREEN SLIME 
This acidic slime devours flesh, organic material, and 
metal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings 
to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches. 
A patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square, has 
blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, and drops from 
walls and ceilings when it detects movement below it. 
Beyond that, it has no ability to move. A creature aware 
of the slime's presence can avoid being struck by it with 
a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, 
the slime can't be avoided as it drops. 
A creature that comes into contact with green slime 
takes 5 (1d10) acid damage. The creature takes the 
damage again at the start of each of its turns until the 
slime is scraped off or destroyed. Against wood or 
metal, green slime deals 11 (2d10) acid damage each 
round, and any nonmagical wood or metal weapon or 
tool used to scrape off the slime is effectively destroyed. 
Sunlight, any effect that cures disease, and any effect 
that deals cold, fire, or radiant damage destroys a patch 
of green slime. 
WEBS 
Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages 
and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled 
areas are difficult terrain. Moreover, a creature entering 
a webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its 
turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving 
throw or become restrained by the webs. A restrained 
creature can use its action to try to escape, doing 
so with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC 10, 15 
hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to 
bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage. 
YELLOW MOLD 
Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers 
a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of 
spores that fills a 10-foot cube originating from the 
mold. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 
15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison 
damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. While 
poisoned in this way, the creature takes 5 (1d10) poison 
damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. 
Sunlight or any amount of fire damage instantly 
destroys one patch of yellow mold.
