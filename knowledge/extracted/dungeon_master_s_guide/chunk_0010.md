SETTLEMENTS 
The places where people live-bustling cities, 
prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among 
miles of farmland- help define the nature of civilization 
in your world. A single settlement- a home base for 
your adventurers- is a great place to start a campaign 
and begin your world building. Consider the following 
questions as you create any settlement in your world: 
What purpose does it serve in your game? 
How big is it? Who lives there? 
What does it look, smell, a-nd sound like? 
Who governs it? Who else holds power? Is it part 
of a larger state? 
What are its defenses? 
• Where do characters go to find the goods and services 
they need? 
• What temples and other organizations feature 
prominently? 
• What fantastic elements distinguish it from an 
ordinary town? 
Why should the characters care about the settlement? 
The guidelines in this section are here to help you build 
the settlement you want for whatever purpose you have 
in mind. Disregard any advice here that runs counter to 
your vision for a settlement. 
PURPOSE 
A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story 
and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the 
settlement's purpose determines the amount of detail 
you put into it. Create only the features of a settlement 
that you know you'll need, along with notes on general 
features. Then allow the place to grow organically as the 
adventurers interact with more and more of it, keeping 
notes on new places you invent. 
LOCAL COLOR 
A settlement might serve as a place where the 
characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement 
of this sort needs no more than a brief description. 
Include the settlement's name, decide how big it is, 
add a dash of flavor ("The smell of the local tanneries 
never lifts from this town"), and let the adventurers get 
on with their business. The history of the inn where 
the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the 
shopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this 
level of detail, but you don't have to. If the characters 
return to the same settlement, start adding these local 
features so that it begins to feel a little more like a home 
base, albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop 
as the need arises. 
HOME BASE 
A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, 
train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire 
campaign can center on a particular town or city. 
Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the 
characters go out into the wider world. 
Designed well, a home base can hold a special place 
in the adventurers' hearts, particularly if they care about 
one or more NPCs who live there.

To make a home base come alive, you'll need to 
invest some time fleshing out details, but the players 
can help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit 
about mentors, family members, and other important 
people in their characters' lives. Feel free to add to and 
modify what they give you, but you'll start with a solid 
foundation of the non player characters (NPCs) who are 
important to the characters. Let the players describe 
where and how their characters spend their time- a 
favorite tavern, library, or temple, perhaps. 
Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point, 
flesh out the settlement's cast of characters. Detail 
its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed 
later in the chapter). Include characters who can 
provide information, such as sages, soothsayers, 
librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can 
provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note 
of merchants who might regularly interact with the 
adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for 
the party's business. Think about the people who run 
the adventurers' favorite tavern. And then add a handful 
of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired 
mercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a 
dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign. 
ADVENTURE SITE 
A village harboring a secret cult of devil worshipers. A 
town controlled by a guild of wererats. A city conquered 
by a hobgoblin army. These settlements aren't merely 
rest stops but locations where adventures unfold. In 
a settlement that doubles as an adventure location, 
detail the intended adventure areas, such as towers 
and warehouses. For an event-based adventure, note 
the NPCs who play a part in the adventure. This 
work is adventure preparation as much as it is world 
building, and the cast of characters you develop for 
your adventure-including allies, patrons, enemies, and 
extras- can become recurring figures in your campaign. 
SIZE 
Most settlements in a D&D world are villages clustered 
around a larger town or city. Farming villages supply the 
town or city population with food in exchange for goods 
the farmers can't produce themselves. Towns and cities 
are the seats of the nobles who govern the surrounding 
area, and who carry the responsibility for defending the 
villages from attack. Occasionally, a local lord or lady 
lives in a keep or fortress with no nearby town or city. 
VILLAGE 
Population: Up to about 1,000 
Government: A noble (usually not a resident) rules the 
village, with an appointed agent (a reeve) in residence 
to adjudicate disputes and collect taxes. 
Defense: The reeve might have a small force of soldiers. 
Otherwise, the village relies on a citizen militia. 
Commerce: Basic supplies are readily available, 
possibly from an· inn or a trading post. Other goods 
are available from traveling merchants. 
Organizations: A village might contain one or two 
temples or shrines, but few or no other organizations.
