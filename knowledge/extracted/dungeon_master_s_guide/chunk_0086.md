determining exhaustion. Swimming for an hour at a 
depth greater than 200 feet counts as 4 hours. 
N DERWATER VISIBILITY 
\'isibility underwater depends on water clarity and the 
available light. Unless the characters have light sources, 
use the Underwater Encounter Distance table to 
determine the distance at which characters underwater 
become aware of a possible encounter.

THE SEA 
Characters can row a boat for 8 hours per day, or can 
row longer at the risk of exhaustion (as per the rules for 
a forced march in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). A 
fully crewed sailing vessel can sail all day, assuming its 
sailors work in shifts. 
NAVIGATION 
Seagoing vessels stay close to shore when they can, 
because navigation is easier when landmarks are 
visible. As long as a ship is within sight of land, there 
is no chance of the vessel becoming lost. Otherwise, a 
ship's navigator must rely on dead reckoning (tracking

the direction and distance of the ship's travel) or the sun 
and the stars. 
Use the Wilderness Navigation table earlier in this 
chapter to determine whether a ship veers off course. 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS AT SEA 
You can check for random encounters at sea as often 
as you would check for them on land (see chapter 3 for 
more information). The Random Encounters at Sea 
table presents a number of options and ideas. 
SHIPWRECKS 
A shipwreck is a plot device that can be used sparingly to 
great effect, particularly if you want the characters to be 
washed ashore on some monster-infested island or (in the 
case of an airship) dropped in the middle of some exotic 
land. There aren't rules for determining when a shipwreck 
happens; it happens when you want or need it to happen. 
Even the strongest seafaring ship can founder in a storm, 
run aground on rocks or reefs, sink during a pirate attack, or 
be dragged underwater by a sea monster. A storm orhungry 
dragon can lay waste to an airship just as easily. A shipwreck 
has the potential to change the direction of a campaign. It 
isn't, however, a particularly good way to kill off characters or 
end a campaign . 
If you and your campaign conspire to wreck a ship on 
which the characters are traveling, it is assumed that the 
characters survive with the equipment they were wearing or 
carrying still in their possession. The fate of any N PCs and 
cargo aboard the wrecked ship is entirely up to you.

WEATHER AT S EA 
Use the Weather table earlier in this chapter when 
checking for weather at sea. 
If weather conditions indicate both a strong wind 
and heavy rain, they combine to create a storm with 
high waves. A crew caught in a storm loses sight of all 
landmarks (unless there's a lighthouse or other bright 
feature), and ability checks made to navigate during the 
storm have disadvantage.
