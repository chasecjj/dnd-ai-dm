cast magic missile. That same character could make 
a +1 weapon (another uncommon item), no particular 
spell required. 
You can decide that certain items also require special 
materials or locations to be created. For example, a 
character might need alchemist's supplies to brew a 
particular potion, or the formula for a flame tongue 
might require that the weapon be forged with lava.

An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting 
_ Iagic Items table. A character engaged in the crafting 
of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, 
-pending that amount for each day of work until the 
·oral cost is paid. The character is ass limed to work for 8 
._,ours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon 
;:nagic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to 
adjust the costs to better suit your campaign. 
If a spell will be produced by the item being created, 
-· e creator must expend one spell slot of the spell's 
,-eJ for each day of the creation process. The spell's 
::::~are rial components must also be at hand throughout 
· e process. If the spell normally consumes those 
;:omponents, they are consumed by the creation process. 
_ r the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as 
-c:ith a spell scroll, the components are consumed only 
_ ce by the process. Otherwise, the components are 
nsumed once each day of the item's creation. 
_ Iultiple characters can combine their efforts to 
::-eate a magic item if each of them meets the level 
:::-erequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell 
"' r . and components, as long as everyone participates 
:.Jing the entire crafting process. Each character 
an contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent 
ping to craft the item. 
_ ·ormally, a character who undertakes this activity 
-~ares a magic item described in chapter 7, "Treasure." 
-- _ our discretion, you can allow players to design their 
magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, 
~ungeon Master's Workshop." 
':hile crafting a magic item, a character can maintain 
odest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, 
-a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see 
-prer 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook). 
-__ .• ING RENOWN 
_ aracter can spend downtime improving his or 
_ renown within a particular organization (see 
-:;~nown" in chapter 1). Between adventures, a 
-racter undertakes minor tasks for the organization 
--' ocializes with its members. After pursuing these 
· ·iries for a combined number of days equal to his 
-er current renown multiplied by 10, the character's 
~m increases by 1. 
PERFORMING SACRED RITES 
A pious character can spend time between adventures 
performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god 
he or she reveres. Between rites, the character spends 
time in meditation and prayer. 
A character who is a priest in the temple can lead 
these rites, which might include weddings, funerals, and 
ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple 
or assist a priest with a rite. 
A character who spends at least 10 days performing 
sacred rites gains inspiration (described in chapter 4 of 
the Player's Handbook) at the start of each day for the 
next 2d6 days. 
RUNNING A BUSINESS 
Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have 
nothing to do with delving into dungeons or saving the 
world. A character might inherit a smithy, or the party 
might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a 
reward. If they hold on to the business, they might feel 
obliged to spend time between adventures maintaining 
the venture and making sure it runs smoothly. 
A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number 
of days spent on this downtime activity (maximum 30), 
then compares the total to the Running a Business table 
to determine what happens. 
If the character is required to pay a cost as a result 
of rolling on this table but fails to do so, the business 
begins to fail. For each unpaid debt incurred in this 
manner, the character takes a - 10 penalty to subsequent 
rolls made on this table.

SELLING MAGIC ITEMS 
Few people can afford to buy a magic item, and fewer 
still know how to find one. Adventurers are exceptional 
in this regard due to the nature of their profession. 
A character who comes into possession of a common, 
uncommon, rare, or very rare magic item that he or 
she wants to sell can spend downtime searching for a 
buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in 
a city or another location where one can find wealthy
