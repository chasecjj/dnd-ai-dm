RING OF ANIMAL INFL UENCE 
R ING O F 
D J INNI SuMMON I N G 
RING OF DJINNI SUMMONING 
Ring, legendary (requires attunement) 
While wearing this ring, you can speak its command 
word as an action to summon a particular djinni from 
the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni appears in an 
unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It 
remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating 
on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 
hit points. It then returns to its home plane. 
While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and 
your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no 
matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, 
the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no 
other actions. 
After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again 
for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the 
djinni dies.
