FIGURINE OF WONDROUS POWER 
Wondrous item, rarity by figurine 
A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast 
small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to 
speak the command word and throw the figurine to a 
point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine 
becomes a living creature. If the space where the 
creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or 
objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, 
the figurine doesn't become a creature. 
The creature is friendly to you and your companions. 
It understands your languages and obeys your spoken 
commands. If you issue no commands, the creature 
defends itself but takes no other actions. See the 
Monster Manual for the creature's statistics, except for 
the giant fly. 
The creature exists for a duration specific to each 
figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts 
to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it 
drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak 
the command word again while touching it. When the 
creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be 
used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as 
specified in the figurine's description. 
Bronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of 
a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 
hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 
5 days have passed. 
Ebony Fly (Rare). This ebony statuette is carved in 
the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for 
up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once 
it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 day 
have passed.

Golden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of lions 
are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or 
both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 
hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again 
until 7 days have passed. 
Ivory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of goats 
are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks 
unique and functions differently from the others. Their 
properties are as follows: 
The goat of traveling can become a Large goat 
with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 
charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends 
in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, 
you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out 
of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used 
again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all 
its charges. 
The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 
hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again 
until 30 days have passed.
