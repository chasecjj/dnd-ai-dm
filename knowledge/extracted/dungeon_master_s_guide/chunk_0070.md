BOND 
In a sentence, summarize the people, places, or things 
that are especially important to the NPC. The NPC 
Bonds table offers suggestions in broad categories. 
The character backgrounds in the Player's Handbook 
explore bonds in more detail, and player characters who 
uncover an NPC's bond can use what they've learned to 
influence the NPC in a social interaction (as discussed 
in chapter 8).

F L AW OR SECRET 
In one sentence, describe the NPC's flaw-some 
element of the character's personality or history that 
could potentially undermine the character-or a secret 
that the NPC is trying to hide. 
The NPC Flaws and Secrets table provides several 
ideas. The backgrounds in the Player's Handbook 
can be used to create more detailed flaws. Player 
characters who uncover an NPC's flaw or secret can use 
what they've learned to influence the NPC in a social 
interaction (as discussed in chapter 8).

MoNsTERS As NPCs 
_ amed monsters that play a significant role in an 
adventure deserve the same attention you would give to 
a humanoid NPC, with mannerisms as well as ideals, 
bonds, flaws, and secrets. If a beholder mastermind 
is behind the criminal activities in a city, don't rely 
olely on the entry in the Monster Manual to describe 
the creature's appearance and personality. Take the 


--- Page 92 ---

time to give it a bit of background, a distinctive quirk of 
appearance, and especially an ideal, a bond, and a flaw. 
As an example, consider the Xanathar, a beholder 
that runs extensive criminal operations in the city of 
Waterdeep. The Xanathar's spherical body is covered in 
leathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its 
eyes talks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some 
of the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar's 
speech is slow and deliberate, and it prefers to turn its 
central eye away from creatures it speaks to. Like all 
beholders, it sees other creatures as inferiors, though 
it understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions. 
The Xanathar uses the sewers beneath Waterdeep to 
access virtually any location within or under the city. 
The Xanathar's ideal is greed. It craves powerful 
magic items and surrounds itself with gold, platinum, 
and precious gems. Its bond is to its lair-an elaborate 
cavern complex carved out between the twisting sewers 
ofWaterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors 
and cherishes above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for 
exotic pleasures: finely prepared foods, scented oils, and 
rare spices and herbs. 
Establishing this information allows you to play the 
Xanathar as more than an ordinary beholder. The 
complexities of the creature's characterization create 
more memorable interaction and interesting story 
possibilities. 
NPC STATISTICS 
When you give an NPC game statistics, you have three 
main options: giving the NPC only the few statistics it 
needs, give the NPC a monster stat block, or give the 
NPC a class and levels. The latter two options require a 
bit of explanation. 
/ 
USING A MONSTER S-TAT BLOCK 
Appendix B of the l}f-<:fnster Manual contains statistics 
for many gen~;pe-i"fPCs that you can customize as you 
ee-fit;"affi!Chapter 9 of this book offers guidelines on 
adjusting their statistics and creating a new stat block. 
USING CLASSES AND LEVELS 
You can create an NPC just as you would a player 
character, using the rules in the Player's Handbook. 
You can even use a character sheet to keep track of the 
NPC's vital information. 
Class Options. In addition to the class options in the 
Player's Handbook, two additional class options are 
available for evil player characters and NPCs: the Dea ._ 
domain for clerics and the oathbreaker for paladins. 
Both options are detailed at the end of this chapter. 
Equipment. Most NPCs don't need an exhaustive lis 
of equipment. An enemy meant to be faced in combat 
requires weapons and armor, plus any treasure the 
NPC carries (including magic items that might be used 
against the adventurers). 
Challenge Rating. An NPC built for combat needs a 
challenge rating. Use the rules in chapter 9 to determin 
the NPC's challenge rating, just as you would for a 
monster you designed. 
NPC PARTY MEMBERS 
NPCs might join the adventuring party because they 
want a share of the loot and are willing to accept 
an equal share of the risk, or they might follow the 
adventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude, 
or love. Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you 
can transfer control to the players. Even if a player 
controls an NPC, it's up to you to make sure the NPC i 
portrayed as a character in his or her own right, not jus· 
as a servant that the players can manipulate for their 
own benefit. 
Any NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as 
a party member and earns a full share of experience 
points. When determining the difficulty of a combat 
encounter (see chapter 3), make sure to include all NPC 
party members. 
Low-LEVEL FoLLOWERS 
Your campaign might allow player characters to take on 
lower-level NPCs as followers. For example, a paladin 
might have a 1st-level paladin as a squire, a wizard 
might accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice, a 
cleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as 
an acolyte, and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as 
an understudy. 
One advantage of allowing lower-level characters to 
join the party is that players have backup characters if 
their main characters take time off, retire, or die. One 
disadvantage is that you and your players have more 
party members to account for. 
Since lower-level NPC party members receive equal 
party shares of XP, they will gain levels more quickly 
than the adventurers (the benefit of studying under such 
experienced masters), and might eventually catch up to 
them. It also means the adventurers' advancement is 
slowed somewhat, as they must share their XP with an 
NPC shouldering only part of the adventuring burden. 
Powerful monsters that are an appropriate challenge 
for higher-level characters can deal enough damage to 
instantly kill or incapacitate a low-level follower. The 
adventurers should expect to spend effort and resources
