You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead 
of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, 
that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. 
The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 
15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. 
The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can 
use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright 
and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet 
each or a minimum of 10 feet each. 
SWORD OF ANSWERING 
Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by
