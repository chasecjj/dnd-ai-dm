CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
challenge rating 1 monster is 13, but if your monster is 
well armored, raise its AC accordingly. Don't worry if 
the monster's AC isn't matching up with the expected 
challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affec· 
a monster's challenge rating, as shown in later steps. 
Determine an Appropriate AC. Alternatively, you car: 
determine an appropriate AC based on the type of arm -
the monster wears, its natural armor, or some other 
Armor Class booster (such as the mage armor spell). 
Again, don't worry if the monster's AC isn't matching u 
with the expected challenge rating for the monster. 
If your monster wears manufactured armor, its 
Armor Class is based on the type of armor worn (see 
the Player's Handbook for armor types). If the monster 
carries a shield, apply the shield bonus to its AC 
as normal. 
A monster that doesn't wear armor might have natur2 
armor, in which case it has an AC equal to 10 +its 
Dexterity modifier+ its natural armor bonus. A mons£ 
with a thick hide generally has a natural armor bonu 
of +1 to +3. The bonus can be higher if the creature 
is exceptionally well armored. A gorgon, for example. 
is covered in steely plates and has a natural armor 
bonus of+9. 
STEP 8. HIT POINTS 
A monster's hit points have a direct bearing on its 
challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine y 
-
monster's hit points in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 
expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an 
appropriate number of hit points. The table presents a 
range of hit points for each challenge rating. 
Assign Hit Dice. Alternatively, you can assign a 
number of Hit Dice to a monster, then calculate its 
average hit points. Don't worry if the hit points aren t 
matching up with the expected challenge rating for the 
monster. Other factors can affect a monster's challenge 
rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always 
adjust a monster's Hit Dice and hit points later on. 
A monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want. 
but the size of the die used to calculate its hit points 
depends on the monster's size, as shown in the Hit Di 
by Size table. For example, a Medium monster uses d~: 
for hit points, so a Medium monster with 5 Hit Dice ru::-
a Constitution of 13 (+1 modifier) has 5d8 +5 hit poin-" 
A monster typically has average hit points based on ·-~ 
Hit Dice. For example, a creature with 5d8 + 5 hit poi 
has an average of 27 hit points (5 x 4.5 + 5).

STEP 9. DAMAGE VuL "ER..'\BILITIES , 
RESISTANCES, AND hnn ; . "ITIE 
Decide whether your mon ter ha \·ulnerability, 
resistance, or immunity to one or more types of 
damage (see the Players Handbook for descriptions 
of the various damage types). . 
ign a vulnerability, 
resistance, or immunity to a mon ter only when it's 
intuitive. For example, it make 
en e for a monster 
made of molten lava to have immunity to fire damage. 
Giving a monster resistances and immunities to three 
or more damage types (especially bludgeoning, piercing, 
and slashing damage) is like gi\·ing it extra hit points. 
However, adventurers have more resources at higher 
levels to counteract such defense . making resistances 
and immunities less relevant at higher levels. 
Effective Hit Points. If a monster has resistance 
or immunity to several damage types- especially 
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from 
nonmagical weapons-and not all the characters in the 
party possess the means to counteract that resistance 
or immunity, you need to take these defenses into 
account when comparing your monster's hit points to its 
expected challenge rating. Using the Effective Hit Points 
Based on Resistances and Immunities table, apply 
the appropriate multiplier to the monster's hit points 
to determine its effective hit points for the purpose of 
gauging its final challenge rating. (The monster's actual 
hit points shouldn't change.) 
For example, a monster with an expected 
challenge rating of 6, 150 hit points, and resistance 
to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from 
nonmagical weapons effectively has 225 hit points 
(using the 1.5 multiplier for resistances) for the purpose 
of gauging its final challenge rating. 
Monsters don't normally have vulnerability to more 
than one or two types of damage. Vulnerabilities don't 
significantly affect a monster's challenge rating, unless 
a monster has vulnerabilities to multiple damage types 
that are prevalent, especially bludgeoning, piercing, 
and slashing. For such a strange monster, reduce its 
effective hit points by half. Or even better, eliminate 
the vulnerabilities and give the brittle monster fewer 
hit points.

STEP 10. ATTACK BONUSES 
A monster's attack bonuses have a direct bearing on its 
challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a 
monster's attack bonuses in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 
expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an 
appropriate attack bonus for all the monster's attacks, 
regardless of its ability scores. 
The table provides the baseline attack bonus for each 
challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the attack bonus as 
you see fit to match whatever concept you have in mind. 
For example, the baseline attack bonus for a challenge 
rating 1 monster is +3, but if your monster needs more 
accuracy, raise its bonus accordingly. Don't worry if 
the monster's attack bonus isn't matching up with the 
expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors 
can affect a monster's challenge rating, as shown in 
later steps. 
Calculate Attack Bonuses. Alternatively, you can 
calculate a monster's attack bonuses the same way 
players calculate the attack bonuses of a character. 
Wpen a monster has an action that requires an attack 
roll, its attack bonus is equal to its proficiency bonus+ 
its Strength or Dexterity modifier. A monster usually 
applies its Strength modifier to melee attacks and its 
Dexterity modifier to ranged attacks, although smaller 
monsters sometimes use Dexterity for both. 
Again, don't worry if the attack bonuses aren't 
matching up with the expected challenge rating for 
the monster. You can always adjust a monster's attack 
bonuses later. 
STEP 11. DAMAGE 
A monster's damage output- the amount of damage it 
deals every round-has a direct bearing on its challenge 
rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster's 
damage output in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 
expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine how 
much damage the monster should deal every round. 
The table presents a range at each challenge rating. 
It doesn't matter how this damage is apportioned or 
distributed; for example, a monster might deal the 
damage every round with a single attack, or the damage 
could be split among multiple attacks against one or 
more foes. 
Choose the type of damage based on how you imagine 
the damage being delivered. For example, if the monster 
is attacking with razor-sharp claws, the damage it deals 
is probably slashing damage. If its claws are poisonous, 
some portion of the damage might be poison damage 
instead of slashing damage. 
If you want the damage output to vary slightly from 
round to round, you can translate the damage range into 
a single die expression (for a monster with one attack) 
or multiple die expressions (for a monster with multiple 
attacks). For example, a challenge rating 2 monster 
deals 15- 20 damage per round. If you imagine the 
creature having a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier), you could 
give it one melee attack that deals 3d8 + 4 (average 
17.5) damage, split the damage output into two separate 
attacks that deal1d10 + 4 (average 9) damage each; or 
use any other combination where the average damage 
output falls within the desired range. 
Base the Damage on the Weapon. Alternatively, 
you can use a die expression to represent the damage 
that a monster deals with each of its attacks based on 
whatever weapon it is using.
