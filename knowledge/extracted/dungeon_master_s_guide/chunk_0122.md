uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies 
it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check. The creature then appears 
translucent. 
The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion 
is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its 
card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

DECK OF MANY THINGS 
Wondrous item, legendary 
Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains 
a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 
percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the 
rest have twenty-two. 
Before you draw a card, you must declare how many 
cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly 
(you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate 
the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number 
have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card 
from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw 
each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. 
If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take 
effect all at once. 
Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unles~ 
the card is the Fool or the jester, the card reappears 
in the deck, making it possible to draw the same 
card twice.

Balance. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, 
causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes 
chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are 
true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you. 
Comet. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile 
monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain 
experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, 
this card has no effect. 
Donjon. You disappear and become entombed in a 
state of suspended animation in an extradimensional 
sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying 
stays behind in the space you occupied when you 
disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found 
and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by 
A QUESTION OF ENMITY 
Two of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character 
the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the 
enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's 
malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the 
fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should 
clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before 
being able to confront the devil itself. 
In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and 
should come from someone thought to be a friend or an 
ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically 
appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the 
adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.
