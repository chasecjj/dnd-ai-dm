A character should receive only a blessing that is 
useful to him or her, and some blessings come with 
expectations on the part of the benefactor. A god 
typically gives a blessing for a particular purpose, such 
as recovering a holy person's remains or toppling a 
tyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing 
if a character fails to pursue that purpose or acts 
counter to it. 
A character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or 
until it is taken away by the god who granted it. Unlike 
a magic item, such a blessing can't be suppressed by an 
anti magic field or similar effect. 
Most adventurers go their entire lives without 
receiving even one of these blessings. There is no limit 
on the number of blessings a character can receive, 
but it should be rare for a character to have more than 
one at a time. Moreover, a character can't benefit from 
multiple instances of a blessing at the same time. For / 
example, a character can't benefit from two instances,s>f 
the Blessing of Health at once. 
Example blessings are provided below. The text of a 
blessing addresses its user. If you decide to create more 
blessings, consider this: a typical blessing mimics the 
properties of a wondrous item. 
Blessing of Health. Your Constitution score increases 
by 2, up to a maximum of 22. 
Blessing of Protection. You gain a +1 bonus to AC 
and saving throws. 
Blessing of Magic Resistance. You have advantage on 
saving throws against spells and other magical effects. 
Blessing of Understanding. Your Wisdom score 
increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22. 
Blessing ofValhaJJa. This blessing grants you the 
power to summon spirit warriors, as if you had blown a 
silver horn of Valhalla. Once you use this blessing, you 
can't use it again until 7 days have passed. 
Blessing of Weapon Enhancement. One nonmagical 
weapon in your possession becomes a +1 weapon 
whenever you wield it. 
Blessing of Wound Closure. This blessing grants you 
the benefits of a periapt of wound closure. 
CHARMS 
A charm is a minor supernatural gift, which can 
be received in a large variety of ways. For example, 
a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead 
arch mage's spellbook might be infused with the magic 
of a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx's 
riddle or drinks from a magic fountain. Legendary 
creatures, such as ancient gold dragons and unicorns, 
sometimes grace their allies with charms, and some 
explorers find themselves bearing the magic of a charm 
after discovering a long-lost location that is drenched in 
primeval magic. 
Some charms can be used only once, and others can 
be used a specific number of times before vanishing. If a 
charm lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without 
spending a spell slot or providing any components 
(verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can't 
be used in the area created by an antimagic field or a 
similar effect, and a charm's effects are susceptible to 
dispel magic and the like. But the charm itself can't be

removed from a creature by anything short of divine 
intervention or the wish spell. 
Example charms are provided below. The text of a 
charm addresses its user. A typical charm mimics the 
effects of a potion or a spell, so it is easy to create more 
charms of your own, if you like. 
Charm of Animal Conjuring. This charm allows 
you to cast the conjure animals spell (3rd-level version 
as an action. Once used three times, the charm 
vanishes from you. 
Charm ofDarkvision. This charm allows you to 
cast the darkvision spell as an action, no components 
required. Once used three times, the charm goes awa_ 
Charm of Feather FaJJing. This charm grants you --
benefits of a ring of feather falling. These benefits last 
for 10 days, after which the charm vanishes from you. 
Charm of Heroism. This charm allows you to give 
yourself the benefit of a potion of heroism as an action. 
Once you do so, the charm vanishes from you. 
Charm of Restoration. This charm has 6 charges. 
You can use an action to expend some of its charges 
to cast one of the following spells: greater restoration 
(4 charges) or Jesser restoration (2 charges). Once 
all its charges have been expended, the charm 
vanishes from you. 
Charm of the Slayer. One sword in your possession 
becomes a dragon slayer or giant slayer (DM's choice) 
for the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes from you 
and the weapon returns to normal. 
Charm of Vitality. This charm allows you to give 
yourself the benefit of a potion of vitality as an action. 
Once you do so, the charm vanishes from you. 
MARKS OF PRESTIGE 
Sometimes the most memorable reward for adventure~ 
is the prestige that they acquire throughout a realm. 
Their adventures often earn them fame and power, 
allies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to 
their descendants. Some lords and ladies began as 
commoners who ventured into the dangerous places oi 
the world and made names for themselves through the -
brave deeds. 
This section details the most common marks of 
prestige that adventures might acquire during a 
campaign. These marks are usually gained along with 
treasure, but sometimes they stand on their own. 
LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION 
When gold is in short supply, the adventurers' 
benefactor might provide them with a letter of 
recommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a 
letter is usually enclosed in a handsome folio, case, or 
scroll tube for safe transport, and it usually bears the 
signature and seal of whoever wrote it. 
A letter of recommendation from a person of 
impeccable reputation can grant adventurers access 
to NPCs that they would otherwise have trouble 
meeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or queen. 
Moreover, carrying such a recommendation on one's 
person can help clear up "misunderstandings" with 
local authorities who might not otherwise take the 
adventurers at their word.
