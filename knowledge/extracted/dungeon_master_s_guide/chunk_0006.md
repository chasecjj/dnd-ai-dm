for example, might also be patron of magic and

and the god of time. 
A SAMPLE PANTHEON 
The pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a 
pantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements 
to suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is 
the default pantheon in the fourth edition Player's 
Handbook (2008). The pantheon is summarized in the 
Dawn War Deities table. 
This pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities 
and establishes them as universal gods. These gods 
include Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin, 
Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and 
Corell on as gods of their respective portfolios, rather 
than as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the 
archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and tyranny. 
Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, 
sometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes 
from the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come 
Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek 
pantheon come Athena (renamed Era this) and Tyche 
(renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set 
(renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon. 
The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon's He! 
and Greyhawk's Weejas. That leaves three gods created 
from scratch: Ioun, Melora, and Torog: 
OTHER RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS 
In your campaign, you can create pantheons of gods 
who are closely linked in a single religion, monotheistic 
religions (worship of a single deity), dualistic systems 
(centered on two opposing deities or forces), mystery 
cults (involving personal devotion to a single deity, 
usually as part of a pantheon system), anjmistic 
religions (revering the spirits inherent in nature), or 
even forces and philosophies that don't center on deities. 
TIGHT PANTHEONS 
In contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses 
on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace 
a small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon 
might favor one of its member deities over another, 
but they respect all the deities and honor them with 
sacrifices and prayer as appropriate. 
The key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers 
embrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the 
deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to 
protect and guide their followers. You can think of a 
tight pantheon as similar to a family. One or two deities 
who lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with 
the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the 
culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple 
honors all members of the pantheon. 
Most tight pantheons have one or more aberrant 
gods-deities whose worship isn't sanctioned by the 
priests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually 
evil deities and enemies of the pantheon, such as the 
Greek Titans. These deities have cults of their own, 
attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship. 
These cults resemble mystery cults, their members 
strictly devoted to their single god, though even 
members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples 
of the tight pantheon. 
The Norse deities serve as an example of a tight 
pantheon. Odin is the pantheon's leader and father 
figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr, and Freya embody 
important aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki 
and his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding 
the other deities, and sometimes working against them 
with the pantheon's enemies. 
MYSTERY CULTS 
A mystery cult is a secretive religious organization 
based on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is 
mystically identified with a god, or a handful of related 
gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned 
with the initiate's relationship with the divine. 
Sometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within 
a pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of 
the pantheon, but presents its own myths and rites as 
primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might 
immerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god 
who is part of a broadly worshiped pantheon. 
A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god, 
which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. 
The foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple 
and often involves a god's death and rising, or a journey 
to the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often 
revere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities-
gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature. 
DIVINE RANK 
The divine beings of the multiverse are often categorized 
according to their cosmic power. Some gods are worshiped 
on multiple worlds and have a different rank on each world, 
depending on their influence there. 
Greater deities are beyond mortal understanding. They 
can't be summoned, and they are almost always removed 
from direct involvement in mortal affairs. On very rare 
occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities, but 
slaying a greater god's avatar has no effect on the god itself. 
Lesser deities are embodied somewhere in the planes. 
Some lesser deities live in the Material Plane, as does the 
unicorn-goddess Lurue of the Forgotten Realms and the 
titanic shark-god Sekolah revered by the sahuagin. Others 
live on the Outer Planes, as Lolth does in the Abyss. Such 
deities can be encountered by mortals. 
Quasi-deities have a divine origin, but they don't hear or 
answer prayers, grant spells to clerics, or control aspects of 
mortal life. They are still immensely powerful beings, and in 
theory they could ascend to godhood if they amassed enough 
worshipers. Quasi-deities fall into three subcategories: 
demigods, titans, and vestiges. 
Demigods are born from the union of a deity and a mortal 
being. They have some divine attributes, but their mortal 
parentage makes them the weakest quasi-deities. 
Titans are the divine creations of deities. They might be 
birthed from the union of two deities, manufactured on 
a divine forge, born from the blood spilled by a god, or 
otherwise brought about through divine will or substance. 
Vestiges are deities who have lost nearly all their worshipers 
and are considered dead, from a mortal perspective. Esoteric 
rituals can sometimes contact these beings and draw on 
their latent power.
