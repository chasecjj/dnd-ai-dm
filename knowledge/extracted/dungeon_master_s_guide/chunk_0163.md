CHARACTERISTICS 
Use the information on creating NPCs in chapter 4 
to develop a sentient item's mannerisms, personality 
traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. You can also draw on the 
"Special Features" section earlier in this chapter. 
If you determine these characteristics randomly, 
ignore or adapt any result that doesn't make sense 
for an inanimate object. You can reroll until you get a 
result you like. 
SPECIAL P U RPOSE 
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, 
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the 
wielder's use of the item aligns with that special 
purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from 
this course might cause conflict between the wielder 
and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent 
the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special 
purpose or roll on the following table. 
dlO 
Purpose 
Aligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those 
of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an 
item is never neutral.) 
2 
Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures 
of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, 
trolls, or wizards. 
3 
Protector: The item seeks to defend a particular 
race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids. 
4 
Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or 
destroy the servants of a particular deity. 
5 
Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants 
and interests of a particular deity. 
6 
Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads 
its user to fight arbitrarily. 
7 
Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the 
greatest magic item in the world , by establishing 
its user as a famous or notorious figure. 
• 
8 
Lore Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is 
determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or 
unravel a cryptic prophecy. 
9 
Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its 
wielder have key roles to play in future events. 
10 
Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and 
wants to understand why it was created. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
CONFLICT 
A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its 
personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a 
manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, 
conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item 
makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's 
Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it make 
one or more of the following demands: 
The item insists on being carried or worn at all times 
The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything 
the item finds repugnant. 
• The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's 
goals to the exclusion of all other goals. 
The item demands to be given to someone else. 
If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes 
the item can do any or all of the following: 
Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it. 
Suppress one or more of its activated properties. 
Attempt to take control of its wielder. 
If a sentient item attempts to take control of its 
wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving 
throw, with a DC equal to 12 +the item's Charisma 
modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by 
item for ld12 hours. While charmed, the wielder mus 
try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes 
damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effe 
on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user 
succeeds or fails, the item can't use this power again 
until the next dawn. 
SAMPLE SENTIENT ITEMS 
The sentient weapons described here have storied 
histories. 
BLACKRAZOR 
Weapon (greats word), legendary (requires attunemenc 
by a creature of non-lawful alignment) 
Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, 
Blackrazor shines like a piece of night sky filled with 
stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of 
cut obsidian. 
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. It has the following addition~ 
properties. 
Devour Soul. Whenever you use it to reduce a 
creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature 
devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead .. -. 
creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor 
can be restored to life only by a wish spell. 
When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you 
temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit 
point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. 
As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep 
Blackrazor in hand, you have advantage on attack roll . 
saving throws, and ability checks. 
If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take ldlO 
necrotic damage and the target regains ldlO hit point 
If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, 
Blackrazor devours your soul.
