WAND OF THE WAR MAGE, +1, +2 , OR +3 
Wand, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) 
(requires attunement by a spellcaster) 
While holding this wand, you gain a bonus to spell 
attack rolls determined by the wand's rarity. In addition, 
you ignore half cover when making a spell attack. 
WAND OF WEB 
Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) 
This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use 
an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the web spell 
(save DC 15) from it. 
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. 
On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed. 
WAND OF WONDER 
Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster) 
This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use 
an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target 
within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an 
object, or a point in space. Roll dlOO and consult the 
following table to discover what happens. 
If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, 
the spell's save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a 
range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it 
isn't already. 
If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell 
on and include the target. If an effect has multiple 
possible subjects, the DM randomly determines which 
ones are affected. 
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. 
On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
