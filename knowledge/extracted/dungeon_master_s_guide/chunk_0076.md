beholder·s disintegration eye ray have walls that are 
un naturally smooth, and the beholder's lair might 
include vertical shafts connecting different levels. 
Amphibious monsters such as kuo-toa and aboleths use 
water to protect the innermost reaches of their lairs 
from air-breathing intruders. 
Details bring a dungeon setting's personality to life. 
Great bearded faces might be carved on the doors of a 
dwarven stronghold and might be defaced by the gnolls 
who live there now. Spiderweb decorations, torture 
chambers, and slave pens might be common features 
in a vault built by drow, telling something about that 
location and its occupants. 
The Dungeon Creator table includes creatures that 
typically build dungeons. You can choose a creator 
from the table or roll randomly, or choose some other 
dungeon builder appropriate for your campaign.

DUNGEON PURPOSE 
Except in the case of a natural cavern, a dungeon 
· crafted and inhabited for a specific purpose that 
influences its design and features. You can choose a 
purpose from the Dungeon Purpose table, roll one at 
;--andom, or use your own ideas.

Death Trap. This dungeon is built to eliminate any 
creature that dares to enter it. A death trap might guard 
the treasure of an insane wizard, or it might be designed 
o lure adventurers to their demise for some nefarious 
purpose, such as to feed souls to a lich's phylactery. 
Lair. A lair is a place where monsters live. Typical 
airs include ruins and caves. 
Maze. A maze is intended to deceive oi- confuse 
those who enter it. Some mazes are elaborate obstacles 
that protect treasure, while others are gauntlets for 
prisoners banished there to be hunted and devoured by 
the monsters within. 
Mine. An abandoned mine can quickly become 
infested with monsters, while miners who delve too 
deep can break through into the Underdark. 
Planar Gate. Dungeons built around planar portals 
are often transformed by the planar energy seeping out 
through those portals. 
Stronghold. A stronghold dungeon provides a secure 
base of operations for villains and monsters. It is 
ually ruled by a powerful individual, such as a wizard, 
·:ampire, or dragon, and it is larger and more complex 
ilian a simple lair. 
Temple or Shrine. This dungeon is consecrated to 
a deity or other planar entity. The entity's worshipers 
control the dungeon and conduct their rites there. 
Tomb. Tombs are magnets for treasure hunters, as 
well as monsters that hunger for the bones of the dead. 
Treasure Vault. Built to protect powerful magic items 
and great material wealth, treasure vault dungeons are 
: eavily guarded by monsters and traps. 
HISTORY 
n most cases, the original architects of a dungeon are 
ong gone, and the question of what happened to them 
can help shape the dungeon's current state. 
The Dungeon History table notes key events that 
can transform a site from its original purpose into a 
dungeon for adventurers to explore. Particularly old 
dungeons can have a history that consists of multiple 
events, each of which transformed the site in some way.

DUNGEON INHABITANTS 
After a dungeon's creators depart, anyone or anything 
might move in. Intelligent monsters, mindless dungeon 
scavengers, predators and prey alike can be drawn 
to dungeons. 
The monsters in a dungeon are more than a 
collection of random creatures that happen to live 
near one another. Fungi, vermin, scavengers, and 
predators can coexist in a complex ecology, alongside 
intelligent creatures who share living space through 
elaborate combinations of domination, negotiation, and 
bloodshed. 
Characters might be able to sneak into a dungeon, 
ally with one faction, or play factions against each other 
to reduce the threat of the more powerful monsters. 
For example, in a dungeon inhabited by mind !layers 
and their goblinoid thralls, the adventurers might try 
to incite the goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears to revolt 
against their illithid masters. 
DUNGEON FACTIONS 
A dungeon is sometimes dominated by a single group 
of intelligent humanoids, whether a tribe of orcs 
that have taken over a cavern complex or a gang of 
trolls inhabiting an aboveground ruin. Other times, 
particularly in larger dungeons, multiple groups of 
creatures share space and compete for resources. 
For example, orcs that dwell in the mines of a ruined 
dwarf citadel might skirmish constantly against the 
hobgoblins that hold the citadel's upper tiers. Mind 
!layers that have established a colony in the lowest 
levels of the mines could manipulate and dominate key 
hobgoblins in an attempt to wipe out the orcs. And all 
the while, a hidden cell of drow scouts watches and 
plots to slay the mind !layers, then enslave whatever 
creatures are left. 
It's easy to think of a dungeon as a collection of 
encounters, with the adventurers kicking down door
