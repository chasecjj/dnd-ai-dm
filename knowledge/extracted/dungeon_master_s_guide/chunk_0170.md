VILE LORE 
The Book ofVile Darkness touches on every evil in the 
cosmos. A character can use the lore the book contains 
to unearth terrible secrets no mortal should know. Among 
the contents a character might find are the following, plus 
whatever else you choose: 
Vile Apotheosis. The book could hold a ritual that allows a 
character to become a lich or death knight. 
True Names. The true names of any number of fiends 
might be in the book. 
Dark Magic. Several spells of horrific evil of the OM's 
design and choosing could be in the book. Spells could 
impose dreadful curses, disfigure others, require human 
sacrifice, afflict creatures with crippling pain, spread vile 
plagues, and so on. 
A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours 
reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its 
benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's 
contents, provided that those modifications advance evil 
and expand the lore already contained within. 
Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book 
of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's 
alignment changes to neutral evil. 
The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only 
as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you 
fail to perform at least one evil act within the span 
of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the 
book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, 
an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be 
restored to life by any means while your soul remains 
imprisoned. 
Random Properties. The Book of Vile Darkness has 
the following random properties: 
3 minor beneficial properties 
• 1 major beneficial property 
3 minor detrimental properties 
2 major detrimental properties 
Adjusted Ability Scores. After you spend the 
requisite amount of time reading and studying the 
book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to 
a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice 
decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't 
adjust your ability scores again. 
Mark of Darkness. After you spend the requisite 
amount of time reading and studying the book, you 
acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign 
of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might 
appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy 
black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or 
you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial 
features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature 
the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you 
advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to 
interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) 
checks made to interact with non-evil creatures. 
Command Evil. While you are attuned to the book 
and holding it, you can use an action to cast the 
dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). 
You can't use this property again until the next dawn.

Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action
