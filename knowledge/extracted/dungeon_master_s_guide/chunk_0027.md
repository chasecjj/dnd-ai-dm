CHARACTER NAMES 
Part of your campaign style has to do with naming 
characters. It's a good idea to establish some ground 
rules with your players at the start of a new campaign. 
In a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna, 
and Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out, 
especially when he's identical to Bob I, who was killed 
by kobolds. If everyone takes a lighthearted approach 
to names, that's fine. If the group would rather take the 
characters and their names a little more seriously, urge 
Bob's player to come up with a more appropriate name. 
Player character names should match each other 
in flavor or concept, and they should also match the 
flavor of your campaign world-so should the non player 
characters' names and place names you create. Travok 
and Kairon don't want to undertake a quest for Lord 
Cupcake, visit Gumdrop Island, or take down a crazy 
wizard named Ray. 
CONTINUING OR 
EPISODIC CAMPAIGNS 
The backbone of a campaign is a connected series 
of adventures, but you can connect them in two 
different ways. 
In a continuing campaign, the connected adventures 
share a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring 
theme (or themes). The adventures might feature 
returning villains, grand conspiracies, or a single 
mastermind who's ultimately behind every adventure 
of the campaign. 
A continuing campaign designed with a theme and 
a story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic. 
The players derive the satisfaction of knowing the 
actions they take during one adventure matter in the 
next. Plotting and running that kind of campaign can 
be demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and 
memorable story. 
An episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a television 
show where each week's episode is a self-contained 
story that doesn't play into any overarching plot. It 
might be built on a premise that explains its nature: the 
player characters are adventurers-for-hire, or explorers 
venturing into the unknown and facing a string of 
unrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists, 
venturing into one ancient ruin after another in search 
of artifacts. An episodic game like this lets you create 
adventures-or buy published ones- and drop them into 
your campaign without worrying about how they fit with 
the adventures that came before and follow after. 
CAMPAIGN THEME 
A theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature, 
expresses the deeper meaning of a story and the 
fundamental elements of human experience that the 
story explores. Your campaign doesn't have to be a work 
of literature, but it can still draw on common themes 
that lend a distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider 
these examples: 
CHAPTER I I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
A campaign about confronting the inevitability of 
mortality, whether embodied in undead monsters or 
expressed through the death of loved ones. 
A campaign revolving around an insidious evil, 
whether dark gods, monstrous races such as the 
yuan-ti, or creatures of unknown realms far removed 
from mortal concerns. As heroes confront this evil, 
they must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their own 
kind as well. 
A campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront 
not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the 
world, but also the beast within- the rage and fury 
that lies in their own hearts. 
A campaign exploring the insatiable thirst for power 
and domination, whether embodied by the hosts of the 
Nine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering 
the world. 
With a theme such as "confrontation with mortality," 
you can craft a broad range of adventures that aren't 
necessarily connected by a common villain. One 
adventure might feature the dead bursting from their 
graves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town. 
In the next adventure, a mad wizard creates a flesh 
golem in an effort to revive his lost love. A villain could 
go to extreme lengths to achieve immortality to avoid 
confronting its own demise. The adventurers might 
help a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the 
adventurers might even become a ghost! 
VARIATIONS ON A THEME 
Mixing things up once in a while allows your players 
to enjoy a variety of adventures. Even a tightly themed 
campaign can stray now and then. If your campaign 
heavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying, your 
players might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl-
especially if the tangent is revealed to relate to a larger 
plot irr the campaign. If most of your adventures are 
dungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense urban 
mystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon 
crawl in an abandoned building or tower. If you run 
horror adventures week after week, try using a villain 
who turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even silly. Comic 
relief is a great variation on almost any D&D campaign, 
though players usually provide it themselves. 
TIERS OF PLAY 
As characters grow in power, their ability to change the 
world around them grows with them. It helps to think 
ahead when creating your campaign to account for this 
change. As the characters make a greater impact on the 
world, they face greater danger whether they want to 
or not. Powerful factions see them as a threat and plot 
against them, while friendly ones court their favor in 
hopes of striking a useful alliance. 
The tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for 
introducing new world-shaking events to the campaign. 
As the characters resolve one event, a new danger 
arises or the prior trouble transforms into a new threat 
in response to the characters' actions. Events.need to 
grow in magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and 
drama as the characters become increasingly powerful.
