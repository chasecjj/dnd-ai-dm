IMPROVISING DAMAGE 
A monster or effect typically specifies the amount of 
damage it deals. In some cases, though, you need to 
determine damage on the fly. The Improvising Damage 
table gives you suggestions for when you do so.

Examples 
Burned by coals, hit by a falling bookcase, pricked 
by a poison needle 
Being struck by lightning, stumbling into a fire pit 
Hit by falling rubble in a collapsing tunnel, 
stumbling into a vat of acid 
Crushed by compacti ng walls, hit by whirling steel 
blades, wading through a lava stream 
18d10 
Being submerged in lava, being hit by a crashing 
flying fortress 
24d10 
Tumbling into a vortex of fire on the Elemental 
Plane of Fire, being crushed in the jaws of a godlike 
creature or a moon-sized monster 
The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to 
how deadly these damage numbers are for characters 
of various levels. Cross-reference a character's level 
with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of 
the damage.

Damage sufficient to cause a setback rarely poses 
a risk of death to characters of the level shown, but 
a severely weakened character might be laid low by 
this damage.

In contrast, dangerous damage values pose a 
significant threat to weaker characters and could 
potentially kill a character of the level shown if that 
character is missing many hit points. 
As the name suggests, deadly damage is enough 
to drop a character of the level shown to 0 hit points. 
This level of damage can kill even powerful characters 
outright if they are already wounded. 
ADJUDICATING AREAS OF EFFECT 
Many spells and other game features create areas of 
effect, such as the cone and the sphere. If you're not 
using miniatures or another visual aid, it can sometimes 
be difficult to determine who's in an area of effect and 
who isn't. The easiest way to address such uncertainty 
is to go with your gut and make a call. 
If you would like more guidance, consider using 
the Targets in Areas of Effect table. To use the table, 
imagine which combatants are near one another, and 
let the table guide you in determining the number of 
those combatants that are caught in an area of effect. 
Add or subtract targets based on how bunched up the 
potential targets are. Consider rolling 1d3 to determine 
the amount to add or subtract.

For example, if a wizard directs burning hands (a 
15-foot cone) at a nearby group of orcs, you could use 
the table and say that two orcs are targeted (15 + 10 
= 1.5, rounded up to 2). Similarly, a sorcerer could
