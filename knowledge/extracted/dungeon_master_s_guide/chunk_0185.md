style, consider using inspiration as a reward when 
the characters achieve an important goal or victory, 
representing a surge of confidence and energy. 
Under this model, give everyone in the party 
inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a 
powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a 
goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in 
the campaign. 
Genre Emulation. Inspiration is a handy tool for 
reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. 
Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as 
personality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any 
of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired 
by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: 
"I can't resist helping a person I find alluring despite 
warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble." If the 
characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive 
noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue 
and betrayal, reward them with inspiration. 
Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can't 
help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its 
secrets. They probably also go off alone when they 
shouldn't. If the party splits up, consid~r giving each 
character inspiration. 
A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues 
and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, 
we're not dealing with sensible people; we're dealing 
with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this 
approach to work, create a list of your genre's main 
conventions and share it with your players. Before the 
campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your 
group is on board for embracing those conventions. 
Players and Inspiration. Remember that a player 
with inspiration can award it to another player. Some 
groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, 
deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's 
best to let players award their inspiration as they see 
fit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain 
guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce 
conventions of a certain genre. 
W HEN Do You AwARD INSPIRATION? 
Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some 
DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. 
Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering 
inspiration while a player is considering options. Both 
approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. 
Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of 
play, but it also means players don't know whether their 
decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the 
player can't spend the inspiration on the act that earned 
it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it 
or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This 
approach works best for groups that want to focus on 
immersion and player agency, where the DM steps 
back and gives the players more freedom to do what 
they want. 
Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration 
provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are 
manipulating the players or making choices for them. 
Offering inspiration before an action works great with 
groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre 
emulation and group storytelling, where character 
freedom isn't as important as weaving a compelling 
tale together. 
Start with awarding inspiration after an action, 
especially for your first campaign or when playing with 
a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the 
flow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you 
are being manipulative. 
TRACKING INSPIRATION 
A player typically notes on a character sheet whether 
he or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or 
some other token Alternatively, you can hand out special 
d20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends 
inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it 
back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to 
someone else, the d20 can go to that other person. 
IGNORING INSPIRATION 
Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some 
DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and 
others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts 
of the game are their own rewards that don't need 
incentives like inspiration. 
If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling the 
players that your campaign is one where you let the 
dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty 
campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an 
impartial role as a rules arbiter. 
VARIANT: ONLY PLAYERS AWARD INSPIRATION 
As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. 
Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget 
to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players 
to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every 
session, each player can award inspiration to another 
player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group 
has agreed on for awarding inspiration. 
This approach makes your life easier and also gives 
players the chance to recognize each other for good 
play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being 
awarded fairly. 
This approach works best with groups that are 
focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely 
manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, 
without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying 
or whatever other criteria the group has established. 
In this variant, you can allow each player to award 
inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the 
first time that a player awards inspiration in a session 
is free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same 
es ion. you gain inspiration that you can spend to give 
advantage to any foe of the player characters. There's 
no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in 
this way. and unspent inspiration carries over from one 
session to the next.
