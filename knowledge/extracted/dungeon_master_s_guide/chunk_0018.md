anyone who can afford them. People purchase tickets to 
ride airships and trains propelled by elemental magic. 
Consider these questions -when fitting magic into 
your world: 
Is some magic common? Is some socially 
unacceptable? Which magic is rare? 
How unusual are members of each spellcasting 
class? How common are those who can cast high-
level spells? 
How rare are magic items, magical locations, 
and creatures that have supernatural powers? At 
what power level do these things go from everyday 
to exotic? 
How do authorities regulate and use magic? How 
do normal folks use magic and protect them-
selves from it? 
The answers to some questions suggest the answers 
to others. For example, if spell casters of low-level 
spells are common, as in Eberron, then authorities and 
common folk are more likely to have access to and use 
the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic 
isn't only possible, but also less expensive. People are 
more likely to keep well-known magic in mind, and to 
protect against it, especially in risky situations. 
RESTRICTIONS ON MAGIC 
Some civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use 
of magic. Spellcasting might be forbidden without a 
license or official permission. In such a place, magic 
items and continual magical effects are rare, with 
protections against magic being the exception. 
Some localities might prohibit specific spells. It could 
be a crime to cast any spells used to steal or swindle, 
such as those that bestow invisibility or produce 
illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate others 
are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of 
free will. Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for 
obvious reasons. A local ruler could have a phobia about 
a specific effect or spell (such as shapeshifting effects if 
he or she were afraid of being impersonated) and enact 
a law restricting that type of magic. 
SCHOOLS OF MAGIC 
The rules of the game refer to the schools of magic 
(abjuration, illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it's 
up to you to determine what those schools signify in 
your world. Similarly, a few class options suggest the 
existence of magic-using organizations in the world-
bardic colleges and druid circles- which are up to you to 
flesh out. 
· 
You could decide that no formal structures like these 
exist in your world. Wizards (and bards and druids) 
might be so rare that a player character learns from a 
single mentor and never meets another character of the 
same class, in which case wizards would learn their 
school specialization without any formal training. 
However, if magic is more common, academies can 
be the embodiments of the schools of magic. These 
institutions have their own hierarchies, traditions, 
regulations, and procedures. For example, Materros 
the necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
Cabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within 
its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green 
robes of a master. Of course, when he wears these 
robes, his occupation is easily identified by those who 
know of the cabal. This recognition could be a boon or 
a nuisance, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome 
reputation. 
If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, 
bardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations, 
using the guidelines for organizations presented earlier 
in this chapter. A player character necromancer might 
cultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while 
a bard seeks increasing renown within the College of 
Mac-Fuirmidh. 
TELEPORTATION CIRCLES 
The presence of permanent teleportation circles in 
major cities helps cement their important place in the 
economy of a fantasy world. Spells such as plane shift, 
teleport, and teleportation circle connect with these 
circles, which are found in temples, academies, the 
headquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent 
civic locations. However, since every teleportation circle 
is a possible means of entry into a city, they're guarded 
by military and magical protection. 
As you design a fantasy city, think about the 
teleportation circles it might contain and which ones 
adventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers 
commonly return to their home base by means of 
a teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for 
plot developments in your campaign. What do the 
adventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and 
find all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying 
in pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an 
.argument between two feuding priests at the temple? 
Adventure ensues! 
BRINGING BACK THE DEAD 
When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves 
the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, 
and goes to abide on the plane where the creature's 
deity resides. If the creature didn't worship a deity, its 
soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. 
Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving 
the soul from that plane and returning it to its body. 
Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for 
a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping 
the body prevents others from using raise dead or 
resurrection to restore the slain character to life. 
A soul can't be returned to life if it doesn't wish to 
be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron 
deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and 
might refuse to return on that basis. For example, if 
the honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a 
high priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs 
his body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the 
dead by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him 
automatically fail. If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm 
to interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick 
his soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising him 
and then capturing him once he is alive again.
