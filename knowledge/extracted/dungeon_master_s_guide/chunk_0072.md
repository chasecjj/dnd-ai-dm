contacts for beginning adventurers, and characters are 
likely to secure more helpful contacts over the course of 
their adventuring careers. 
A name and a few choice details are all you need 
for casual contacts, but take the time to flesh out a 
recurring contact, especially one who might become an 
ally or enemy at some point. At the very least, give some 
thought to a contact's goals and how those goals are 
likely to come into play. 
PATRONS 
A patron is a contact who employs the adventurers, 
providing help or rewards as well as quests and 
adventure hooks. Most of the time, a patron has a vested 
interest in the adventurers' success and doesn't need to 
be persuaded to help them. 
A patron might be a retired adventurer who seeks 
younger heroes to deal with rising threats, or a mayor 
who knows that the town guard can't handle a dragon 
demanding tribute. A sheriff becomes a patron by 
offering a bounty for kobold raiders terrorizing the local 
countryside, as does a noble who wants an abandoned 
estate cleared of monsters. 
HIRELINGS 
Adventurers can pay NPCs to provide services 
in a variety of circumstances. Information on 
hirelings appears in chapter 5, "Equipment," of the 
Player's Handbook. 
Hireling NPCs rarely become important in an 
adventure, and most require little development. When 
adventurers hire a coach to carry them across town 
or need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger 
is a hireling, and the adventurers might never even 
converse with that NPC or learn his or her name. A 
ship captain carrying the adventurers across the sea is 
also a hireling, but such a character has the potential 
to turn into an ally, a patron, or even an enemy as the 
adventure unfolds. 
When the adventurers hire an NPC for long-term 
work, add the cost of that NPC's services to the 
characters' lifestyle expenses. See the "Additional 
Expenses" section of chapter 6, "Between Adventures," 
for more information. 
ExTRAS 
Extras are the characters and creatures in the 
background that the main characters rarely, if ever, 
interact with. 
Extras might be elevated to more important roles by 
virtue of adventurers singling them out. For instance, a 
player might be hooked by a passing reference you make 
to a street urchin and try to strike up a conversation 
with the youngster. Suddenly, an extra on whom you 
placed no importance becomes a central figure in an 
improvised roleplaying scene. 
Whenever extras are present, be prepared to come up 
with names and mannerisms on the fly. In a pinch, you 
can plunder the race-specific character names found in 
chapter 2, "Races," of the Player's Handbook.
