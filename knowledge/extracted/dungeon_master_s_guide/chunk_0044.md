item for sale, though the price might wei! be more than 
gold. The efreet are fond of trading in favors, especially 
when they have the upper hand in negotiations. Perhap 
a magical disease or poison can be cured only with 
something that must be purchased in the bazaars 
of the city. 
The heart of the city is the towering Charcoal 
Palace, where the tyrannical sultan of the efreet reigns 
supreme, surrounded by efreet nobles and a host of 
slaves, guardians, and sycophants. 
PLANE OF WATER 
The nature of water is to flow, not like the gusting wind 
or the leaping flame, but smoothly and steadily. It is the 
rhythm of the tide, the nectar of life, the bitter tears of 
mourning, and the balm of sympathy and healing. Given 
time, it can erode all in its path. 
A warm sun arcs across the sky of the Plane of 
Water, seeming to rise and set from within the water 
at the visible edge of the horizon. Several times a day, 
however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge 
of rain, often accompanied by spectacular shows of 
lightning, before clearing up again. At night, a glittering 
array of stars and auroras bedecks the sky. 
The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the Sea 
of Worlds, dotted here and there with atolls and islands 
that rise up from enormous coral reefs that seem to 
stretch forever into the depths. The storms that move 
across the sea sometimes create temporary portals 
to the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane 
of Water. Surviving vessels from countless worlds 
and navies ply these waters with little hope of ever 
returning home. 
The weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes. 
If the sea isn't calm, it is battered by storms. On rare 
oc.casions, a tremor in the planar firmament sends a 
rogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping entire 
islands and driving ships down to the reefs. 
Life flourishes in the upper reaches of the Sea of 
Worlds, called the Sea of Light because of the sunlight 
filtering down into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft 
castles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The marids 
are the distant stewards of this region, content to allow 
the lesser folk to compete for territory. The nominal 
emperor of the marids dwells in the Citadel ofTen 
Thousand Pearls, an opulent palace made of coral and 
studded with pearls. 
The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight 
reaches, are called the Darkened Depths. Horrid 
creatures dwell here, and the absolute cold and crushing 
pressure mean a swift end to creatures accustomed 
to the surface or the Sea of Light. Krakens and other 
mighty leviathans claim this realm. 
Any land that rises above the surface of the sea is 
hotly contested by the few air-breathers that live on the 
plane. Fleets of rafts and ships lashed together serve 
as solid ground where nothing else is available. Most 
natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea 
and thus ignore these habitations. 
One of the few actual islands on the plane is the Isle 
of Dread. The island is connected to the Material Plane 
by means of a regular storm that sweeps over the island.
