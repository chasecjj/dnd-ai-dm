HAPTER 2: CREATING A MULTIVERSE 
l
HEN ADVENTURERS REACH HIGHER LEVELS , 
their path extends to other dimensions of 
reality: the planes of existence that form the 
multiverse. The characters might be called 
on to rescue a friend from the horrific depths 
of the Abyss or to sail the shining waters of 
the River Oceanus. They can hoist a tankard 
- lhe friendly giants ofYsgard or face the chaos of 
-bo to contact a wizened githzerai sage. 
::>Janes of existence define the extremes of strange 
- often dangerous environments. The most bizarre 
··ons present settings undreamed of in the natural 
d. Planar adventures offer unprecedented dangers 
- . ·onders. Adventurers walk on streets made of solid 
or test their mettle on a battlefield where the fallen 
;-e urrected with each dawn. 
: :arious planes of existence are realms of myth 
mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but 
-ensions formed and governed by spiritual and 
~ ental principles. 
-
e Outer Planes are realms of spirituality and 
ght. They are the spheres where celestials, fiends, 
-
deities exist. The plane of Elysium, for example, 
-merely a place where good creatures dwell, and not 
imply the place where spirits of good creatures 
. hen they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual 
where evil can't flourish. It is as much a state of 
-
a and of mind as it is a physical location. 
e Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence 
- elemental nature of air, earth, fire, and water.

Elemental Plane of Fire, for example, embodies 
~ e ence of fire. The plane's entire substance is 
= ed with the fundamental nature of fire: energy, 
--·on, transformation, and destruction. Even objects 
: lid brass or basalt seem to dance with flame, in a 
ilile and palpable manifestation of the vibrancy of 
· dominion. 
- lhis context, the Material Plane is the nexus where 
· ese philosophical and elemental forces collide in 
:umbled existence of mortal life and matter. The 
- d of D&D exist within the Material Plane, making 
e starting point for most campaigns and adventures. 
- -e rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the 
.,-erial Plane. 
l: ..... A.NAR CATEGORIES 
- -e planes of the default D&D cosmology are grouped 
- -:he following categories: 
e Material Plane and Its Echoes. The Feywild and 
·· e Shadowfell are reflections of the Material Plane. 
e Transitive Planes. The Ethereal Plane and the 
. · tral Plane are mostly featureless planes that 
: rve primarily as pathways to travel from one plane 
•o another. 
The Inner Planes. The four Elemental Planes (Air, 
Earth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that 
surrounds them, are the Inner Planes. 
The Outer Planes. Sixteen Outer Planes correspond 
to the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of 
philosophical difference between them. 
The Positive and Negative Planes. These two planes 
enfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw 
forces of life and death that underlie the rest of 
existence in the multiverse. 
PUTTING THE PLANES TOGETHER 
As described in the Player's Handbook, the assumed 
D&D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. 
For your campaign, you decide what planes to include, 
inspired by the standard planes, drawn from Earth's 
myths, or created by your own imagination. 
At minimum, most D&D campaigns require 
these elements: 
• A plane of origin for fiends 
A plane of origin for celestials 
A plane of origin for elementals 
• A place for deities, which might include any or all of 
the previous three 
The place where mortal spirits go after death, which 
might include any or all of the first three 
A way of getting from one plane to another 
A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral 
Plane and the Ethereal Plane to function 
Once you've decided on the planes you want to use in 
your campaign, putting them into a coherent cosmology 
is an optional step. Since the primary way of traveling 
from plane to plane, even using the Transitive Planes, 
is through magical portals that link planes together, the 
exact relationship of different planes to one another is 
largely a theoretical concern. No being in the multiverse 
can look down and see the planes in their arrangement 
the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No 
mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched 
between Bytopia and Arcadia, but it's a convenient 
theoretical construct based on the philosophical 
shading among the three planes and the relative 
importance they give to law and good. 
Sages have constructed a few such theoretical models 
to make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly the 
Outer Planes. The three most common are the Great 
INVENTING YOUR OWN PLANES 
Each of the planes described in this chapter has at least 
one significant effect on travelers who venture there. When 
you design your own planes, it's a good idea to stick to 
that model. Create one simple trait that players notice, that 
doesn't create too much complication at the gaming table, 
and that's easy to remember. Try to reflect the philosophy and 
mood of the place, not merely its physical characteristics.
