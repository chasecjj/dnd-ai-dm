CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
ARMOR OF VULNERABILITY 
Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one 
of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, 
or slashing. The DM chooses the type or determines 
it randomly. 
Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed 
only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you 
attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you 
are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic: 
removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed 
you have vulnerability to two of the three damage type 
associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants 
resistance). 
ARROW-CATCHING SHIELD 
Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement) 
You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while 
you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the 
shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an 
attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 
5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the 
target of the attack instead. 
ARROW OF SLAYING 
Weapon (arrow), very rare 
An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay 
a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused 
than others; for example, there are both arrows of 
dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a 
creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated 
with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, 
the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving 
throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed 
save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one. 
Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a 
creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow. 
Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, 
such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though 
arrows are most common. 
BAG OF BEANS 
Wondrous item, rare 
Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The 
bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean 
it contains. 
If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they 
explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. 
Each creature in the area, including you, must make a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage 
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that 
aren't being worn or carried. 
If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or 
sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 
1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. 
The DM can choose an effect from the following table, 
determine it randomly, or create an effect.
