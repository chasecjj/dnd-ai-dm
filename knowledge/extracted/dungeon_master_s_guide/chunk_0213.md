I, 
Don't worry if the damage output isn't matching up 
with the expected challenge rating for the monster. 
Other factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, 
as will be discussed in later steps, and you can always 
adjust a monster's damage output later on. 
Some monsters use natural weapons, such as claws 
or tail spikes. Others wield manufactured weapons. 
If a monster has natural weapons, you decide how 
much damage it deals with those attacks, as well as the 
type of damage. See the Monster Manual for examples. 
If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, it deals 
damage appropriate to the weapon. For example, a 
greataxe in the hands of a Medium monster deals ld12 
slashing damage plus the monster's Strength modifier, 
as is normal for that weapon. 
Big monsters typically wield oversized weapons that 
deal extra dice of damage on a hit. Double the weapon 
dice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it's 
Huge, and quadruple the weapon dice if it's Gargantuan. 
For example, a Huge giant wielding an appropriately 
sized greataxe deals 3dl2 slashing damage (plus its 
Strength bonus), instead of the normalldl2. 
A creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a 
weapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule 
that a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes 
larger is too big for the creature to use at all. 
Overall Damage Output. To determine a monster's 
overall damage output, take the average damage it 
deals with each of its attacks in a round and add them 
together. If a monster has different attack options, use 
the monster's most effective attacks to determine its 
damage output. For example, a fire giant can make two 
greatsword attacks or one rock attack in a round. The 
greatsword attacks deal more damage, so that attack 
routine determines the fire giant's damage output. 
If a monster's damage output varies from round to 
round, calculate its damage output each round for the 
first three rounds of combat, and take the average. 
For example, a young white dragon has a multiattack 
routine (one bite attack and two claw attacks) that deals 
an average of 37 damage each round, as well as a breath 
weapon that deals 45 damage, or 90 if it hits two targets 
(and it probably will). In the first three rounds of combat, 
the dragon will probably get to use its breath weapon 
once and its multiattack routine twice, so its average 
damage output for the first three rounds would be (90 + 
37 + 37) + 3, or 54 damage (rounded down). 
When calculating a monster's damage output, also 
account for special off-turn damage-dealing features, 
such as auras, reactions, legendary actions, or lair 
ATTACK RIDERS 
Many monsters have attacks that do more than deal damage. 
Some effects that can be added to an attack to give it a 
flavorful twist include: 
• Adding damage of a different type to the attack 
• Having the monster grapple the target on a hit 
• Allowing the monster to knock the target prone on a hit 
• Imposing a condition on the target if the attack hits and 
the target fails a saving throw

actions. For example, a balor's Fire Aura deals 10 
fire damage to any creature that hits the balor with a 
melee attack. The aura also deals 10 fire damage to all 
creatures within 5 feet of the balor at the start of each 
of the balor's turns. If you assume that one character ~ 
the party is within 5 feet of the balor at all times, hittir::; 
it with a melee weapon every round, then the balor's 
damage output per round increases by 20. 
STEP 12. SAVE DCs 
A monster might have an attack or some other trait 
that requires a target to make a saving throw. The sa,·e 
DCs to resist such effects have a direct bearing on the 
monster's challenge rating, and vice versa. You can 
determine save DCs in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 
expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an 
appropriate save DC for any effect that requires a tar e· 
to make a saving throw. 
Calculate the DCs. Alternatively, you can calculate 
a monster's save DCs as follows: 8 + the monster's 
proficiency bonus + the monster's relevant ability 
modifier. You choose the ability that best applies. 
For example, if the effect is a poison, the relevant 
ability is probably the monster's Constitution. If 
the effect is similar to that of a spell, the relevant 
ability might be the monster's Intelligence, Wisdom, 
or Charisma. 
Don't worry if the save DCs aren't matching up with 
the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other 
factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, as 
shown in later steps, and you can always adjust the sa -
DCs later on. 
STEP 13. SPECIAL TRAITS , ACTIONS, AND 
REACTIONS 
Some special traits (such as Magic Resistance), specia:. 
actions (such as· Superior Invisibility), and special 
reactions (such as Parry) can improve a monster's 
combat effectiveness and potentially increase its 
challenge rating.
