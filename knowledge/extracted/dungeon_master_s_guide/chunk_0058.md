VAMPIRE VILLAIN 
Growing Corruption. As time passes, the villain's 
power and influence grow, affecting more victims 
across a larger area. This might take the form of armies 
conquering new territory, an evil cult recruiting new 
members, or a spreading plague. A pretender to the 
throne might attempt to secure the support of the 
kingdom's nobility in the days or weeks leading up to a 
coup, or a guild leader could corrupt the members of a 
town council or bribe officers of the watch. 
One and Done. The villain commits a single crime 
and then tries to avoid the consequences. Instead of an

ongoing plan to commit more crimes, the villain's goal is 
to lie low or flee the scene. 
Serial Crimes. The villain commits crimes one after 
the other, but these acts are repetitive in nature, rather 
than escalating to greater heights of depravity. The 
trick to catching such a villain lies in determining the 
pattern underlying the crimes. Though serial killers are 
a common example of this type of villain, your villain 
could be a serial arsonist favoring a certain type of 
building, a magical sickness that affects spellcasters 
who cast a specific spell, a thief that targets a certain 
kind of merchant, or a doppelganger kidnapping and 
impersonating one noble after another. 
Step by Step. In pursuit of its goal, the villain carries 
out a specific set of actions in a particular sequence. 
A wizard might steal the items needed to create a 
phylactery and become a lich, or a cultist might kidnap 
the priests of seven good-aligned gods as a sacrifice. 
Alternatively, the villain could be following a trail to find 
the object of its revenge, killing one victim after another 
while moving ever closer to the real target. 
3. DETERMINE THE PARTY'S GOALS 
You can use the Event-Based Goals table to set the 
party's goal. A goal can also suggest ways in which the 
adventurers become caught up in the villain's plans, and 
what exactly they must do to foil those plans.

20 
Roll twice, ignoring results of 20. 
For example, you roll a 10 on the table, indicating that 
the party's goal is to secure aid from a ruler or council. 
You decide to connect that to the leadership of the order 
targeted by your vampire villain. Maybe the order's 
leaders have a chest of jewels stolen from the vampire 
centuries ago, and the characters can use the chest as 
bait to trap the villain.
