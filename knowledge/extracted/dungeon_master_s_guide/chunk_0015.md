from that spoken in the neighboring kingdom. This 
might make communication (and diplomacy) between 
rwo kingdoms significantly more difficult. 
Widely used languages might have ancient versions, 
or there might be completely different ancient tongues 
that adventurers find written in tombs and ruins. Such 
languages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions 
and tomes that characters encounter. 
You might invent additional secret languages, besides 
Druidic and thieves' cant, that allow members of certain 
organizations or political affiliations to communicate. 
You could even decide that each alignment has its 
own language, which might be more of an argot used 
primarily to discuss philosophical concepts. 
In a region where one race has subjugated another, 
the language of the conquerors can become a mark of 
ocial status. Similarly, reading and writing might be 
restricted by law to the upper classes of a society. 
FACTIONS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS 
Temples, guilds, orders, secret societies, and 
colleges are important for.ces in the social order of 
any civilization. Their influence might stretch across 
multiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly 
wide-ranging political authority. Organizations can 
play an important part in the Jives of player characters, 
becoming their patrons, allies, or enemies just like 
individual non player characters. When characters join 
these organizations, they become part of something 
larger than themselves, which can give their adventures 
a context in the wider world. 
ADVENTURERS AND ORGANIZATIONS 
At the start of a campaign, backgrounds are a great 
way to connect adventurers to your world. As the game 
progresses, though, background ties often become less 
important. 
Factions and organizations aimed at player characters 
are a way to keep higher-level adventurers connected 
m your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear 
agenda beyond individual gain. In the same way, 
Yillainous organizations create an ongoing sense of 
menace above and beyond the threat of solitary foes. 
Having different characters tied to different factions 
can create interesting situations at the gaming table, as 
long as those factions have similar goals and don't work 
in opposition to one another all the time. Adventurers 
representing different factions might have competing 
interests or priorities while they pursue the same goals. 
Adventurer organizations are also a great source of 
special rewards beyond experience points and treasure. 
Increased standing in an organization has value in and 
of itself, and might also come with concrete benefits 
such as access to an organization's information, 
equipment, magic, and other resources. 
CREATING FACTIONS 
Factions and organizations that you create for your 
campaign should grow out of the stories that are 
important to the world. Create organizations that your 
players will want to interact with, whether as allies, 
members, or enemies. 
As a starting point, decide what role you want an 
organization to play in the world. What is it all about? 
What are its goals? Who founded it and why? What do 
its members do? Answering these questions should 
SAMPLE FACTION: THE HARPERS 
The Harpers is a scattered network of spellcasters and spies 
who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of 
power, magical or otherwise. 
The organization has risen, been shattered, and risen 
again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely 
due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the 
autonomy of its various members. The Harpers have small 
cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms, 
although they interact and share information with one 
another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers' 
ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their 
ingenuity and incorruptibility. Harpers don't seek power or 
glory, only fair and equal treatment for all . 
Motto. "Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all." 
Beliefs. The Harpers' beliefs can be summarized as follows: 
One can never have too much information or arcane 
knowledge. 
• Too much power leads to corruption, and the abuse of 
magic in particular must be closely monitored. 
No one should be powerless. 
Goals. Gather information throughout FaerCln, discern 
the political dynamics within each region, and promote 
fairness and equality by covert means. Act openly as a last 
resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group 
that grows too powerful. Aid the weak, the poor, and the 
oppressed . 
Typical Quests. Typical Harper quests include securing 
an artifact that would upset the balance of power in a 
region, gathering information on a powerful individual or 
organization, and determining the true intentions of an 
ambitious political figur~ or evil spellcaster.
