At the other end of the plane. near the Frostfell (the 
plane of ice that borders the Plane of Water), is a region 
of frigid winds called the Mistral Reach. These gales 
drive snowstorms into the Frostfell and away from it, 
.toward the heart of the plane. Earth motes in the reach 
are covered with snow and ice. 
PLANE OF EARTH 
I Earth symbolizes stability, rigidity, stern resolve, and 
tradition. The plane's position opposite the Plane of 
Air in the ring of the Elemental Planes reflects its 
opposition to almost everything air represents. 
The Plane of Earth is a chain of mountains rising 
higher than any mountain range in the Material Plane. 
It has no sun of its own, and no air surrounds the peaks 
of its highest mountains. Most visitors to the plane 
arrive by way of caves and caverns that honeycomb the 
mountains. 
The largest cavern beneath the mountains, called 
the Great Dismal Delve or the Sevenfold Mazework, is 
home to the capital city of the dao, the City of jewels. 
The dao take great pride in their wealth and send teams 
of slaves across the plane in search of new veins of 
ore and gemstones to exploit. Thanks to their efforts, 
every building and significant object in the city is made 
from precious stones and metals, including the slender 
gemstone-inlaid spires that top most buildings. The city 
is protected by a powerful spell that alerts the entire dao 
population if a visitor steals even a single stone. Theft is 
punishable by death, with punishment extending to the 
thief's relatives. 
The mountains nearest the Fountains of Creation (on 
the Plane of Fire) are called the Furnaces. Lava seeps 
through their caverns, and the air reeks of sulfur. The 
dao have great forges and smelting furnaces here to 
process their ores and shape their precious metals. 
The border region between the planes of Water and 
Earth is a horrid swamp where twisted, gnarled trees 
and thick, stinging vines grow from the dense muck and 
slime. Here and there within the Swamp of Oblivion 
(also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and pools 
play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of 
mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden 
structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on 
platforms between trees, but a few stand on stilts driven 
deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud 
of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink 
down into it. 
It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of 
Oblivion can't be found again for at least a century. Now 
and then, a desperate soul casts an artifact of power into 
this place, removing it from the multiverse for a time. 
The promise of powerful magic lures adventurers to 
brave the monstrous insects and hags of the swamp in 
search of these treasures. 
The region of the plane nearest the Swamp of 
Oblivion is called the Mud Hills. Landslides constantly 
wear away the slopes of the hills, sending cascades 
of earth and stone into the bottomless swamp. The 
Plane of Earth seems to constantly regenerate the land, 
pushing new hills up as the old ones erode to nothing.
