KNow YouR PLAYERS 
The success of a D&D game hinges on your ability to 
entertain the other players at the game table. Whereas 
their role is to create characters (the protagonists of 
the campaign), breathe life into them, and help steer 
the campaign through their characters' actions, your 
role is to keep the players (and yourself) interested and 
immersed in the world you've created, and to let their 
characters do awesome things. 
Knowing what your players enjoy most about the 
D&D game helps you create and run adventures that 
they will enjoy and remember. Once you know which of 
the following activities each player in your group enjoys 
the most, you can tailor adventures that satisfy your 
players' preferences as much as possible, thus keeping 
them engaged.
