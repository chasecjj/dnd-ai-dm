CHAPTER 3: CREATING A DV ENTURES 
~ 
REATI G ADVENTURES IS ONE OF THE GREATEST 
rewards of being a Dungeon Master. It's a 
way to express yourself, designing fantastic 
locations and encounters with monsters, 
traps, puzzles, and conflicts. When you 
design an adventure, you call the shots. You 
o things exactly the way you want to. 
Fundamentally, adventures are stories. An adventure 
shares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an 
:ssue of a comic, or an episode of a TV show. Comic 
series and serialized TV dramas are particularly good 
comparisons, because of the way individual adventures 
are limited in scope but blend together to create a larger 
narrative. If an adventure is a single issue or episode, a 
campaign is the series as a whole. 
Whether you're creating your own adventures or using 
;JUblished adventures, you'll find advice in this chapter 
~o help you create a fun and memorable experience for 
:.·our players. 
Creating an adventure involves blending scenes of 
exploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified 
whole that meets the needs of your players and your 
campaign. But it's more than that. The basic elements 
of good storytelling should guide you throughout this 
;Jrocess, so your players experience the adventure as a 
- ory and not a disjointed series of encounters. 
ELEMENTS OF A 
GREAT ADVENTURE 
-=-he best adventures have several things in common. 
_-\_ C REDIBLE THREAT 
_-\n adventure needs a threat worthy of the heroes' 
c. rention. The threat might be a single villain or 
;:nonster, a villain with lackeys, an assortment of 
::::wnsters, or an evil organization. Whatever their 
arure, the antagonists should have goals that the 
:-:eroes can uncover and thwart. 
?.-\MILlAR TROPES WITH CLEVER TWISTS 
:-might seem stereotypical to build an adventure 
;;sound dragons, orcs, and insane wizards in towers, 
"Jut these are staples of fantasy storytelling. It might 
also seem trite to begin an adventure in a tavern, but 
~h at's an idea that remains true to D&D. Familiar 
srory elements are fine, as long as you and the players 
occasionally put a spin on them. For example, the 
:-nysterious figure who presents adventurers with 
a quest on behalf of the king might be the king in 
d.isguise. The crazy wizard in the tower might be a 
;Jrojected illusion created by a band of greedy gnome 
dlieves to guard their loot. 
_\ C LEAR Focus oN THE PRESENT 
.-ill adventure is about the here and now. A little bit 
of history might be needed to set the story in motion, 
and the adventurers might discover interesting lore of 
:.1e past in the course of the adventure. In general, let 
rhe world's history be evident in the present situation. 
Instead of dealing with what happened in the past, 
an adventure should focus on describing the present 
situation, what the bad guys are up to, and how the 
adventurers become involved in the story. 
HEROES WHO MATTER 
An adventure should allow the adventurers' actions and 
decisions to matter. Though it might resemble a novel 
or a TV episode, an adventure needs to allow for more 
than one outcome. Otherwise, players can feel as if 
they've been railroaded- set onto a course that has only 
one destination, no matter how hard they try to change 
it. For example, if a major villain shows up before the 
end of the adventure, the adventure should allow for the 
possibility that the heroes might defeat that villain. 
SoMETHING FOR ALL PLAYER TYPES 
As outlined in the book's introduction, players come 
to the gaming table with different expectations. An 
adventure needs to account for the different players and 
characters in your group, drawing them into the story as 
effectively as possible. 
As a starting point, think about your adventure in 
terms of the three basic types of activity in the game: 
exploration, social interaction, and combat. If your 
adventure includes a balance of all three, it's likely to 
appeal to all types of players. 
An adventure you create for your home campaign 
doesn't have to appeal to every abstract player type-
only to the players sitting down at your own table. If you 
don't have any players who like fighting above all else, 
then don't feel you have to provide a maximum amount 
of combat to keep the adventure moving. 
SURPRISES 
Look for opportunities to surprise and delight your 
players. For example, the exploration of a ruined castle 
on a hill might lead to the discovery of a dragon's tomb 
hidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness 
might lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only 
on nights of the full moon. Players remember such 
locations. 
Too many surprises can be off-putting to players, but 
adding the occasional twist gets players to adjust their 
tactics and think creatively. For example, you could 
spruce up a goblin lair by including goblin sappers 
with kegs of oil strapped to their backs. An attack on a 
villain's estate might be complicated by the unexpected 
arrival of a special guest. 
When preparing for possible combat encounters, 
think about odd pairings of monsters, such as a 
hobgoblin warlord and his pet manticore, or will-
o'-wisps in league with a young black dragon. Have 
surprise reinforcements show up, or give the monsters 
unusual tactics. Throw in the occasional red herring, 
deception, and plot twist to keep players on their toes, 
but try not to go overboard. Sometimes a simple, 
straightforward encounter with an ore guard is just as 
fun for your players.
