A character can bind sticks of dynamite together so 
they explode at the same time. Each additional stick 
increases the damage by 1d6 (to a maximum of 10d6) 
and the burst radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet). 
ALIEN TECHNOLOGY 
When adventurers find a piece of technology that isn't 
from their world or time period, the players might 
understand what the object is, but the characters 
rarely will. To simulate a character's ignorance about 
the technology, have the character make a series of 
Intelligence checks to figure it out. 
Dynamite can be rigged with a longer fuse to explode 
after a set amount of time, usually 1 to 6 rounds. Roll 
initiative for the dynamite. After the set number of 
rounds goes by, the dynamite explodes on that initiative. 
To determine how the technology works, a character 
must succeed on a number of Intelligence checks 
based on the complexity of the item: two successes for 
a simple item (such as a cigarette lighter, calculator, or 
revolver) and four successes for a complex item (such a 
a computer, chainsaw, or hovercraft). Then consult the 
Figuring Out Alien Technology table. Consider making 
the item break if a character fails four or more times 
before taking a long rest. 
GRENADES 
As an action, a character can throw a grenade at a 
point up to 60 feet away. With a grenade launcher, the 
character can propel the grenade up to 120 feet away. 
Each creature within 20 feet of an exploding 
fragmentation grenade must make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 5d6 piercing damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
One round after a smoke grenade lands, it emits a 
cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in 
a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per 
hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind 
(20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.
