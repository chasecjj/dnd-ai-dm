CHAPTER 6: BETWEEN ADVENTURES 
CAMPAIGN IS MUCH MORE THAN A SERIES OF 
adventures. It also includes the moments 
between them-the various distractions and 
side pursuits that engage the characters 
when they're not exploring the wilderness, 
plundering dungeons, and gallivanting 
around the multiverse on some epic quest. 
The natural pace of a campaign offers lulls between 
adventures, time for the characters to spend their 
treasure and pursue their goals. This downtime gives 
the characters an opportunity to sink their roots a little 
deeper into the world, building a personal investment 
in what happens to the people and places around them, 
which can, in turn, draw them into further adventures. 
Chapter 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook 
details the expenses that a character incurs for 
basic necessities, depending on the lifestyle the 
character chooses, from poverty to luxury. Chapter 
8, "Adventuring," of that book describes some of 
the downtime activities they can pursue between 
adventures. This chapter fills in the gaps, describing 
the expenses of owning property and hiring NPCs, and 
a variety of additional downtime activities characters 
can pursue. The beginning of the chapter also offers 
suggestions for linking adventures together and keeping 
track of events in your campaign. 
LINKING ADVENTURES 
A campaign in the style of an episodic television show 
rarely needs story links between its adventures. Each 
adventure features its own villains, and once the 
characters complete the adventure, there are typically 
no loose plot threads. The next adventure presents 
an altogether different challenge having nothing to do 
with the adventure that preceded it. As the characters 
gain experience points, they become more powerful, 
as do the threats they must overcome. This kind of 
campaign is easy to run, since it requires little effort 
beyond finding or creating adventures appropriate for 
the party's level. 
A campaign with a narrative lets the players feel as 
though their actions have far-reaching consequences. 
They're not just racking up experience points. A few 
simple modifications can help you overlay overarching 
elements to create a serialized campaign in which early 
adventures help set up later ones. 
USING AN 0VERARCHING STORY 
This section presents a couple of examples of 
overarching stories which have, over the years, fueled 
many classic D&D campaigns. 
The adventurers' goal in the first example is to amass 
the power they need to defeat a powerful enemy that 
threatens the world. Their goal in the second example 
is to defend something they care about by destroying 
whatever threatens it. The two examples are, in effect, 
the same story (variations of the battle between good 
and evil) told in different ways. 
EXAMPLE 1: THE QUEST OF MANY PARTS 
You can tie adventures together using an overarching 
goal that can be fulfilled only by first completing a series 
of related quests. For example, you could create a villain 
who can't be defeated until the characters explore nine 
dungeons in which the Nine Dread Princes reside, with 
each of these dungeons stocked with enough monsters 
and hazards to advance the adventurers two or three 
levels. The adventurers spend their whole careers 
fighting the Nine Dread Princes before finally pursuing 
an epic quest to destroy the princes' monstrous 
progenitor. As long as every dungeon is unique and 
interesting, your players will appreciate the tight focus 
of the campaign. 
In a similar type of quest campaign, the adventurers 
might need to collect fragments of an artifact that 
are scattered in ruins across the multi verse, before 
reassembling the artifact and using it to defeat a 
cosmic threat. 
ExAMPLE 2: AGENTS OF X 
You can also build a campaign around the idea that 
the adventurers are agents of something larger than 
themselves-a kingdom or secret organization, for 
example. Wherever their allegiance lies, the adventurers 
are motivated by loyalty and the goal of protecting 
whatever it is they serve. 
The characters' overarching mission might be to 
explore and map an uncharted region, forging alliances 
where they can and overcoming threats they encounter 
along the way. Their goal might be to find the ancient 
capital of a fallen empire, which lies beyond the realm 
of a known enemy and forces them to navigate hostile 
territory. The characters could be pilgrims in search 
of a holy site or members of a secret order dedicated 
to defending the last bastions of civilization in an ever-
declining world. Or they might be spies and assassins, 
striving to weaken an enemy country by targeting its evil 
leaders and plundering its treasures. 
PLANTING ADVENTURE SEEDS 
You can make a campaign feel like one story with many 
chapters by planting the seeds of the next adventure 
before the current one is finished. This technique can 
naturally moves the characters along to their next goal. 
If you've planted a seed well, the characters have 
something else to do when they finish an adventure. 
Perhaps a character drinks from a magic fountain in a 
dungeon and receives a mystifying vision that leads to 
the next quest. The party might find a cryptic map or 
relic that, once its meaning or purpose is determined, 
points to a new destination. Perhaps an NPC warns 
the characters of impending danger or implores 
them for help. 
The trick is to not distract the characters from the 
adventure at hand. Designing an effective hook for a 
future adventure requires finesse. The lure should be 
compelling, but not so irresistible that the players stop 
caring about what their characters are doing right now.
