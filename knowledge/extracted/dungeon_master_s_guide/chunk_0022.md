• Describe or name the creature that warned the 
populace about the oncoming disaster. Who listened? 
ho were the lucky (or unlucky) ones who survived? 
• Describe what the area looks like after the disaster, in 
contrast to how it looked before. 
~. ASSAULT OR INVASION 
ne of the most common world-shaking events, an 
Yasion occurs when one group forcibly takes over 
.another, usually by military strength, but also by 
.nfiltration and occupation. 
An assault differs from an invasion in that the 
acking force isn't necessarily interested in occupation 
r taking power. On the other hand, an assault might be 
e first step of an invasion. 
Regardless of the scale, a world-shaking assault or 
vasion stands out because its repercussions change 
e characters' world, and its effects echo long after the 
.nitial attack or takeover. 
Imagine that part of your campaign world is attacked 
r invaded. Depending on the current scale of your 
ampaign, the area might be as small as a section 
of a city or as large as a continent, world, or plane of 
existence. 
Define the aggressor and whether it represents a 
..mown enemy or a previously unknown adversary. 
-elect a threat that already poses a danger to the area 
_·ou've chosen, or use the Invading Forces table to 
determine the aggressor. 
I NVADI NG FoRCEs 
d8 
Invading Force 
A criminal enterprise 
2 
Monsters or a unique monster 
3 
A planar threat 
4 
A past adversary reawakened, reborn, or resurgent 
5 
A splinter faction 
6 
A savage tribe 
7 
A secret society 
8 
A traitorous ally 
Now consider these other aspects of the conflict: 
Name one element of the invasion or assault that the · 
defenders didn't expect or couldn't repel. 
Something happened to the first defenders who stood 
against the invasion or assault-something no one 
wants to talk about. What was it? 
• The attackers or invaders had a motive for their 
action that wasn't obvious or understood at first. 
What was it? 
• Who turned traitor, and at what point did they turn? 
Why did they do it? Did an attacker try to stop the 
incursion, or did a prominent defender throw in with 
the invaders? 
5. REBELLION, REVOLUTION, OVERTHROW 
Dissatisfied with the current order, a person or group 
of people overturns the dominant regime and takes 
over-or fails to take over. Regardless of the result, a 
revolution (even an attempted one) can shape the destiny 
of nations. 
The scale of a revolution need not involve the common 
masses against the nobility. A revolution can be as small 
as a merchants' guild revolting against its leadership 
or a temple overthrowing its priesthood in favor of a 
new creed. The spirits of the forest might attempt to 
overthrow the forces of civilization in a nearby city that 
cut down trees for timber. Alternatively, the scale can be 
as dramatic as humanity rising to overthrow the gods.

Imagine that part of your campaign world erupts in 
revolution. Pick a power group in your current campaign 
and name (or invent) a group that opposes it, fomenting 
revolution. Then let the following points help you flesh 
out the conflict: 
Name three things the rebels want or hope to achieve. 
• The rebels achieve a victory against those they wish 
to overthrow, even if it's a pyrrhic victory. Which of 
their three goals do they achieve? How long is this 
achievement likely to last? 
State the cost exacted upon the old order after its 
fall from power. Does anyone from the former power 
group remain in power during the next regime? If the 
old order remains in power, describe one way that its 
leaders punish the revolutionaries. 
• One of the rebellion's prominent leaders-in some 
respects the face of the revolution- was driven by a 
personal reason for his or her part in events. Describe 
this person and state the true reason he or she led the 
rebellion. 
• What problem existed before the revolution that 
persists in spite of it? 
6. EXTINCTION OR DEPLETION 
Something that once existed in the campaign world 
is gone. The lost resource might be a precious metal, 
a species of plant or animal that held an important 
place in the local ecology, or an entire race or culture of 
people. Its absence causes a chain reaction that affects 
every creature that uses or relies on it. 
You can eliminate a people, place, or thing that 
previously existed in a certain location or area in your 
campaign world. On a small scale, the last of a family 
. dynasty passes away or a once-thriving mining town 
in the region dries up and becomes a ghost town. On a 
grand scale, magic dies, the last dragon is slain, or the 
final fey noble departs the world. 
What is gone from the world-or the region of the 
world you've chosen- that once existed there? If the 
answer isn't immediately evident, consult the Extinction 
or Depletion table for ideas. 
EXTINCTION OR DEPLETION 
d8 
Lost Resource 
A kind of animal (insect, bird, fish, livestock) 
2 
Habitable land 
3 
Magic or magic-users (all magic, or specific kinds or 
schools of magic) 
4 
A mineral resource (gems, metals, ores) 
5 
A type of monster (unicorn, manticore, dragon) 
6 
A people (family line, clan, culture, race) 
7 
A kind of plant (crop, tree, herb, forest) 
8 
A waterway (river, lake, ocean) 
Then consider these additional questions: 
Name a territory, race, or type of creature that relied 
on the thing that was lost. How do they compensate? 
How do they attempt to substitute for what was lost?
