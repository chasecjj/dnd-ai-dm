The first step is to figure out what class feature or 
group of class features you're going to replace. Then 
you need to evaluate what each feature provides to the 
class, so that the features you are adding don't make the 
class over- or underpowered. Ask yourself the following 
questions about a feature you're replacing: 
What impact does replacing the feature have on 
exploration, social interaction, or combat? 
Does replacing the feature affect how long the party 
can continue adventuring in a day? 
Does the feature consume resources provided 
elsewhere in the class? 
Does the feature work all the time, or is it regained 
after a short rest, a long rest, or some other 
length of time? 
Armed with answers to these questions, you can start 
designing new features that replace the ones you are 
removing. It's fine if the new class features drift closer 
to exploration, social interaction, or combat than the 
ones you are replacing, but be wary of going too far. 
For example, if you replace an exploration-focused 
feature with something purely combat focused, you've 
just made that class more powerful in combat, and it 
could overshadow the other classes in a way that you 
didn't intend. 
There's no formula that can tell you how to design 
new class features. The best place to start is by looking 
at other class features, or at spells, feats, or any other 
rules for inspiration. You're almost certainly going to 
have some missteps, as features that seem good on the 
surface fall apart in play. That's all right. Everything 
you design will need to be playtested. When introducing 
new class features, be sure the players using them are 
comfortable with the fact that you might need to go back 
and make some changes after seeing them in play., 
CREATING NEW CLASS OPTIONS 
Each class has at least one major choice point. Clerics 
choose a divine domain, fighters choose a martial 
archetype, wizards choose an arcane tradition, and 
so forth. Creating a new option doesn't require you to 
remove anything from the class, but any new option 
you add should be compared to existing options to 
make sure it's no more or less powerful, yet remains 
distinctive in flavor. Like anything in class design, be 
prepared to playtest your ideas and make changes if 
things aren't playing out the way you want them to. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
Once you have the concept for the class option in 
mind, it's time to design the specifics. If you're not sure 
where to begin, look at the existing options and see w -
class features they provide. It's perfectly acceptable for 
two class options to have similar features, and it's al o 
fine to look at other classes for examples of mechanics 
you can draw on for inspiration. As you design each 
class feature, ask the following questions: 
How does the class feature reinforce the story or 
theme of the class option? 
Is there an existing feature that can be used 
as a model? 
How does the new class feature compare to other 
features of the same level? 
VARIANT: SPELL POINTS 
One way to modify how a class feels is to change how _ 
uses its spells. With this variant system, a character \ 
has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead 
spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more 
flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity. 
In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on - ~ 
level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cosr -
spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don·· 
require slots and therefore don't require spell points. 
Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast you;-
spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool 
of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell 
points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then us~ 
that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell po--
total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell poin -
when you finish a long rest. 
Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing-
cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each 
level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of · -
same level until you finish a long rest. 
The number of spell points you have to spend is ba 
on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell 
Points by Level table. Your level also determines the 
maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though 
you might have enough points to create a slot above this 
maximum, you can't do so. 
The Spell Points by Level table applies to bards, 
clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. For a paladin o~ 
ranger, halve the character's level in that class and the 
consult the table. For a fighter (Eidritch Knight) or ro 
(Arcane Trickster), divide the character's level in that 
class by three. 
This system can be applied to monsters that cast 
spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that 
you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a 
monster can be a hassle.
