when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. 
It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or 
dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. 
Personality. Every moonblade seeks the advancement 
of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, 
music, and life are all part of this purpose. 
The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to 
serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its 
ideals, its loyalty is absolute. 
If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once 
it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that 
person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of 
elven ideals. 
WAVE 
Weapon (trident), legendary (requires attunement by a 
creature that worships a god of the sea) 
Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this 
trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images 
of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must 
worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, Wave 
happily accepts new converts. 
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, 
the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its 
hit point maximum. 
The weapon also functions as a trident offish 
command and a weapon of warning. It can confer the 
benefit of a cap of water breathing while you hold it, and 
you can use it as a cube of force by choosing the effect, 
instead of pressing cube sides to select it. 
Sentience. Wave is a sentient weapon of neutral 
alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, 
and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out 
to a range of 120 feet. 
The weapon communicates telepathically with its 
wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It 
can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak 
with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder 
in the conversation. 
Personality. When it grows restless, Wave has a habit 
of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred 
hymns of the sea gods. 
Wave zealously desires to convert mortals to the 
worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the 
faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to 
further the weapon's objectives in the world. 
The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the 
place where it was forged, a desolate island called 
Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm 
giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of 
devotion to- or rebellion against-that god. 
Wave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and 
purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears 
that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's 
demise. This destiny is something Wave might not be 
able to avert. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
WHELM 
Weapon (warhammer), legendary (requires attunemenc 
by a dwarf) 
Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves 
and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain. 
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after 
you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop 
a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you 
remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have 
disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability 
checks while you can see the daytime sky. 
Thrown Weapon. Whelm has the thrown property, 
with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 
feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using 
it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or 
an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a gian-
Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your 
hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the 
weapon lands at your feet. 
Shock Wave. You can use an action to strike the 
ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from 
the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the 
ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. Once used, this property can't be used again 
until the next dawn. 
Supernatural Awareness. While you are holding 
the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or 
concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you 
can use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate 
object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you 
can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn. 
Sentience. Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon 
with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a 
Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 
The weapon communicates telepathically with its 
wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. 
Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish 
when used in combat. 
Personality. Whelm's purpose is to slaughter giants 
and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against 
all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy 
goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. 
Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, 
variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. 
It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything 
to protect those dwarves from harm. 
The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries 
ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for 
a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His 
will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil 
purposes, even killing members of his own clan.
