NECKLACE OF FIREBA LLS 
If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve 
extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror 
frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate 
the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an 
unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing 
away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures 
it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied 
spaces near it. 
While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an 
action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or 
call out a particular cell by number. The creature named 
or contained in the named cell appears as an image 
on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then 
communicate normally. 
In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a 
second command word and free one creature trapped 
in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with 
its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the 
mirror and facing away from it. 
MITHRAL ARMOR 
Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon 
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt 
or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. I£ the 
armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the 
mithral version of the armor doesn't. 
NECKLACE OF A DAPTATION 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally 
in any environment, and you have advantage on saving 
throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such 
as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, 
and the breath weapons of some dragons).

NECKLACE OF FIREBALLS 
Wondrous item, rare 
This necklace has ld6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You 
can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 6 
feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the 
bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15 
You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole 
necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the 
level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.

NECKLACE OF PRAYER B EADS 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, 
druid, or paladin) 
This necklace has ld4 + 2 magic beads made from 
aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many 
nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, 
bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a 
magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead 
loses its magic. 
Six types of magic beads exist. The DM decides the 
type of each bead on the necklace or determines it 
randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of 
the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the 
necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast 
from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a 
save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, 
that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.
