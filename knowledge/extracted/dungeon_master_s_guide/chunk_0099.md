MAGIC ITEMS 
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered 
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such 
items grant capabilities a character could rarely 
have otherwise, or they complement their owner's 
capabilities in wondrous ways. 
RARITY 
Each magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, 
rare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items, 
such as a potion of healing, are the most plentiful. Some 
legendary items, such as the apparatus of Kwalish, are 
unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating 
the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were 
then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and 
mishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily created. 
Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities. 
Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power 
relative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds 
to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity . 
table. A character doesn't typically find a rare magic 
item, for example, until around 5th level. That said, 
rarity shouldn't get in the way of your campaign's story. 
If you want a ring of invisibility to fall into the hands of 
a 1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will 
arise from that event. 
If your campaign allows for trade in magic items, 
rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the DM, 
you determine the value of an individual magic item 
based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in 
the Magic Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable 
item, such as a potion or scroll, is typically half the value 
of a permanent item of the same rarity. 
MAGIC ITEM RARITY 
Rarity 
Character Level 
Value 
Common 
1st or higher 
50-100 gp 
Uncommon 
1st or higher 
101-500 gp 
Rare 
5th or higher 
501 -5,000 gp 
Very rare 
11th or higher 
5,001 - 50,000 gp 
Legendary 
17th or higher 
50,001+ gp 
BUYING AND SELLING 
Unless you decide your campaign works otherwise, 
most magic items are so rare that they aren't available 
for purchase. Common items, such as a potion of 
healing, can be procured from an alchemist, herbalist, 
or spellcaster. Doing so is rarely as simple as walking 
into a shop and selecting an item from a shelf. The seller 
might ask for a service, rather than coin. 
In a large city with an academy of magic or a major 
temple, buying and selling magic items might be 
possible, at your discretion. If your world includes a 
large number of adventurers engaged in retrieving 
ancient magic items, trade in these items might be more 
common. Even so, it's likely to remain similar to the 
market for fine art in the real world, with invitation-only 
auctions and a tendency to attract thieves. 
Selling magic items is difficult in most D&D worlds 
primarily because of the challenge of finding a buyer.
