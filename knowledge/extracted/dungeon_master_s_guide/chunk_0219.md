ExAMPLE SuBRACE: ELADRIN 
Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin 
live in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities 
sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing 
briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before 
fading back into the Feywild. 
The elf subraces in the Player's Handbook include 
an ability score increase, a weapon training feature, 
and two or three additional traits. Given the story of 
the eladrin and their magical nature, an increase to an 
eladrin character's Intelligence is appropriate. There's 
no need to alter the basic weapon training shared by 
high elves and wood elves. 
An ability that sets the eladrin apart from other elves 
is their ability to step through the boundary between the 
planes, disappearing for a moment before reappearing 
somewhere else. In the game, this is reflected in a 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
limited use of the misty step spell. Since misty step is 
a 2nd-level spell, this ability is potent enough that the 
subrace doesn't need additional traits. This leaves us 
with the following features for the eladrin subrace: 
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score 
increases by 1. 
Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the 
longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. 
Fey Step. You can cast the misty step spell once usin 
this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish 
a short or long rest. 
CREATING A NEW RACE 
When creating a race from scratch, begin with the 
story and proceed from there. Compare your creation 
to the other races of your world, and borrow freely 
from the traits of other races. As an example, consider 
the aasimar, a race similar to the tiefling but with a 
celestial heritage. 
EXAMPLE RACE: AASIMAR 
Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, 
aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These 
folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrou 
hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often 
attempt to pass as humans in order to right wrongs and 
defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawin 
undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive -
to fit into society, although they usually rise to the top, 
becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes. 
You might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoin· 
to the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odd 
reflecting some greater conflict between the forces of 
good and evil in your campaign. 
Here are our basic goals for the aasimar: 
• Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins. 
Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what 
tieflings are to fiends and humans. 
Given that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of 
the same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point 
for coming up with the new race's traits. Since we wam 
aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes 
sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead o: 
Intelligence and Charisma. 
Like tieflings, aasimar have darkvision. Instead of 
resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance 
to radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature. 
However, radiant damage isn't as common as fire 
damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage 
as well, making them good at facing undead. 
The tiefling's Infernal Legacy trait is a good model 
for a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage. 
replacing the tiefling's spells with spells of similar leveL 
that more closely match the aasimar's celestial ancestrY. 
However, the aasimar's expanded resistance might 
-
require limiting this trait to basic utility spells. 
Filling in the remaining details, we end up with the 
following racial traits for the aasimar: 
Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases 
by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.
