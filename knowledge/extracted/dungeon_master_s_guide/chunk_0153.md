STAFF OF THE PYTHON 
Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, 
or warlock) 
You can use an action to speak this staff's command 
word and throw the staff on the ground within 10 feet 
of you. The staff becomes a giant constrictor snake (see 
the Monster Manual for statistics) under your control 
and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus 
action to speak the command word again, you return the 
staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by 
the snake. 
On your turn, you can mentally command the snake 
if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. 
You decide what action the snake takes and where it 
moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general 
command, such as to attack your enemies or guard 
a location. 
If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and 
reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is 
destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing 
all its hit points, it regains all of them. 
STAFF OF THE WOODLANDS 
Staff, rare (requires attunement by a druid) 
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that 
grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell 
attack rolls. 
The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. 
It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. 
If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the 
staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical 
quarterstaff. 
Spells. You can use an action to expend 1 or more 
of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells 
from it, using your spell save DC: animal friendship (1 
charge), awaken (5 charges), barkskin (2 charges), locate 
animals or plants (2 charges), speak with animals (1 
charge), speak with plants (3 charges), or wall of thorns 
(6 charges). 
You can also use an action to cast the pass without 
trace spell from the staff without using any charges. 
Tree Form. You can use an action to plant one end 
of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to 
transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet 
tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at 
the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears 
ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation 
magic if targeted by detect magic. While touching the 
tree and using another action to speak its command, 
word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any 
creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff. 
STAFF OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING 
Staff, very rare (requires attunement) 
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that 
grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
it. It also has the following additional properties. When 
one of these properties is used, it can't be used again 
until the next dawn.
