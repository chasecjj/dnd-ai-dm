on a different plane, so it can't be u ed to create open 
passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can 
exit the hole by climbing out of it. 
You can use an action to close a portable hole by 
taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. 
Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or 
objects within remain in the extradimensional space. o 
matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing. 
If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's 
extradimensional space can use an action to make 
a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the 
creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of 
the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing 
creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up 
to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. 
Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional 
space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy 
haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items 
and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it 
and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. 
The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't 
be reopened. 
POTION OF ANIMAL FRIENDSHIP 
Potion, uncommon 
When you drink this potion, you can cast the animal 
friendship spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating 
this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, 
a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair. 
POTION OF CLAIRVOYANCE 
Potion, rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the 
clairvoyance spell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish 
liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened. 
POTION OF CLIMBING 
Potion, common 
When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed 
equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this 
rime, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks 
you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, 
silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. 
Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors. 
POTION OF DIMINUTION 
Potion, rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" 
effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no 
concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid 
continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands 
to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle 
fails to interrupt this process. 
POTION OF FIRE BREATH 
Potion, uncommon 
After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to 
exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target 
must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 
lire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on 
a successful one. The effect t;nds after you exhale the 
lire three times or when 1 hour has passed. 
This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the 
top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened. 
POTION OF FLYING 
Potion, very rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed 
equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. 
If you're in the air when the potion wears off, you fall 
unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This 
potion's clear liquid floats at the top of its container and 
has cloudy white impurities drifting in it. 
POTION OF GASEOUS FORM 
Potion, rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of 
the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration 
required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. 
This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves 
and pours like water. 
POTION OF GIANT STRENGTH 
Potion, rarity varies 
When you drink this potion, your Strength score 
changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the 
score (see the table below). The potion has no effect 
on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than 
that score. 
This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a 
sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. 
The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone 
giant strength have the same effect.

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" 
effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no 
concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid 
continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear 
liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle 
fails to interrupt this process. 
POTION OF HEALING 
Potion, rarity varies 
You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The 
number of hit points depends on the potion's rarity, as 
shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its 
potency, the potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.
