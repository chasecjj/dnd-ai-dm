WILDERNESS 
Between the dungeons and settlements of your 
campaign world lie meadows, forests, deserts, mountain 
ranges, oceans, and other tracts of wilderness waiting 
to be traversed. Bringing wilderness areas to life can be 
a fun part of your game, both for you and your players. 
The following two approaches work particularly well. 
TRAVEL- MONTAGE APPROACH 
Sometimes the destination is more important than the 
journey. If the purpose of a wilderness trek is to get 
the characters to where the real adventure happens, 
gloss over the wilderness trek without checking for 
encounters along the way. Just as movies use travel 
montages to convey long and arduous journeys in a 
matter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of 
descriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in 
your players' minds before moving on. 
Describe the journey as vividly as you like, but keep 
the forward momentum. "You walk for several miles 
and encounter nothing of interest" is okay, but far less 
evocative and memorable than, "A light rain dampens 
the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, 
you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue 
finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but 
otherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary." 
The trick is to focus on a few details that reinforce the 
desired mood rather than describe everything down to 
the last blade of grass. 
Call attention to unusual terrain features: a waterfall, 
a rocky outcropping that offers a breathtaking view over 
the tops of the surrounding trees, an area where the 
forest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also 
describe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of 
a faraway monster, the stench of burned wood, or the 
sweet aroma of flowers in an elven forest. 
In addition to evocative language, visual aids can help 
set the scene for the characters' travels. Image searches 
on the Internet can lead you to breathtaking landscapes 
(in fact, that's a good phrase to search for) both real and 
fantastical. As striking as real-world scenery can be, 
wilderness travel can be used to remind the players that 
their characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while, 
spice up your descriptions with some truly magical 
element. A forest might be home to tiny dragonets 
instead of birds, or its trees might be festooned with 
giant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these 
elements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can 
break your players' sense of immersion in the world. A 
single fantastic element within an otherwise realistic 
and memorable landscape is enough. 
Use the landscape to set the mood and tone for your 
adventure. In one forest, close-set trees shroud all 
light and seem to watch the adventurers as they pass. 
In another, sunlight streams through the leaves above 
and flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs 
of corruption-rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and 
rocks covered with slimy brown moss- can be a signal 
that the adventurers are drawing close to the site of evil 
power that is their destination or can provide clues to 
the nature of the threats to be found there. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS 
Specific wilderness locations might have their own 
special features. For example, the Spirit Forest and 
the Spiderhaunt Woods might feature different kinds 
of trees, different kinds of flora and fauna, different 
weather. and different random encounter tables. 
Finally, a wilderness trek can be enhanced by calling 
attention to the weather. "You spend the next three 
days crossing the swamp" sounds less harrowing than, 
"You spend the next three days trudging through knee-
deep mud- the first two days and nights in the pouring 
rain, and then another day under the beating sun, with 
swarms of hungry insects feasting on your blood." 
HouR-BY-HouR APPROACH 
Sometimes the journey deserves as much time and 
attention as the destination. If wilderness travel feature 
prominently in your adventure and isn't something you 
want to gloss over, you will need more than a descriptive 
overview to bring a long and harrowing journey to life; 
you'll need to know the party's marching order and have 
encounters at the ready. 
Let your players determine the party's marching 
order (see the Player's Handbook for more information). 
Characters in the front rank are likely to be the first to 
notice landmarks and terrain features, as well as the 
ones responsible for navigating. Characters in the back 
rank are usually responsible for making sure that the 
party isn't being followed. Encourage characters in the 
middle ranks to do something other than blindly trudge 
along behind the front-rank characters. The Player's 
Handbook suggests activities such as mapmaking and 
foraging for food. 
Wilderness journeys typically feature a combination of 
planned encounters (encounters that you prepare ahead 
of time) and random encounters (encounters determined 
by rolling on a table). A planned encounter might need a 
m~p of the location where the encounter is set to occur, 
such as a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other 
memorable location. Random encounters tend to be 
less location-specific. The fewer planned encounters 
you have, the more you'll need to rely on random 
encounters to keep the journey interesting. See chapter 
3 for guidelines on creating your own random encounter 
tables and when to check for random encounters. 
A good way to keep wilderness encounters from 
becoming stale is to make sure they don't all start and 
end the same way. In other words, if the wilderness 
is your stage and your adventure is the play or movie, 
think of each wilderness encounter as its own scene, 
and try to stage each one in a slightly different way to 
keep your players' interest. If one encounter comes 
at the adventurers from the front, the next one might 
come at them from above or behind. If an encounter 
features stealthy monsters, a character tending to the 
party's pack animals might get the first indication that 
monsters are near when a pony whickers nervously. If 
an encounter features loud monsters, the party might 
have the option to hide or set an ambush. One group of 
monsters might attack the party on sight, and another 
might allow safe passage for food. 
Reward characters for searching while they travel by 
providing things for them to find. Broken statues, tracks,
