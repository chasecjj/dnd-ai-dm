after door and killing whatever lies beyond. But the 
ebb and flow of power between groups in a dungeon 
provides plenty of opportunities for more subtle 
interaction. Dungeon denizens are used to striking 
unlikely alliances, and adventurers are a wild card that 
canny monsters seek to exploit. 
Intelligent creatures in a dungeon have goals, whether 
as simple as short-term survival or as ambitious 
as claiming the entire dungeon as the first step in 
founding an empire. Such creatures might approach 
adventurers with an offer of alliance, hoping to prevent 
the characters from laying waste to their lair and to 
secure aid against their enemies. Bring the NPC leaders 
of such groups to life as described in chapter 4, fleshing 
out their personalities, goals, and ideals. Then use 
those elements to shape a response to the arrival of 
adventurers in their territory. 
DUNGEON ECOLOGY 
An inhabited dungeon has its own ecosystem. The 
creatures that live there need to eat, drink, breathe, and 
sleep, just as creatures in the wilderness do. Predators 
need to be able to seek prey, and intelligent creatures 
search for lairs offering the best combination of air, 
food, water, and security. Keep these factors in mind 
when designing a dungeon you want the players to 
believe in. If a dungeon doesn't have some internal logic 
to it, adventurers will find it difficult to make reasonable 
decisions within that environment. 
For example, characters who find a pool of fresh water 
in a dungeon might make the logical assumption that 
many of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon come to 
that spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush 
at the pool. Likewise, locked doors- or even doors that 
require hands to open-can restrict the movement of 
some creatures. If all the doors in a dungeon are closed, 
the players might wonder how the carrion crawlers or 
stirges they repeatedly encounter manage to survive. 
ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
You might be inclined to increase the encounter 
difficulty as the adventurers descend deeper into the 
dungeon, as a way to keep the dungeon challenging as 
the characters gain levels or to ratchet up the tension. 
However, this approach can turn the dungeon into a 
grind. A better approach is to include encountets of 
varying difficulty throughout. The contrast between easy 
and hard encounters, as well as simple and complex 
encounters, encourages characters to vary their tactics 
and keeps the encounters from seeming too similar. 
MAPPING A DUNGEON 
Every dungeon needs a map showing its layout. 
The dungeon's location, creator, purpose, history, 
and inhabitants should give you a starting point for 
designing your dungeon map. If you need further 
inspiration, you can find maps that have been made 
freely available for use on the Internet, or even use a 
map of a real-world location. Alternatively, you can 
borrow a map from a published adventure or randomly 
generate a dungeon complex using the tables presented 
in appendix A. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVlRONMENTS 
A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers 
in a ruined temple to a huge complex of rooms and 
passages extending hundreds of feet in all directions. 
The adventurers' goal often lies as far from the dungeon 
entrance as possible, forcing characters to delve 
deeper underground or push farther into the heart of 
the complex. 
A dungeon is most easily mapped on graph paper, 
with each square on the paper representing an area of 
10 feet by 10 feet. (If you play with miniatures on a grid, 
you might prefer a scale where each square represents 5 
feet, or you can subdivide your 10-foot grid into a 5-foot 
grid when you draw your maps for combat.) When you 
draw your map, keep the following points in mind: 
Asymmetrical rooms and map layouts make a 
dungeon less predictable. 
Think in three dimensions. Stairs, ramps, platforms, 
ledges, balconies, pits, and other changes of elevation 
make a dungeon more interesting and make combat 
encounters in those areas more challenging. 
• Give the dungeon some wear and tear. Unless you 
want to stress that the dungeon's builders were 
extraordinarily skillful, collapsed passages can be 
commonplace, cutting off formerly connected sections 
of the dungeon from each other. Past earthquakes 
might have opened chasms within a dungeon, splitting 
rooms and corridors to make interesting obstacles. 
Incorporate natural features into even a constructed 
dungeon. An underground stream might run through 
the middle of a dwarven stronghold, causing variation 
in the shapes and sizes of rooms and necessitating 
features such as bridges and drains. 
• Add multiple entrances and exits. Nothing gives the 
players a stronger sense of making real decisions than 
having multiple ways to enter a dungeon. 
Add secret doors and secret rooms to reward players 
who take.the time to search for them. 
If you need help creating a dungeon map from scratch,

DUNGEON FEATURES 
The atmosphere and physical characteristics of 
dungeons vary as widely as their origins. An old crypt 
might have stone walls and loose wooden doors, an odor 
of decay, and no light other than what adventurers bring 
with them. A volcanic lair might have smooth stone 
walls hollowed out by past eruptions, doors of magically 
reinforced brass, a smell of sulfur, and light provided by 
jets of flame in every hall and room. 
WALLS 
Some dungeons have walls of masonry. Others have 
walls of solid rock, hewn with tools to give them a 
rough, chiseled look, or worn smooth by the passage of 
water or lava. An aboveground dungeon might be made 
of wood or composite materials. 
Walls are sometimes adorned with murals, frescoes, 
bas-reliefs, and lighting fixtures such as sconces or 
torch brackets. A few even have secret doors built 
into them.
