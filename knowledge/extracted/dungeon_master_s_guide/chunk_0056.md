Chapter 5 offers suggestions for creating and fleshing 
out an adventure location, including tables that can 
help you establish the important elements of a dungeon, 
wilderness area, or urban setting.

An adventure can begin with a social interaction 
encounter in which the adventurers find out what they 
must do and why. It can start with a surprise attack, 
or with the adventurers coming across information by 
accident. The best introductions arise naturally from the 
goals and setting of the adventure. Let the entries in the 
Adventure Introduction table inspire you.
