THE NINE HELLS 
The Nine Hells of Baa tor inflame the imaginations of 
travelers, the greed of treasure seekers, and the battle 
fury of all moral creatures. It is the ultimate plane of 
law and evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. 
The devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws 
of their superiors, but they rebel within their individual 
castes. Most undertake any plot, no matter how foul, 
to advance themselves. At the very top of the hierarchy 
is Asmodeus, who has yet to be bested. If he were to 
be vanquished, the victor would rule the plane in turn. 
Such is the law of the Nine Hells. 
OPTIONAL RULE: PERVASIVE EVIL 
Evil pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane 
feel its influence. At the end of each long rest taken on 
this plane, a visitor that isn't evil must make a DC 10 
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's 
alignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes 
permanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within 
ld4 days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts 
to normal after one day spent on a plane other than the 
Nine Hells. Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the 
creature also restores its original alignment. 
THE NINE LAYERS 
The Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are 
each ruled by archdevils that answer to Asmodeus, 
the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the 
deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend 
through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The 
most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, 
which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer 
to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can 
withstand the torment and horror of that journey. 
Avernus. No planar portals connect directly to the 
lower layers of the Nine Hells, by Asmodeus's orders. 
As such, the first layer of Avernus is the arrival point 
for visitors to the plane. A vern us is a rocky wasteland 
with rivers of blood and clouds of biting flies. Fiery 
comets occasionally fall from the darkened sky and 
leave fuming impact craters behind. Empty battlefields 
are littered with weapons and bones, showing where the 
legions of the Nine Hells met enemies on their native 
soil and prevailed. 
The archduchess Zariel rules Avernus, supplanting 
her rival, Bel, who has fallen out of Asmodeus's favor 
and is forced to serve as Zariel's advisor. Tiamat, the 
Queen of Evil Dragons, is a prisoner on this layer, 
ruling her own domain but confined to the Nine Hells 
by Asmodeus in accordance with some ancient contract 
(the terms of which are known only to Tiamat and the 
Lords of the Nine). 
Zariel's seat of power is a soaring basalt citadel 
festooned with the partially incinerated corpses of 
guests who failed to earn the archduchess's favor. Zariel 
appears as an angel whose once-beautiful skin and 
wings have been ruined by fire. Her eyes burn with a 
furious white light that can cause creatures looking 
upon her to burst into flame. 
Dis. Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells, is a 
labyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer mountains 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE 
rich with iron ore. Iron roads span and wend through 
the canyons, watched over by the garrisons of iron 
fortresses perched atop jagged pinnacles. 
The second layer takes its name from its current lord. 
Dispater. A manipulator and deceiver, the archduke is 
devilishly handsome, bearing only small horns, a tail, 
and a cloven left hoof to distinguish him from a human. 
His crimson throne stands in the heart of the Iron City 
of Dis, a hideous metropolis that is the largest in the 
Nine Hells. Planar travelers come here to conspire with 
devils and to close deals with night hags, rakshasas, 
incubi, succubi, and other fiends. Dispater collects a 
piece of every deal through special provisions that are 
added to contracts signed on his layer of the Nine Hells. 
Dispater is one of Asmodeus's most loyal and 
resourceful vassals, and few beings in the multiverse 
can outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils 
with striking deals with mortals in exchange for their 
souls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil 
schemes in the Material Plane. 
Minauros. The third layer of the Nine Hells is a 
stench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer's 
brown skies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid 
surface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath the murk to 
engulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately 
carved stone rise up from the bog, including the great 
city of Minauros for which the layer is named. 
The slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into 
the air, protecting the flooded halls of Mammon. The 
Archduke of Minauros resembles a massive serpent 
with the upper torso and head of a hairless, horned 
humanoid. Mammon's greed is legendary, and he is 
one of the few arch devils who will trade favors for gold 
instead of souls. His lair is piled high with treasures 
left behind by those who tried-and failed-to best him 
in a deal. 
Phlegethos. Phlegethos, the fourth layer, is a 
fiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew 
hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic 
ash. Within the fire-filled caldera of Phlegethos's largest 
volcano rises Abriymoch, a fortress city cast of obsidian 
and dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring 
down its outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted 
centerpiece of a gigantic, hellish fountain. 
Abriymoch is the seat of power for the two archdevils 
who rule Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and 
Archduchess Fierna, Belial's daughter. Belial is a 
handsome, powerfully built devil who exudes civility, 
even as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His 
daughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the 
blackest heart in the 
ine Hells. The alliance of Belial 
and Fierna is unbreakable, for both are aware that their 
mutual survival hinges on it. 
Stygia. The fifth layer of the Nine Hells is a freezing 
realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea 
surrounds the layer. and its gloomy sky crackles with 
lightning. 
Archduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is 
now encased deep in the ice of Stygia as punishment. 
He rules this layer all the same, communicating 
telepathically with hi followers and servants, both in 
the Nine Hells and on the Material Plane.
