Finally, a creature can use an action to make an 
Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered 
on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the 
sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; 
each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the 
DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents 
the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or 
until the creature uses this ability again. 
PANDEMONIUM 
Pandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of 
rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is 
cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly 
extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches 
and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only 
by yelling, and even then only to a maximum distance 
of 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability 
check that relies on hearing. 
Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were 
banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many 
of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds 
or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die 
down until they sound like distant cries of torment. 
OPTIONAL RULE: MAD WINDS 
A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw 
after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a 
failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. 
A creature that reaches six levels of exhaustion while 
on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains 
a random form of indefinite madness, as described in 
chapter 8, "Running the Game." Finishing a long rest 
doesn't reduce a creature's exhaustion level unless the 
creature can somehow escape the maddening winds. 
THE ABYSS 
----------- --
The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and 
chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into 
ever more appalling forms. 
Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific 
environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are 
all harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the 
en tropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what one 
sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, 
crumbling, or corroded state. 
OPTIONAL RULE: ABYSSAL CORRUPTION 
A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss 
must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a 
failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the 
Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of 
this corruption. You can substitute different corruption 
effects of your own creation. 
After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can 
make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful 
save, the corruption effect ends. A dispel evil and good 
spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends 
the effect. 
If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within 
ld4 + 2 days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. 
Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature 
restores its original alignment. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE 
ABYSSAL CoRRUPTION 
dlO 
Result 
1-4 
Treachery. The character gains the following flaw: 
5-7 
8-9 
10 
"I can only achieve my goals by making sure that 
my companions don't achieve theirs." 
Bloodlust. The character gains the following flaw: 
"I enjoy killing for its own sake, and once I start, 
it's hard to stop." 
Mad Ambition. The character gains the following 
flaw: "I am destined to rule the Abyss, and my 
companions are tools to that end." 
Demonic Possession. The character is possessed 
by a demonic entity until freed by dispel evil and 
good or similar magic. Whenever the possessed 
character rolls a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, 
or saving throw, the demon takes control of the 
character and determines the character's behavior. 
At the end of each of the possessed character's 
turns, he or she can make a DC 15 Charisma saving 
throw. On a success, the character regains control 
until he or she rolls another 1. 
IMPORTANT LAYERS 
The layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords 
who rule them, as the following examples illustrate. 
More information about the demon lords can be found in 
the Monster Manual. 
The Gaping Maw. Demogorgon's layer in the Abyss 
is a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known 
as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons 
go insane with fear. Reflecting Demogorgon's dual 
nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval 
continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a 
seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine fiats. The 
Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine 
towers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower 
is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires 
constitute the fortress of Abysm, where few creatures 
can venture without descending into madness. 
Thanatos. If Orcus had his way, all planes would 
resemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures 
would become undead under his control. Under its 
black sky, Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren 
moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. 
Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi 
litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, 
bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any 
creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules 
Thanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted 
of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland 
called Oblivion's End, the palace is surrounded by tombs 
and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow 
valleys, creating a tiered necropolis. 
The Demonweb. Lolth's layer is an immense network 
of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and 
cocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, 
structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught 
in a spider's snare. The nature of Lolth's web creates 
random portals throughout the plane, drawing such 
objects in from demiplanes and Material Plane worlds
