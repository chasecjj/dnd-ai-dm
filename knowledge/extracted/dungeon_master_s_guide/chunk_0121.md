The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic 
prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, 
and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to 
damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege 
weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a 
wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell 
counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each 
casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to 
regain 50 hit points. 
DAGGER OF VENOM 
Weapon (dagger), rare 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. 
You can use an action to cause thick, black poison 
to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute 
or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. 
That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become 
poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this 
way again until the next dawn. 
DANCING SWORD 
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement) 
You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into 
the air and speak the command word. When you do so, 
the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks 
one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The 
-word uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to 
damage rolls. 
While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to 
cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet 
of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause 
rhe sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it. 
After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it 
ies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you 
have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If 
the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as 
close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also 
ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet 
away from it. 
DECANTER OF ENDLESS WATER 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it 
contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds. 
You can use an action to remove the stopper and 
speak one of three command words, whereupon an 
amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours 
out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start 
of your next turn. Choose from the following options: 
"Stream" produces 1 gallon of water. 
"Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water. 
• "Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes 
forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a 
bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim 
the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of 
you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength 
saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall 
prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object 
that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no 
more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked 
over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you. 
DECK OF ILLUSIONS 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full 
deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually 
missing 1d20 - 1 cards. 
The magic of the deck functions only if cards are 
drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing 
cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to 
draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the 
ground at a point within 30 feet of you. 
An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the 
thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory 
creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and 
behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the 
Monster Manual), except that it can do no harm. While 
you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and 
can see it, you can use an action to move it magically 
anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical 
interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an 
illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who
