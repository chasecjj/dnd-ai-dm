dedicated to preserving the natural order-might be 
less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated 
at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming 
-riendly by default only when a character has gained 10 
renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds 
apply only to the default attitude of most members of an 
organization, and such attitudes aren't automatic. NPC 
faction members might dislike an adventurer despite 
that character's renown-or perhaps because of it. 
Perks. Earning a rank within an organization comes 
with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of 
low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and 
adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to 
offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked 
character might gain a follower (see chapter 4, "Creating 
_ -onplayer Characters"), access to potions and scrolls, 
the ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous 
missions. A high-ranking character might be able to 
call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, 
gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special 
missions to members of lower rank. 
Downtime Activities. You might allow characters 
to spend downtime between adventures building 
;elationships and gaining renown within an 
organization. For more information on downtime 
activities, see chapter 6, "Between Adventures." 
L OSING RENOWN 
Disagreements with members of an organization 
aren't enough to cause a loss of renown within that 
organization. However, serious offenses committed 
against the organization or its members can result 
in a loss of renown and rank within the organization. 
The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is 
left to your discretion. A character's renown within an 
organization can never drop below 0. 
PIETY 
\Vith a few alterations, the renown system can also 
erve as a measure of a character's link to the gods. It's 
a great option for campaigns where the gods take active 
roles in the world. 
Using this approach, you track renown based on 
pecific divine figures in your campaign. Each character 
bas the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with 
goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any 
renown he or she earns is called piety. A character 
gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their 
commands,. and respecting their taboos. A character 
loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring 
them, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims. 
The gods bestow favors on those who prove their 
devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character 
can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually 
comes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor 
often comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for 
example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a 
pel! accompanied by the boom of thunder. 
A high level of piety can also lead to a character 
gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a 
blessing or charm (see chapter 7, "Treasure," for such 
upernatural gifts). 
MAGIC IN YouR WoRLD 
In most D&D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous 
and sometimes frightening. People everywhere know 
about magic, and most people see evidence of it at some 
point in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and moves 
through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, 
the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched 
by the gods, creatures born with supernatural power, 
and individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse. 
Histories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of 
those who wield it. 
What normal folk know of magic depends on where 
th.ey live and whether they know characters who 
practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not 
have seen true magic used for generations and speak 
in whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit 
living in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep 
in the Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order 
of Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These 
arcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the 
order's members can profit from selling their services. 
Some D&D settings have more magic in them than 
others. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun 
setting, arcane magic is a hated practice that can drain 
life from the world. Much of Athas's magic lies in the 
hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron, 
magic is as commonplace as any other commodity. 
Mercantile houses sell magic items and services to 
SAMPLE FACTION: THE ZHENTARIM 
The Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) is an 
unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its 
influence and power throughout the Forgotten Realms. 
The public face of the Black Network appears relatively 
benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, 
both legal and illicit, thus destroying its competitors and 
making everyone dependent on it. 
A member of the Zhentarim thinks of himself or herself 
as a member of a very large family and relies on the Black 
Network for resources and security. However, members are 
granted the autonomy to pursue their own interests and gain 
some measure of personal wealth and influence. As a whole, 
the Zhentarim promises "the best of the best," although 
in truth the organization is more interested in spreading 
its own propaganda and influence than investing in the 
improvement of its individual members. 
Motto. "join us and prosper. Oppose us and suffer." 
Beliefs. The Zhentarim's beliefs can be summarized 
as follows: 
• The Zhentarim is your family. You watch out for it, and it 
watches out for you. 
• You are the master of your own destiny. Never be less than 
what you deserve to be. 
Everything and everyone has a price. 
Goals. Amass wealth, power, and influence, and thereby 
dominate Faerun. 
Typical Quests. Typical Zhentarim quests include 
plundering or stealing a treasure hoard, powerful magic item, 
or artifact; securing a lucrative business contract or enforcing 
a preexisting one; and establishing a foothold in a place 
where the Zhentarim holds little sway.
