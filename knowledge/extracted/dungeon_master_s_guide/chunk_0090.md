15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the 
mechanism can be reached and the character can see. 
In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a 
secret door nearby) opens the pit. 
Spiked Pit. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or 
locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes 
at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 
(2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to 
any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison 
smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking 
piercing damage from the spikes must also make a 
DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) 
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. 
POISON DARTS 
Mechanical trap 
When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, 
poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or 
pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding 
walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, 
each one rigged to its own set of darts. 
The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and 
cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or 
frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC tq spot them is 
15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check, a character can deduce the presence of the 
pressure plate from variations in the mortar and 
stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding 
floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the 
pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing 
the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained 
within from launching. 
The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of 
weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four 
darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus 
against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure 
plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are 
no targets in the area, the darts don't hit anything.) A 
target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must 
ucceed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 
11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 
POISON NEEDLE 
J1echanical trap 
A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's 
lock, or in something else that a creature might open. 
Opening the chest without the proper key causes the 
needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison. 
When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 
mches straight out from the lock. A creature within 
range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison 
am age, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
-aving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. 
A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from 
al£erations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. 
_ 
_,_ uccessful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' 
tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from 
the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock 
triggers the trap. 
ROLLING SPHERE 
Mechanical trap 
When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this 
trap's pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling 
opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of 
solid stone. 
With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, 
a cb.aracter can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate . . 
A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 
15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations 
in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate's 
presence. The same check made while inspecting the 
ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the 
trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under 
the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. 
Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present 
to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 
bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. 
The sphere can move through creatures' spaces, and 
creatures can move through its space, treating it as 
difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's 
space or a creature enters its space while it's rolling, 
that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be 
knocked prone. 
The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. 
It can't go around corners, but smart dungeon builders 
incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages 
that allow the sphere to keep moving. 
As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can 
attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. 
On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by 
15 feet. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving 
and is no longer a threat. 
SPHERE OF ANNIHILATION 
Magic trap 
Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth 
of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in 
diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, 
no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter 
that enters it is instantly obliterated. 
A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
reveals that the mouth contains a sphere of annihilation 
that can't be controlled or moved. It is otherwise 
identical to a normal sphere of annihilation, as 
described in chapter 7, "Treasure." 
Some versions of the trap include an enchantment 
placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures 
feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl 
inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the 
sympathy aspect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. 
A successful dispel magic (DC 18) removes this 
enchantment.
