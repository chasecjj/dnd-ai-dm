.:uN COMBAT ENCOUNTERS 
:-3e following features can add more fun and suspense 
a combat encounter: 
Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the 
characters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope 
bridge and pools of green slime 
Terrain features that provide a change of elevation, 
uch as pits, stacks of empty crates, ledges, 
and balconies 
Features that either inspire or force characters and 
their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers, 
kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling blade traps 
Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive 
positions, so that characters who normally attack at 
range are forced to move around the battlefield

RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
.~s characters explore a wilderness area or dungeon 
omplex, they are bound to encounter the unexpected. 
i<.andom encounters are a way to deliver the unexpected. 
:hey are usually presented in the form of a table. When 
a random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult 
<he table to determine what the party encounters. 
Some players and DMs view random encounters in an 
adventure as time-wasters, yet well-designed random 
encounters can serve a variety of useful purposes: 
Create urgency. Adventurers don't tend to dawdle 
if the threat of random encounters is hanging over 
their heads. Wanting to avoid wandering monsters 
creates a strong incentive to look for a safe place to 
rest. (Rolling dice behind the DM screen can often 
accomplish this even without an actual encounter.) 
Establish atmosphere. The appearance of 
thematically linked creatures as random encounters 
helps to create a consistent tone and atmosphere 
for an adventure. For example, an encounter table 
filled with bats, wraiths, giant spiders, and zombies 
creates a sense of horror, and tells the adventurers to 
prepare for battle with even more powerful creatures 
of the night. 
Drain character resources. Random encounters can 
drain the party's hit points and spell slots, leaving the 
adventurers feeling underpowered and vulnerable. 
This creates tension, as players are forced to make 
decisions based on the fact that their characters aren't 
at full strength. 
Provide assistance. Some random encounters can 
benefit the characters instead of hindering or harming 
them. Helpful creatures or NPCs might provide the 
adventurers with useful information or assistance 
when they need it most. 
Add interest. Random encounters can reveal details 
about your world. They can foreshadow danger or 
provide hints that will help the adventurers prepare 
for the encounters to come. 
• Reinforce campaign themes. Random encounters 
can remind the players of the major themes of the 
campaign. For example, if your campaign features an 
ongoing war between two nations, you might design 
random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present 
nature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables 
might include bedraggled troops returning from bat-
tle, refugees fleeing invading forces, heavily guarded 
caravans full of weapons, and lone messengers on 
horseback riding for the front lines. While charac-
ters are in hostile territory, the tables might include 
battlefields littered with the recently slain, armies of 
evil humanoids on the march, and improvised gib-
bets holding the bodies of deserters who tried to flee 
the conflict. 
Random encounters should never be tiresome to you 
or your players. You don't want the players to feel as if 
they aren't making progress because another random 
encounter brings their progress to a halt whenever they 
try to move forward. Likewise, you don't want to spend 
time distracted by random encounters that add nothing 
to the adventure narrative or that interfere with the 
overall pace you're trying to set. 
Not every DM likes to use random encounters. You 
might find that they distract from your game or are 
otherwise causing more trouble than you want. If 
random encounters don't work for you, don't use them. 
TRIGGERING RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
Because you want random encounters to build on the 
intended narrative of a game session, not compete with 
it, you should choose the placement of those encounters 
carefully. Think about a random encounter under any of 
the following circumstances: 
The players are getting off track and slowing 
down the game. 
The characters stop for a short or long rest. 
• The characters are undertaking a long, 
uneventful journey. 
The characters draw attention to themselves when 
they should be keeping a low profile.
