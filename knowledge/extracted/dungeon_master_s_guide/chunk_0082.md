STRONGHOLDS 
Strongholds provide the local population with protection 
in times of trouble. The number of strongholds in an 
area depends on the dominant society, the population, 
the strategic importance or vulnerability of the region, 
and the wealth of the land. 
WEIRD LOCALES 
Weird locales make the fantastic and the supernatural 
an intrinsic part of your wilderness adventures.

avage raiders.

EXTREME COLD 
Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees 
Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed 
on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each 
hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with 
resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically 
succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing 
cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and 
creatures naturally adapted to cold climates. 
EXTREME HEAT 
When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and 
without access to drinkable water must succeed on 
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour 
or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the 
first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. 
Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are 
clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving 
throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire 
damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as 
do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates. 
STRONG WIND 
A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon 
attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, 
disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means 
nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind 
must land at the end of its turn or fall. 
A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that 
imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
that rely on sight. 
HEAVY PRECIPITATION 
Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy 
snowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in the area 
have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that 
rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames 
and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks that rely on hearing. 
HIGH ALTITUDE 
--------------~------------------
Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above 
sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, 
because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the 
air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at 
high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of 
determining how long that creature can travel. 
Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high 
altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. 
Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to 
elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to 
such environments. 
WILDERNESS HAZARDS 
This section describes a few examples of hazards that 
adventurers might encounter in the wilderness. 
Some hazards, such as slippery ice and razorvine, 
require no ability check to spot. Others, such as 
defiled ground, are undetectable by normal senses. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVJRONMENTS 
The other hazards presented here can be identified 
with a successful Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the 
guidelines in chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any 
check made to spot or recognize a hazard. 
DESECRATED GROUND 
Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the 
unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated 
ground can be any size, and a detect evil and good spell 
cast within range reveals its presence. 
Undead standing on desecrated ground have 
advantage on all saving throws. 
A vial of holy water purifies a 10-foot-square area of 
desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a hallow 
spell purifies desecrated ground within its area. 
FRIGID WATER 
A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a 
number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before 
suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent 
in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a 
DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of 
exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to 
cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw. 
as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in 
ice-cold water. 
QUICKSAND 
A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a 10-foot-
square area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature 
enters the area, it sinks ld4 + 1 feet into the quicksand 
and becomes restrained. At the start of each of the 
creature's turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as 
the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, 
it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a 
Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet 
the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature 
that is completely submerged in quicksand can't breathe 
(see the suffocation rules in the Player's Handbook). 
A creature can pull another creature within its reach 
out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding 
on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of 
feet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand. 
RAZORVINE 
Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and 
hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and 
other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, 
5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11, 25 
hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and 
psychic damage. 
When a creature comes into direct contact with 
razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature 
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or 
take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvine's 
bladelike thorns. 
SLIPPERY IcE 
Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves 
onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must 
succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or 
fall prone.
