CHAPTER 7: TREASURE 
DVENTURERS STRIVE FOR MANY THINGS, 
including glory, knowledge, and justice. 
Many adventurers also seek something more 
tangible: fortune. Strands of golden chains, 
stacks of platinum coins, bejeweled crowns, 
enameled scepters, bolts of silk cloth, and 
powerful magic items all wait to be seized or unearthed 
by intrepid, treasure-seeking adventurers. 
This chapter details magic items and the placement of 
treasure in an adventure, as well as special rewards that 
can be granted instead of or in addition to magic items 
and mundane treasure. 
TYPES OF TREASURE 
Treasure comes in many forms. 
Coins. The most basic type of treasure is money, 
including copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), electrum 
pieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp). 
Fifty coins of any type weigh 1 pound. 
Gemstones. Gemstones are small, lightweight, and 
easily secured compared to their same value in coins. 
ee the "Gemstones" section for types of stones, gems, 
and jewels that can be found as treasure. 
Art Objects. Idols cast of solid gold, necklaces 
tudded with precious stones, paintings of ancient 
kings, bejeweled dishes- art objects include all these 
and more. See the "Art Objects" sectiori for types of 
decorative and valuable artworks that can be found 
as treasure. 
Magic Items. Types of magic items include armor, 
potions, scrolls, rings, rods, staffs, wands, weapons, 
and wondrous items. Magic items also have rarities: 
common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary. 
Intelligent monsters often use magic items in their 
possession, while others might hide them away to 
ensure they don't get lost or stolen. For example, if a 
hobgoblin tribe has a +llongsword and an alchemy jug 
in its treasure hoard, the tribe's warlord might wield the 
word, while the jug is kept somewhere safe. 
RANDOM TREASURE 
The following pages contain tables that you can use 
to randomly generate treasures carried by monsters, 
tashed in their lairs, or otherwise hidden away. The 
placement of treasure is left to your discretion. The key 
is to make sure the players feel rewarded for playing, 
and that their characters are rewarded for overcoming 
dangerous challenges. 
TREASURE TABLES 
Treasure can be randomly allocated based on a 
monster's challenge rating. There are tables for 
challenge rating 0- 4, challenge rating 5- 10, challenge 
rating 11- 16, and challenge rating 17 and higher. Use 
these tables to randomly determine how much money 
an individual monster carries (the D&D equivalent of 
pocket change) or the amount of wealth found in a larger 
treasure hoard. 
'
USING THE INDIVIDUAL TREASURE TABLES 
An Individual Treasure table helps you randomly 
determine how much treasure one creature carries on 
its person. If a monster has no interest in amassing 
treasure, you can use this table to determine the 
incidental treasure left behind by the monster's victims. 
Use the Individual Treasure table that corresponds to 
the monster's challenge rating. Roll a dlOO, and read the 
result across to determine how many coins of each type 
the monster carries. The table also includes the average 
result in parentheses, should you wish to forgo another 
roll and save time. To determine the total amount of 
individual treasure for a group of similar creatures, you 
can save time by rolling once and multiplying the result 
by the number of creatures in the group. 
If it doesn't make sense for a monster to carry a large 
pile of coins, you can convert the coins into gemstones 
or art objects of equal value. 
USING THE TREASURE HOARD TABLES 
A Treasure Hoard table helps you randomly determine 
the contents of a large cache of treasure, the 
accumulated wealth of a large group of creatures (such 
as an ore tribe or a hobgoblin army), the belongings of 
a single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure 
(such as a dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party 
after completing a quest for a benefactor. You can also 
split up a treasure hoard so that the adventurers don't 
find or receive it all at once. 
When determining the contents of a hoard belonging 
to one monster, use the table that corresponds to that 
monster's challenge rating. When rolling to determine a 
treasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters, 
use the challenge rating of the monster that leads the 
group. If the hoard belongs to no one, use the challenge 
rating of the monster that presides over the dungeon 
or lair you are stocking. If the hoard is a gift from a 
benefactor, use the challenge rating equal to the party's 
average level. 
Every treasure hoard contains a random number of 
coins, as shown at the top of each table. Roll a dlOO and 
consult the table to determine how many gemstones or 
art objects the hoard contains, if any. Use the same roll 
to determine whether the hoard contains magic items. 
As with the individual treasure tables, average values 
are given in parentheses. You can use an average value 
instead of rolling dice to save time. 
If a treasure hoard seems too small, you can roll 
multiple times on the table. Use this approach for 
monsters that are particularly fond of amassing 
treasure. Legendary creatures that accumulate treasure 
are wealthier than normal. Always roll at least twice on 
the appropriate table and add the results together. 
You can hand out as much or as little treasure as you 
want. Over the course of a typical campaign, a party 
finds treasure hoards amounting to seven rolls on the 
Challenge 0- 4 table, eighteen rolls on the Challenge 
5- 10 table, twelve rolls on the Challenge 11- 16 table, 
and eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table.
