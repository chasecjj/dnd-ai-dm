protecting lower-level NPC party members and to 
provide healing when this protection fails. 
A DVENTURER NPCs 
If you don't have enough players to form a full party, 
;·ou can use NPCs to fill out the ranks. These NPCs 
-hould be the same level as the lowest-level adventurer 
in the party and built (either by you or your players) 
using the character creation and advancement rules in 
the Player's Handbook. It's easiest on you if you let the 
players create and run these supporting characters. 
Encourage players to roleplay supporting characters 
a true to the NPCs' personality traits, ideals, bonds, 
and flaws as possible, so that they don't come across 
automatons. If you don't feel that an NPC is being 
portrayed well, you can take control of the NPC, give 
i to another player, or simply have the NPC leave 
~e party. 
J PC supporting characters are easier to play if you 
imit their class options. Good candidates for supporting 
characters include a cleric with the Life domain, a 
-ghter with the Champion archetype, a rogue with the 
- hief archetype, and a wizard specializing in Evocation. 
O PTIONAL RULE: LOYALTY 
_oyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine 
· ow far an NPC party member will go to protect or 
--sist the other members of the party (even those 
she doesn't particularly like). An NPC party 
·ho is abused or ignored is likely to abandon 
- e party, whereas an NPC who owes a life 
haracters or shares their goals might fight to the death 
:or them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by 
this rule. 
:..oYALTY ScoRE 
_.\n PC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 
to 20. The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal 
-o the highest Charisma score among all adventurers 
the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that 
umber. If the highest Charisma score changes-
;x:rhaps a character dies or leaves the group-adjust the 
-PC's loyalty score accordingly. 
TRA CKING LOYALTY 
'eep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that 
- e players won't know for sure whether an NPC party 
~ember is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently 
:mder a player's control). 
An NPC's loyalty score increases by ld4 if other party 
embers help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. 
:... - ·ewise, an NPC's loyalty score increases by ld4 if 
-· e PC is treated particularly well (for example, given 
a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party 
member. An NPC's loyalty score can never be raised 
above its maximum. 
When other party members act in a manner that 
;-uns counter to the NPC's alignment or bond, reduce 
-he PC's loyalty score by ld4. Reduce the NPC's 
nyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled, 
r endangered by other party members for purely 
: !fish reasons. 
An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer 
loyal to the party and might part ways with them. A 
loyalty score can never drop below 0. 
An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life 
and limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC's 
loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. 
An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the 
party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the 
party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or 
works in secret to bring about the party's downfall. 
CONTACTS 
Contacts are NPCs with close ties to one or more of 
the player characters. They don't go on adventures, 
but they can provide information, rumors, supplies, or 
professional advice, either for free or at a cost. Some 
of the backgrounds in the Player's Handbook suggest
