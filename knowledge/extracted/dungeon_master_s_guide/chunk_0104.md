STAFFS 
A magic staff is about 5 or 6 feet long. Staffs vary widely 
in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter 
throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, 
some are made of wood, and others are composed of 
polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a 
staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds. 
Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can 
be used as a quarterstaff. 
WANDS 
A magic wand is about 15 inches long and crafted of 
metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, 
stone, or some other material. 
WEAPONS 
Whether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to 
serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are 
coveted by many adventurers. 
Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon 
they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or 
VARIANT: MIXING POTIONS 
A character might drink one potion while still under the 
effects of another, or pour several potions into a single 
container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions 
can result in unpredictable interactions. 
When a character mixes two potions together, you can 
roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are 
combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining 
the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, 
reveal them only when they become evident.

The mixture creates a magical explosion, 
dealing 6d10 force damage to the mixer and 
1d10 force damage to each creature within 5 
feet of the mixer. 
The mixture becomes an ingested poison of 
the OM 's choice. 
Both potions lose their effects. 
One potion loses its effect. 
Both potions work, but with their numerical 
effects and durations halved. A potion has no 
effect if it can't be halved in this way. 
Both potions work normally. 
The numerical effects and duration of one 
potion are doubled. If neither potion has 
anything to double in this way, they work 
normally. 
Only one potion works, but its effect is 
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to 
make permanent, or the one that seems 
the most fun. For example, a potion of 
healing might increase the drinker's hit point 
maximum by 4, or oil of etherealness might 
permanently trap the user in the Ethereal 
Plane. At your discretion, an appropriate 
spell, such as dispel magic or remove curse, 
might end this lasting effect. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its weapon 
type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly. 
WONDROUS ITEMS 
Wondrous items include worn items such as boots, 
belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and 
decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. 
Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical 
instruments, and other objects also fall into this catch-
all category. 
WEARING AND WIELDING ITEMS 
Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing 
or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be 
donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, 
gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and 
rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a 
shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the 
shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand. 
In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn 
can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many 
magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or the: 
magically adjust themselves to the wearer. 
Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good 
reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain 
size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For 
example, armor made by the drow might fit elves only. 
VARIANT: SCROLL MISHAPS 
A creature who tries and fails to cast a spell from a spell scroll 
must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. If the saving 
throw fails, roll on the Scroll Mishap table.

A surge of magical energy deals the caster 1d6

The spell affects the caster or an ally 
(determined randomly) instead of the intended 
target, or it affects a random target nearby if the 
caster was the intended target.

The spell affects a random location within the 
spell's range.

The spell's effect is contrary to its normal one, 
but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, 
a fireball might produce an area of harmless 
cold. 
The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect 
related to the spell. Such effects last only 
as long as the original spell's duration, or 
1d10 minutes for spells that take effect 
instantaneously. For example, a fireball might 
cause smoke to billow from the caster's ears for 
1d10 minutes. 
The spell activates after 1d12 hours. If the 
caster was the intended target, the spell takes 
effect normally. If the caster was not the 
intended target, the spell goes off in the general 
direction of the intended target, up to the spell's 
maximum range, ifthe target has moved away.
