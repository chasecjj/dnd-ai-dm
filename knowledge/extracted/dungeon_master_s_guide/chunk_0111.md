AMULET OF 11EALTH 
ALcHEMY JuG 
MAGIC ITEMS A-Z 
Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A 
magic item's description gives the item's name, its 
category, its rarity, and its magical properties. 
ADAMANTINE ARMOR 
Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon 
This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one 
of the hardest substances in existence. While you're 
wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a 
normal hit. 
ALCHEMY jUG 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon 
of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. 
Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when 
it is shaken, even if the jug is empty. 
You can use an action and name one liquid from the 
table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen 
liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action 
and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The 
maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends 
on the liquid you named. 
Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce 
a different one, or more of one that has reached its 
maximum, until the next dawn.

ANIMATED SHIELD 
Armor (shield), very rare (requires atttinement)

word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield 
leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect 
you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. 
The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you 
use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are 
incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the 
ground or into your hand if you have one free. 
APPARATUS OF KWALISH 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel 
weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, 
which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a 
hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or 
smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in 
a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to 
move either up or down. When certain levers are used, 
the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. 
The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the 
following statistics: 
Armor Class: 20 
Hit Points: 200 
Speed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and 
tail aren't extended) 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 
To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. 
While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment 
is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds 
enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the 
number of breathing creatures inside. 
The apparatus floats on water. It can also go 
underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the 
vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute 
from pressure. 
APPARATUS OF K W A LIS H 
A creature in the compartment can use an action to 
move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or 
down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral 
position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as 
shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.
