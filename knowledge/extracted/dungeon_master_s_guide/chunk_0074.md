C HANNEL DIVINITY 
An Oathbreaker paladin of 3rd level or higher gains the 
:ollowing two Channel Divinity options. 
Control Undead. As an action, the paladin targets one 
ndead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him 
or her. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. 
On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin's 
commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin 
uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead 
whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the 
paladin's level is immune to this effect. 
Dreadful Aspect. As an action, the paladin channels 
the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of 
magical menace. Each creature of the paladin's choice 
within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom 
saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, 
the target is frightened of the paladin for 1 minute. If a 
creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 
30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another 
Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it. 
AURA OF HATE 
Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well any fiends and 
undead within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus 
to melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladin's 
Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can 
benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time. 
f\t 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 
SUPERNATURAL RESISTANCE 
At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to 
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from 
nonmagical weapons. 
DREAD LORD 
At 20th-level, the paladin can, as an action, surround 
himself or herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 
minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot 
radius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an 
enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn 
in the aura, it takes 4dl0 psychic damage. Additionally, 
the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura 
are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on 
sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures 
draped in this shadow. 
While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus 
action on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the 
aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a 
melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, 
the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 +.the 
paladin's Charisma modifier. 
After activating the aura, the paladin can't do so again 
until he or she finishes a long rest. 
0ATHBREAKER ATONEMENT 
If you allow a player to choose the Oath breaker option, 
you can later allow the paladin to atone and become a true 
paladin once more. 
The paladin who wishes to atone must first shed his or 
her evil alignment and demonstrate this alignment change 
through words and deeds. Having done so, the paladin 
loses all Oath breaker features and must choose a deity 
and a sacred oath. (With your permission, the player can 
select a different deity or sacred oath than the character 
had previously.) However, the paladin doesn't gain the 
class featu res specific to that sacred oath until he or 
she completes some kind of dangerous quest or trial, as 
determined by the DM . 
A paladin who breaks his or her sacred oath a second time 
can become an oath breaker once more, but can't atone.
