CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
SENTIENT MAGIC ITEMS 
Some magic items possess sentience and personality. 
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirr· 
of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic 
used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a 
character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, 
bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might 
be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn 
in the side. 
Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of ite -
can manifest sentience, but consumable items such a_ 
potions and scrolls are never sentient. 
Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the 
DM's control. Any activated property of the item is 
under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as 
the wielder maintains a good relationship with the 
item, the wielder can access those properties normall_ -
If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress 
its activated properties or even turn them against 
the wielder. 
CREATING SENTIENT MAGIC ITEMS 
When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you 
create the item's persona in the same way you would 
create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here. 
ABILITIES 
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and 
Charisma scores. You can choose the item's abilities 
or determine them randomly. To determine them 
randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest r 
and totaling the rest. 
COMMUNICATION 
A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either 
by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts 
telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how · 
communicates or roll on the following table.
