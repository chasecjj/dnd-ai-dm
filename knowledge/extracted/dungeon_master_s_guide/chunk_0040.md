trapped innocent mortals in these domains as well. 
OPTIONAL RULE: 
SHADOWFELL DESPAIR 
A melancholic atmosphere pervades the Shadowfell. 
Extended forays to this plane can afflict characters with 
despair, as reflected in this optional rule. 
When you deem it appropriate, though usually not 
more than once per day, you can require a character 
not native to the Shadowfell to make a DC 10 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failure, the character is affected by 
despair. Roll a d6 to determine the effects, using the 
Shadowfell Despair table. You can substitute different 
despair effects of your own creation. 
SHADOWFELL DESPAIR 
d6 
Effect 
l-3 
Apathy. The character has disadvantage on 
death saving throws and on Dexterity checks for 
initiative, and gains the following flaw: "I don't 
believe I can make a difference to anyone or 
anything." 
4-5 
Dread. The character has disadvantage on all 
saving throws and gains the following flaw: "I am 
convinced that this place is going to kill me." 
6 
Madness. The character has disadvantage 
on ability checks and saving throws that use 
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, and gains the 
following flaw: "I can't tell what's real anymore." 
If a character is already suffering a despair effect and 
fails the saving throw, the new despair effect replaces 
the old one. After finishing a long rest, a character 
can attempt to overcome the despair with a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it's 
harder to shake off despair once it has taken hold.) 
On a successful save, the despair effect ends for that 
character. 
A calm emotions spell removes despair, as does any 
spell or other magical effect that removes a curse. 
EVER NIGHT 
The city of Neverwinter in the world of the Forgotten Realms 
has a dark reflection on the Shadowfell: the city of Evernight. 
Evernight is a city of cracked stone edifices and homes of 
rotten wood. Its roads are made mostly of trampled grave 
dust, and its few cobbled streets are missing enough stones 
that they appear pockmarked. The sky is corpse gray, and the 
breeze blows cold and humid, bringing a chill to the skin. 
The city's living residents include mad necromancers, 
corrupt purveyors of human flesh, worshipers of evil deities, 
and others who are able to make themselves useful and crazy 
enough to want to live here. But the living are a minority 
in Evernight, for the bulk of the population consists of the 
shambling dead. Zombies, wights, vampires, and other 
undead make the city their home, all under the watchful eyes 
of the ruling caste: intelligent, flesh-eating ghouls. 
Rumors abound that this foul place mirrors one city on 
every world.

CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE 
jill' 
INNER PLANES 
He was lying on his back upon baked and smoldering stone. 
staring up at a smoky gray sky lit fro m distant and unseen 
fires. Around him, a sea of lava burped gouts of gas and jets 
of flame. The Elemental Plane of Fire. 
Thank the fell ones, Vhok thought. I never thought I'd be 
so happy to be here. 
-Thomas M. Reid, The Gossamer Plain 
The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material 
Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental 
substance from which all worlds were made. The four 
Elemental Planes- Air, Earth, Fire, and Water- form 
a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within 
a churning realm known as the Elemental Chaos. 
These planes are all connected, and the border regions 
between them are sometimes described as distinct 
planes in their own right. 
At their innermost edges, where they are closest 
to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal 
geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes 
resemble places in the Material Plane. The four 
elements mingle together as they do in the Material 
Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. But the dominant 
element exerts a strong influence on the environment, 
reflecting its fundamental qualities. 
The inhabitants of this inner ring include aarakocra, 
azers, dragon turtles, gargoyles, genies, mephits, 
salamanders, and xorn. Some originated on the 
Material Plane, and all can travel to the Material 
Plane (if they have access to the magic required) and 
survive there. 
As. they extend farther from the Material Plane, 
the Elemental Planes become increasingly alien and 
hostile. Here, in the outermost regions, the elements 
exist in their purest form: great expanses of solid earth, 
blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. Any 
foreig-n substance is extremely rare; little air can be 
found in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Earth, 
and earth is all but impossible to find in the outermost 
reaches of the Plane of Fire. These areas are much less 
hospitable to travelers from the Material Plane than 
the border regions are. Such regions are little known, 
so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a 
speaker usually means the border region. 
The outermost regions are largely the domains of 
elemental spirits barely recognizable as creatures. 
The creatures usually called elementals dwell here, 
including the Elemental Princes of Evil (primordial 
beings of pure elemental fury) and elemental spirits 
that spellcasters can bind into galeb duhrs, golems, 
invisible stalkers, magmin, and water weirds. These 
elemental creatures don't need food or other sustenance 
on their home planes, because they are sustained by the 
elemental energies that saturate those planes. 
ELEMENTAL CHAOS ----
At the farthest extents of the Elemental Planes, the pure 
elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending
