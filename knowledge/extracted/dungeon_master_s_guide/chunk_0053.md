have the celestial type and are always brave and 
kindhearted, but otherwise they look and behave like 
normal dwarves. 
OPTIONAL RULE : PLANA R VITALITY 
Vhile on this plane, creatures can't be frightened or 
poisoned, and they are immune to disease and poison. 
OTHER PLANES 
A variety of realms exist between or beyond the 
other planes. 
T HE OUTLANDS AND SIGIL 
The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes. 
Ir is the plane of neutrality, incorporating a little of 
everything and keeping all aspects in a paradoxical 
balance- simultaneously concordant and in opposition. 
The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains, 
and shallow rivers. 
The Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact, 
£hose whp envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point 
(Q the ovtlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the 
planes. That argument might be circular, since the 
a rrange~ent of the Outlands inspired the idea of the 
Great \\\heel in the first place. 
Aroun'd the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, 
are the g~te-towns: sixteen settlements, each built 
around a ~ortalleading to one of the Outer Planes. Each 
rown shares many of the characteristics of the plane 
where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in 
these towns, so it isn't unusual to see strange pairings, 
such as a celestial and a fiend arguing in a tavern while 
sharing a fine bottle of wine. 
Given the fact that you can ride a horse in the 
Outlands from a heaven to a hell, a planar-themed 
campaign can be set there without the need for planar 
travel. The Outlands is the closest the Outer Planes 
come to being like a world on the Material Plane.

SIGIL, CITY OF DOORS 
At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great 
wheel, is the Spire-a needle-shaped mountain that 
rises high into the sky. Above this mountain's narrow 
peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its myriad 
structures built on the ring's inner rim. Creatures 
standing on one of Sigil's streets can see the city curve 
up over their heads and- most disconcerting of all-the 
far side of the city directly overhead. Called the City of 
Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless 
portals to other planes and worlds. 
Sigil is a trader's paradise. Goods, merchandise, and 
information come here from across the planes. The city 
sustains a brisk trade in information about the planes, 
particularly the command words or items required for 
the operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all 
kinds are bought and sold here. 
The city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain, 
a being as old as gods and with purposes unknown to 
even the sages of her city. Is Sigil her prison? Is she the 
fallen creator of the multiverse? No one knows. Or if 
they do, they aren't telling. 
DEMIPLANES 
Demiplanes are extradimensional spaces that come 
into being by a variety of means and boast their own 
physical laws. Some are created by spells. Others exist 
naturally, as folds of reality pinched off from the rest 
of the multiverse. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can 
carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency 
required for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to 
acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the 
caster knows of the demiplane. 
A demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or 
large enough to contain an entire realm. For example, 
a Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion spell creates a 
demiplane consisting of a foyer with multiple adjoining 
rooms, while the land of Barovia (in the Ravenloft 
setting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the 
sway of its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a 
demiplane is connected to the Material Plane or some 
other plane, entering it can be as simple as stepping 
through a portal or passing through a wall of mist. 
THE FAR REALM 
The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In 
fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its 
own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies 
from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter 
is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable 
geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers 
and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its 
strange influence. 
The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are 
too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. 
Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and 
unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who 
dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm 
is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of 
matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this 
struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone

who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, 
tentacles. and horror. 
The Far Realm has no well-know;n portals, or at least 
none that are still viable. Ancient elves once opened a 
vast portal to the Far Realm within ~ mountain called 
Firestorm Peak, but their civilizatioi imploded in bloody 
terror and the portal's location-eve 
1 its home world- is 
long forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by 
an alien magic that mutates the area kround them. 
KNOWN WORLDS dF 
THE 
I 
MATERIAL PLANE 
Worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The 
most widely known worlds are the ones that have been 
published as official campaign settings for the D&D 
game over the years. If your campaign takes place on 
one of these worlds, that world belongs to you in your 
campaign. Your version of the world can diverge wildly 
from what's in print. 
On Toril (the heroic-fantasy world of the Forgotten 
Realms setting), fantastic cities and kingdoms stand 
amid the remains of ancient empires and realms 
long forgotten. The world is vast, its dungeons rich 
with history. Beyond the central continent of Faerun, 
Tori! includes the regions of Al-Qadim, Kara-Tur, 
and Maztica. 
On Oerth (the sword-and-sorcery world of the 
Greyhawk setting), heroes such as Bigby and 
Mordenkainen are driven by greed or ambition. The 
hub of the region called the Flanaess is the Free City of 
Greyhawk, a city of scoundrels and arch magi, rife with 
adventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish 
realm in the north, threatening all civilization. 
On Krynn (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance 
setting),. the return of the gods is overshadowed by the 
rise of the evil dragon queen Takhisis and her dragons 
and dragonarmies, which plunge the continent of 
Ansalon into war. 
On Athas (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark 
Sun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a 
human life. The gods have abandoned this desert world, 
where powerful sorcerer-kings rule as tyrants, and 
metal is a scarce and precious commodity. 
On Eberron (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron 
setting), a terrible war has ended, giving rise to a cold 
war fueled by political intrigue. On the continent of 
Khorvaire, magic is commonplace, dragonmarked 
houses rival kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles 
make travel to the far corners of the world possible. 
On Aebrynis (the heroic-fantasy world of the 
Birthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines 
carve up the continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates, 
guildmasters, and great wizards balance the demands 
of rulership against the threat of horrible abominations 
born from the blood of an evil god. 
On Mystara (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the 
earliest editions of the D&D game), diverse cultures, 
savage monsters, and warring empires collide. 
The world is further shaped by the meddling of the 
Immortals- former adventurers raised to nearly 
divine status.
