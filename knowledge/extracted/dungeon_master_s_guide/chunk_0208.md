OVERRUN 
When a creature tries to move through a hostile 
creature's space, the mover can try to force its way 
through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an 
action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength 
(Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's 
Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the 
overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than 
the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If 
the mover wins the contest, it can move through the 
hostile creature's space once this turn. 
SHOVE ASIDE 
With this option, a creature uses the special shove 
attack from the Player's Handbook to force a target 
to the side, rather than away. The attacker has 
disadvantage on its Strength (Athletics) check when it 
does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves 
the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach. 
TUMBLE 
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's 
space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an 
action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the 
contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space 
once this turn. 
HITTING COVER 
When a ranged attack misses a target that has cover, 
you can use this optional rule to determine whether the 
cover was struck by the attack. 
First, determine whether the attack roll would have 
hit the protected target without the cover. If the attack 
roll falls within a range low enough to miss the target 
but high enough to strike the target if there had been 
no cover, the object used for cover is struck. If a creature 
is providing cover for the missed creature and the 
attack roll exceeds the AC of the covering creature, the 
covering creature is hit. 
CLEAVING THROUGH CREATURES 
If your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower-
level monsters, consider using this optional rule to help 
speed up such fights. 
When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature 
to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack 
might carry over to another creature nearby. The 
attacker targets another creature within reach and, if 
the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining 
damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is 
likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, 
carrying over the remaining damage until there are no 
valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to 
reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points. 
INJURIES ___ 
_ 
Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This 
option introduces the potential for long-term injuries. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
It's up to you to decide when to check for a lingering 
injury. A creature might sustain a lingering injury under 
the following circumstances: 
When it takes a critical hit 
When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright 
When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more 
To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the 
Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical 
humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for 
creatures with different body types. 
LINGERING INJURIES 
d20 
Injury 
Lose an Eye. You have disadvantage on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks that rely on sight and on 
ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the regenerate 
spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes 
left after sustaining this injury, you're blinded. 
2 
Lose an Arm or a Hand. You can no longer hold 
anything with two hands, and you can hold only a 
single object at a time. Magic such as the regenerate 
spell can restore the lost appendage. 
3 
Lose a Foot or Leg. Your speed on foot is halved, 
and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless 
you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall 
prone after using the Dash action. You have 
disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. 
Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the 
lost appendage. 
4 
Limp. Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You 
must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after 
using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall 
prone. Magical healing removes the limp. 
5-7 
Internal Injury. Whenever you attempt an action 
in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action 
and can't use reactions until the start of your next 
turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing 
or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting. 
8-10 
Broken Ribs. This has the same effect as Internal 
Injury above, except that the save DC is 10. 
11-13 
Horrible Scar. You are disfigured to the extent that 
the wound can't be easily concealed. You have 
disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks 
and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. 
Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal 
and regenerate, removes the scar. 
14-16 
Festering Wound. Your hit point maximum is 
reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. 
If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. 
The wound heals if you receive magical healing. 
Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and 
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 
24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. 
17-20 
Minor Scar. The scar doesn't have any adverse 
effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such 
as heal and regenerate, removes the scar.
