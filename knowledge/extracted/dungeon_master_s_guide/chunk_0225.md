CONNECTING AREAS 
When your map is done, consider adding doors between 
chambers and passages that are next to each other but 
otherwise not connected. Such doors create more paths 
through the dungeon and expand players' options. 
If your dungeon consists of more than one level, be 
sure that any stairs, pits, and other vertical passages 
line up between levels. If you're using graph paper, 
lay a new page on top of your existing map, mark the 
locations of stairs and other features shared by the two 
levels, and begin mapping the new level. 
STOCKING A DUNGEON 
Creating a map for your dungeon is only half the fun. 
Once you have the layout, you need to decide what 
challenges and rewards are to be found in the dungeon's 
passages and chambers. Any reasonably large space 
should be stocked with interesting sights, sounds, 
objects, and creatures. 
You don't need to have every last detail of your 
dungeon plotted out. You can get by with nothing more 
than a list of monsters, a list of treasures, and a list of 
one or two key elements for each dungeon area. 
CHAMBER PURPOSE 
A room's purpose can help determine its furnishings 
and other contents. 
For each chamber on your dungeon map, establish its 
purpose or use the tables below to generate ideas. Each 
type of dungeon described in the "Dungeon Purpose" 
APPENDIX A I RANDOM DUNGEONS 
section of chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," has its 
own table featuring chambers geared to the dungeon's 
purpose. For example, if you're building a tomb, use the 
Dungeon: Tomb table to help you determine the purpose 
of each chamber. These dungeon-specific tables are 
followed by the General Dungeon Chambers table, 
which you can use if your dungeon isn't an exact fit for 
one of the standard types of dungeon or if you want to 
mix things up. 
Relying on random rolls to stock an entire dungeon 
can lead to incongruous results. A tiny room might end 
up being identified as a temple, while the huge chamber 
next door serves as storage. It can be fun to try to make 
sense of such strange design ideas, but make changes 
as you see fit. You can set aside a few key rooms and 
create specific contents for them.
