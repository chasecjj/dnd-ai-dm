To keep players from straying, save your best ideas for 
the very end of your adventures, or insert them during 
periods of downtime. 
Here are a few examples of ways in which an 
adventure seed can be revealed: 
On a villain's corpse, the characters find evidence that 
the villain was working for someone else. 
A captured NPC reveals the location of someone or 
something that might interest the characters. 
The characters are heading to a local tavern when 
they spot a wanted poster or a missing person poster 
(complete with the promise of a sizable reward). 
• Members of the local militia or city watch put out the 
word that a crime has been committed, and they're 
looking for potential witnesses and suspects. 
• The characters receive an anonymous letter that 
sheds light on a plot or impending event of which they 
were previously unaware. 
FORESHADOWING -------------------
Foreshadowing is an exercise in subtlety, involving the 
delicate planting of seeds for future adventures. Not all 
foreshadowing bears fruit, particularly if the clues are 
too subtle or if events conspire to take your campaign 
in a new direction. The goal of foreshadowing is to hint 
at upcoming events and new threats in your campaign 
without making it obvious to players that you're telling 
them what the future holds. Here are a few examples: 
• An object worn or carried by an enemy has the symbol 
of a previously unknown organization engraved or 
written on it. 
A mad woman standing on a street corner spouts 
fragments of an ancient prophecy, while pointing a 
crooked finger at the characters. 
The king and queen announce the marriage of their 
son to the daughter of a neighboring monarch, but 
various factions oppose the union. Trouble is brewing. 
Bugbear scouts are making incursions into civilized 
lands and spying on settlements, as a prelude to a 
hobgoblin warlord's invasion. 
· 
• A puppet show in a market square predicts a tragic 
outcome if two noble houses on the cusp of declaring 
war on each other refuse to reconcile. 
NPC adventurers in a city are being murdered in a 
similar yet unusual manner, hinting at a future threat 
to the player characters. 
CAMPAIGN TRACKING 
Consistent details bring your campaign to life, and 
continuity helps players imagine that their characters 
are living in a real world. If the adventurers frequent 
a particular tavern, the staff, layout of the building, 
and decor shouldn't change much from one visit to the 
next. That said, changes can occur as a result of the 
characters' actions or of actions they learn about. When 
the adventurers kill a monster, it stays dead, unless 
someone raises it. When they remove treasure from 
a room, it doesn't reappear the next time they enter-
assuming it hasn't been stolen from them! If they leave a 
door open, it should Stay open until someone closes it. 
CHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES 
No one's memory is infallible, so it pays to keep 
records. Jot notes directly on an adventure map to 
keep track of open doors, disarmed traps, and the like. 
Events beyond the scope of a single adventure are be 
recorded in a notebook dedicated to your campaign. 
Whether it's a physical book or an electronic file, such_ 
record is a great way to keep your notes organized. 
Your notebook might include any of the 
following elements. 
Campaign Planner. Write down the main story arc 
your campaign, and keep track of things that you hope 
appear in future adventures. Update it as the campaigr:. 
develops, adding ideas as they come to you. 
Character Notes. Write down the characters' 
backgrounds and goals, since these notes can help you 
design adventure content that provides opportunities ~ 
character development. 
Keep a running tally of the adventurers' classes and 
levels, as well as any quests and downtime activities 
they're engaged in. 
If the characters have a ship or stronghold, record iL 
name and whereabouts, as well as any hirelings in the 
characters' employ. 
Player Handouts. Keep a copy of all handouts 
you make for your players so that you don't have to 
remember their contents later. 
Adventure Log. Think of this log as an episode guide 
for your campaign. Summarize each game session 
or adventure to help you keep track of the unfolding 
campaign story. You can give your players access to thE 
log as well, or to an edited version stripped of your nor · 
and secrets. (The players might also keep their own 
record of adventures, which you can refer to if your ow-
log is incomplete.) 
NPC Nqtes. Record statistics and roleplaying notes 
for any NPC the characters interact with more than 
once. For example, your notes might differentiate 
important people in a town by their different voices, 
as well as their names, the places where they live 
and work, the names of their family members and 
associates, and maybe even a secret that each one 
of them has. 
Campaign Calendar. Your world feels more real to 
your players when the characters notice the passage of 
time. Note details such as the change of seasons and 
major holidays, and keep track of any important event 
that affect the larger story. 
Toolbox. Keep notes whenever you create or 
significantly alter a monster, magic item, or trap. Keep 
any maps, random dungeons, or encounters you create. 
This information ensures you won't repeat your work. 
and you'll be able to draw on this material later. 
RECURRING EXPENSES 
Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a 
particular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional 
drains on their adventuring income. Player characters 
who come into possession of property, own businesses. 
and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that 
accompany these ventures.
