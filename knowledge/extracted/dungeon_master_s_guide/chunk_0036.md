dead god or other chunks of rock drifting forever in the 
silvery void. Much more commonplace are color pools-
magical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant, 
spinning coins. 
Creatures on the Astral Plane don't age or suffer from 
hunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live 
on the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish 
outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so 
their children can grow to maturity. 
A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply 
thinking about moving, but distance has little meaning. 
In combat, though, a creature's walking.speed (in feet) is 
equal to 3 x its Intelligence score. The smarter a creature 
is, the easier it can control its movement by act of will. 
ASTRAL PROJECTION 
Traveling through the Astral Plane by means of 
the astral projection spell involves projecting one's 
consciousness there, usually in search of a gateway to an 
Outer Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as much 
spiritual states of being as they are physical places, this 
allows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he 
or she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream. 
A character's death-either in the Astral Plane or on 
the destination plane-causes no actual harm. Only the 
severing of a character's silver cord while on the Astral 
Plane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body 
on the Material Plane) can result in the character's true 
death. Thus, high-level characters sometimes travel to 
the Outer Planes by way of astral projection rather than 
eek out a portal or use a more direct spell. 
Only a few things can sever a traveler's silver cord, the 
most common being a psychic wind (described below). 
The legendary silver swords of the githyanki also have 
this ability. A character who travels bodily to the Astral 
Plane (by means of the plane shift spell or one of the 
.-are portals that leads directly there) has no silver cord. 
C OLOR POOLS 
Gateways leading from the Astral Plane to other 
planes appear as two-dimensional pools of rippling 
colors, ld6 x 10 feet in diameter. Traveling to another 
plane requires locating a color pool that leads to the 
desired plane. These gateways to other planes can be 
:dentified by color, as shown on the Astral Color Pools 
table. Finding the right color pool is a matter of chance: 
.ocating the correct one takes ld4 x 10 hours of travel.

PSYCHIC WIND 
A psychic wind isn't a physical wind like that found on 
the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters 
travelers' minds rather than their bodies. A psychic 
wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas, 
minor musings, and subconscious fears that went 
astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this 
powerful force. 
A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of 
the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes 
as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the 
traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself 
was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes, 
the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal 
in a few rounds. 
The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a 
location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers 
journeying together suffers the same location effect. 
Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a 
DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the 
traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20 
twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to 
determine the location and mental effects.
