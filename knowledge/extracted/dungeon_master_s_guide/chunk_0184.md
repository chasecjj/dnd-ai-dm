For example, imagine a wizard is running down a 
dungeon cor~idor to escape from a beholder. Around 
the corner ahead, two ogres lie in wait. Does the wizard 
hear the ogres readying their ambush? You look at 
the wizard's passive Wisdom (Perception) score and 
consider all the factors weighing on it. 
The wizard is running, not paying attention to what's 
ahead of him. This imposes disadvantage on the 
wizard's ability check. However, the ogres are readying 
a portcullis trap and making a lot of noise with a winch, 
which could grant the wizard advantage on the check. 
As a result, the character has neither advantage nor 
disadvantage on the Wisdom check, and you don't need 
to consider any additional factors. Past encounters with 
an ogre ambush, the fact that the wizard's ears are 
still ringing from the thunderwave spell he cast at the 
beholder, the overall noise level of the dungeon- none of 
that matters any more. They all cancel out. 
INSPIRATION 
Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage 
roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the Player's 
Handbook, having inspiration gives a character an 
obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one 
ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember 
that a character can have no more than one inspiration 
at a time. 
AWARDING INSPIRATION 
Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to 
enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using 
inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of 
the game. If you take away anything from this section, 
remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the 
game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration 
when players take actions that make the game more 
exciting, amusing, or memorable. 
As a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each 
character about once per session of play. Over time, you 
might want to award inspiration more or less often, at 
a rate that works best for your table. You might use the 
same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might 
change it with each campaign. 
Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain 
types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as 
a DM and your group's preferences. What helps make 
the game more fun for your group? What type of action 
fit in with your campaign's style or genre? Your answer 
to those questions help determine when you award 
inspiration. 
Roleplaying. Using inspiration to reward roleplaying 
is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a 
player with inspiration when that player causes his or 
her character to do something that is consistent with 
the character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The 
character's action should be notable in some way. It 
might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into 
danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence. 
you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that 
makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else. 
Take into account each player's roleplaying style, and 
try not to favor one style over another. For example, 
Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and 
adopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels 
self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe 
his character ~s attitude and actions. Neither style is 
better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to 
take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly 
makes the game better for everyone. 
Heroism. You can use inspiration to encourage 
player characters to take risks. A fighter might not 
normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the mid 
of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the 
character's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a 
reward tells the players that you want them to embrace 
swashbuckling action. 
This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize 
action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider 
allowing inspiration to be spent after a d20 roll, rather 
than before. This approach turns inspiration into a 
cushion against failure-and a guarantee that it comes 
into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. 
Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting. 
A Reward for Victory. Some DMs prefer to play an 
impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally 
requires a DM's judgment to award, which might 
run against your style if you like a campaign where 
you let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your
