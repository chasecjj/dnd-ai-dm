For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish 
some shared assumptions about the campaign so that 
DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each 
other's plans. 
COMBAT OPTIONS 
The options in this section provide alternative ways to 
handle combat. The main risk of adding some of these 
rules is slowing down play. 
INITIATIVE VARIANTS 
----
This section offers different ways to handle initiative. 
INITIATIVE ScoRE 
• With this optional rule, creature don't roll initiative 
at the start of combat. Instead, each creature has an 
initiative score, which is a passive Dexterity check: 
10 +Dexterity modifier. 
By cutting down on die rolls, math done on the fly, 
and the process of asking for and recording totals, you 
can speed your game up considerably-at the cost of an 
initiative order that is often predictable. 
SIDE INITIATIVE 
Recording initiative for each PC and monster, arrangin 
everyone in the correct order, and remembering where 
you are in the list can bog the game down. If you want 
quicker combats, at the risk of those combats becoming 
unbalanced, try using the side initiative rule. 
Under this variant, the players roll a d20 for their 
initiative as a group, or side. You also roll a d20. Neither 
roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins 
initiative. In case of a tie, keep rerolling until the tie 
is broken. 
When it's a side's turn, the members of that side can 
act in any order they choose. Once everyone on the side 
has taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends 
when both sides have completed their turns. 
If more than two sides take part in a battle, each side 
rolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to 
lowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the 
battle is complete. 
This variant encourages teamwork and makes your 
life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate 
monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative 
can gang up on enemies and take them out before they 
have a chance to act. 
SPEED FACTOR 
Some DMs find the regular progression of initiative 
too predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use 
their knowledge of the initiative order to influence their 
decisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might 
charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes 
before the monster and can heal him. 
Speed factor is an option for initiative that introduces 
more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of 
play. Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll 
initiative each round. Before rolling, each character or 
monster must choose an action.

Initiative Modifiers. Modifiers might apply to a 
-eature's initiative depending on its size and the action 
- rakes. For example, a creature that fights with a light 
eapon or casts a simple spell is more likely to act 
fore a creature armed with a heavy or slow weapon. 
:ee the Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers table for 
: rails. If an action has no modifier listed, the action has 
-
effect on initiative. If more than one modifier applies 
such as wielding a two-handed, heavy melee weapon), 
.ipply them all to the initiative roll.

Initiative Modifier

+0

-5 
- 8 
Don't apply the same modifier more than once on a 
creature's turn. For example, a rogue fighting with two 
daggers gains the +2 bonus for using a light or finesse 
weapon only once. In the case of spellcasting, apply only 
the modifier from the highest-level spell. 
Apply any modifiers for bonus actions to that 
creature's turn, remembering never to apply the 
same modifier twice. For instance, a paladin casts a 
2nd-level spell as a bonus action and then attacks with a 
-hortsword. The paladin takes a -2 penalty for the spell 
and gains a +2 bonus for using a light weapon, for a total 
modifier of +0. 
The table is only a starting point. You can refer to it 
when adjudicating any actions a character takes that 
you think should be faster or slower. Quick, easy actions 
hould grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should 
incur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or 
penalty of 2 or 5 for an action. 
For example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to raise a 
portcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could 
rule that it incurs a -5 initiative penalty. 
Rolling Initiative. After deciding on an action, 
everyone rolls initiative and applies modifiers, keeping 
rhe result secret. You then announce an initiative 
number, starting with 30 and working down (it helps to 
call out ranges of numbers at the start). Break any ties 
by having the combatant with the highest Dexterity act 
first. Otherwise, roll to determine who goes first. 
Turns. On its turn, a creature moves as normal but 
must take the action it selected or take no action at all. 
Once everyone has acted, the process repeats. 
Everyone in the battle selects an action. rolls initiative, 
and takes turns in order. 
ACTION OPTIONS 
This section provides new action options for combat. 
They can be added as a group or individually to 
your game. 
CLIMB ONTO A BIGGER CREATURE 
If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it 
can do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has 
little chance of making a successful grapple against a 
Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic 
has granted the grappler supernatural might. 
As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be 
treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its 
back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability 
checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger 
creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make 
a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check 
contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully 
moves into the target creature's space and clings to its 
body. While in the target's space, the smaller creature 
moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls 
against it. 
The smaller creature can move around within the 
larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult 
terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the 
smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's 
location, and is left to your discretion. The larger 
creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an 
action- knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, 
or grabbing and throwing it- by making a Strength 
(Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
The smaller creature chooses which ability to use. 
DISARM 
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon 
or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker 
makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength 
(Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the 
attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage 
or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item. 
The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if 
the target is holding the item with two or more hands. 
The target has advantage on its ability check if it is 
larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it 
is smaller. 
MARK 
This option makes it easier for melee combatants to 
harry each other with opportunity attacks. 
When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also 
mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, 
any opportunity attack it makes against the marked 
target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't 
expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't 
make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated 
condition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it 
from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one 
opportunity attack per turn.
