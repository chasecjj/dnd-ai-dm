THE 
EM ENTAL 
PLANES 
~rave lers who know the strange tides and currents 
of the plane can travel between worlds freely, but the 
5 orms also wreck ships from the Material Plane on the 
- and's shore. 
The region of the Plane of Water nearest the Swamp 
of Oblivion (on the Plane of Earth) is called the Silt 
Flats. The water is thick with soil and sludge, and turns 
.mo muddy ground before giving way to the great swamp 
between the planes. 
At the other extreme of the plane is the Sea oflce, 
bordering the Frostfell. The frigid water is choked with 
cebergs and sheet ice, inhabited by the cold-loving 
creatures that inhabit the Frostfell. Drifting icebergs 
can carry these creatures farther into the Plane of 
'Yater to threaten ships and islands in warmer seas. 
The Frostfell, also called the Plane of Ice, forms the 
border between the planes of Air and Water and is a 
seemingly endless glacier swept by constant, raging 
blizzards. Frozen caverns twist through the Plane of 
Ice, home to yetis, remorhazes, white dragons, and other 
creatures of cold. The inhabitants of the plane engage in 
a never-ending battle to prove their strength and ensure 
their survival. 
Its dangerous monsters and bitter cold make the 
Frostfell a dangerous place to travel. Most planar 
·:oyagers keep to the air, braving the powerful winds and 
driving snow to avoid setting foot on the great glacier.

OUTER PLANES 
Streamers of noxious gas streaked that crimson dome like 
dirty clouds. They whirled to form what looked like giant 
eyes staring down, eyes that were swept away before they 
couldfocus, only to form anew, again and again. Beneath 
the ruby glow lay a dark nightmare land of bare rock and 
flumes of sparks and goutingjlame, where things slithered 
and scrambled half-seen in the shadows. Mountains clawed 
the ruby sky. The Land of Teeth, Azuth had once aptly 
called it, surveying the endless jagged rocks. This was the 
Greeting Ground, the realm of horror that had claimed 
the lives of countless mortals. He was whirling along above 
Avernus, uppermost of the Nine Hells. 
-Ed Greenwood, Elminster in Hell 
If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that 
makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes provide the 
direction, thought, and purpose for its construction. 
Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as 
divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the 
Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities. 
When discussing anything to do with deities, the 
language used must be highly metaphorical. Their

actual homes aren't literally places at all, but exemplify 
the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and 
spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine 
the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a border 
region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond 
ordinary sensory experience. 
Even in perceptible regions, appearances can be 
deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear 
hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. 
But the landscape can change at a whim of the powerful 
forces that dwell on these planes, which can remake 
them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding 
existence to better fulfill their divine needs. 
Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the 
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes can 
seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what 
seems like infinity. Adventurers could take a guided 
tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, 
in a single day- if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it 
could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek 
across a single layer. 
The default Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes 
that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding 
neutrality, which is represented by the Outlands, 
described in the section on "Other Planes") and the 
shades of distinction between them.

The planes with an element of good in their nature are 
called the Upper Planes, while those with an element 
of evil are the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is 
its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't 
match the plane's alignment experiences a sense of 
dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, 
for example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an 
evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little 
uncomfortable. 
The Upper Planes are the home of celestial creatures, 
including angels, couatls, and pegasi. The Lower Planes 
are the home of fiends: demons, devils, yugoloths, 
and their ilk. The planes in between host their own 
unique denizens: the construct race of modrons

inhabit Mechanus, and the aberrations called slaadi 
thrive in Limbo. 
LAYERS OF THE O UTER PLANES 
Most of the Outer Planes include a number of distinct 
environments or realms. These realms are often 
imagined and depicted as a stack of related parts of the 
same plane, so travelers refer to them as layers. For 
example, Mount Celestia resembles a seven-tiered layer 
cake, the Nine Hells has nine layers, and the Abyss has 
a seemingly endless number of layers. 
Most portals from elsewhere reach the first layer of a 
multilayered plane. This layer is variously depicted as 
the top or bottom layer, depending on the plane. As the 
arrival point for most visitors, the first layer functions 
like a city gate for that plane. 
TRAVELING THE OUTER PLANES 
Traveling between the Outer Planes isn't dissimilar 
from reaching the Outer Planes in the first place. 
Characters traveling by means of the astral projection 
spell can go from one plane into the Astral Plane, and 
there search out a color pool leading to the desired 
destination. Characters can also use plane shift to reach 
a different plane more directly. Most often, though, 
characters use portals- either a portal that links the two 
planes directly or a portal leading to Sigil, City of Door . 
which holds portals to all the planes. 
Two planar features connect multiple Outer Planes 
together: the River Styx and the Infinite Staircase. 
Other planar crossings might exist in your campaign, 
such as a World Tree whose roots touch the Lower 
Planes and whose branches reach to the Upper Planes. 
or it might be possible to walk from one plane to another 
in your cosmology. 
THE RIVER STYX 
This river bubbles with grease, foul flotsam, and 
the putrid remains of battles along its banks. Any 
creature other than a fiend that tastes or touches the 
water ·is affected by a feeblemind spell. The DC of the 
Intelligence saving throw to resist the effect is 15. 
The Styx churns through the top layers of Acheron, 
the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and 
Pandemonium. Tributaries of the Styx snake onto lower 
layers of these planes. For example, a tendril of the Styx 
winds through every layer of the Nine Hells, allowing 
passage from one layer of that plane to the next. 
Sinister ferries float on the waters of the Styx, crewed 
by pilots skilled in negotiating the unpredictable 
currents and eddies of the river. For a price, these pilots 
are willing to carry passengers from plane to plane. 
Some of them are fiends, while others are the souls of 
dead creatures from the Material Plane. 
THE INFINITE STAIRCASE 
The Infinite Staircase is an extradimensional spiral 
staircase that connects the planes. An entrance to the 
Infinite Staircase usually appears as a nondescript 
door. Beyond the portal lies a small landing with an 
equally nondescript stairway leading up and down. The 
Infinite Staircase changes appearance as it climbs and
