abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to 
your world, foreshadow future encounters or events, or 
provide hooks for further adventures. 
A wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to 
play out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes 
long periods with no encounters, use the travel-montage 
approach to bridge gaps between encounters. 
MAPPING A WILDERNESS 
In contrast to a dungeon, an outdoor setting presents 
seemingly limitless options. The adventurers can move 
in any direction over a trackless desert or an open 
grassland, so how do you as the DM deal with all the 
possible locations and events that might make up a 
wilderness campaign? What if you design an encounter 
in a desert oasis, but the characters miss the oasis 
because they wander off course? How do you avoid 
creating a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging 
across a rocky wasteland? 
One solution is to think of an outdoor setting in the 
same way you think about a dungeon. Even the most 
wide-open terrain presents clear pathways. Roads 
seldom run straight because they follow the contours 
of the land, finding the most level or otherwise easiest 
routes across uneven ground. Valleys and ridges 
channel travel in certain directions. Mountain ranges 
present forbidding barriers traversed only by remote 
passes. Even the most trackless desert reveals favored 
routes, where explorers and caravan drivers have 
discovered areas of wind-blasted rock that are easier to 
traverse than shifting sand. 
If the party veers off track, you might be able to 
relocate one or more of your planned encounters 
elsewhere on the map to ensure that the time spent 
preparing those encounters doesn't go to waste. 
Chapter 1 discusses the basics of creating a 
wilderness map at three different scales to help 
you design your world and the starting area of your 
campaign. Especially when you get down to province 
scale (1 hex= 1 mile), think about paths of travel- roads, 
passes, ridges and valleys, and so on-that can guide 
character movement across your map. 
MOVEMENT ON THE MAP 
Narrate wilderness travel at a level of detail appropriate 
to the map you're using. If you're tracking hour-by-hour 
movement on a province-scale map (1 hex= 1 mile), 
you can describe each hamlet the adventurers pass. 
At this scale, you can assume that the characters find 
a noteworthy location when they enter its hex unl~ ss 
the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not 
walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle when 
they enter a hex, but they can find old paths, outlying 
ruins, and other signs of its presence in the area. 
If you're tracking a journey of several days on a 
kingdom-scale map (1 hex= 6 miles), don't bother with 
details too small to appear on your map. It's enough 
for the players to know that on the third day of their 
journey, they cross a river and the land starts rising 
before them, and that they reach the mountain pass two 
days later. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS 
WILDERNESS FEATURES 
o wilderness map is complete without a few 
settlements, strongholds, ruins, and other sites worthy 
of discovery. A dozen such locations scattered over an 
area roughly 50 miles across is a good start. 
Mo STER LAIRS 
A wilderness area approximately 50 miles across can 
support roughly a half-dozen monster lairs, but probably 
no more than one apex predator such as a dragon. 
If you expect the characters to explore a monster's 
lair, you'll need to find or create an appropriate map for 
the lair and stock the lair as you would a dungeon. 
MONUMENTS 
In places where civilization rules or once ruled, 
adventurers might find monuments built to honor great 
leaders, gods, and cultures. Use the Monuments table 
for inspiration, or randomly roll to determine what 
monument the adventurers stumble upon.

RUINS 
Crumbling towers, ancient temples, and razed cities 
are perfect sites for adventures. Additionally, noting the 
existence of an old, crumbling wall that runs alongside a 
road, a sagging stone windmill on a hilltop, or a jumble 
of standing stones can add texture to your wilderness. 
SETTLEMENTS 
Settlements exist in places where food, water, farmland, 
and building materials are abundant. A civilized 
province roughly 50 miles across might have one city, a 
few rural towns, and a scattering of villages and trading 
posts. An uncivilized area might have a single trading 
post that stands at the edge of a wild frontier, but no 
larger settlements. 
In addition to settlements, a province might contain 
ruined villages and towns that are either abandoned or 
serve as lairs for marauding bandits and monsters.
