A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as 
the person who wrote it and offer no benefit in places 
where its writer holds no sway. 
MEDALS 
Although they are often fash ioned from gold and 
other precious materials, medals have an even greater 
symbolic value to those who award and receive them. 
Medals are typically awarded by powerful political 
figures for acts of heroism, and wearing a medal 
is usually enough to earn the respect of those who 
understand its significance. 
Different acts of heroism can warrant different 
kinds of medals. The King of Breland (in the Eberron 
campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor 
(shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum) 
to adventurers for defending Brei ish citizens, while 
the Golden Bear of Breland (a medal made of gold and 
shaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems for 
eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their 
allegiance to the Brelish Crown by uncovering and 
defeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and 
reignite the Last War. 
A medal doesn't offer a specific in-game benefit to one 
who wears it, but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For 
example, a character who proudly displays the Golden 
Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people 
within the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the 
medal carries far less weight, except among allies of 
Breland's king. 
PARCELS OF LAND 
A parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a 
royal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a 
reward for some service. Such land usually remains the 
property of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased 
to a character with the understanding that it can be 
taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called 
into question. 
A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or 
more farms or villages on it already, in which case the 
recipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is 
expected to collect taxes, along with any other duties. 
A character who receives a parcel of land is free to 
build on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she may 
yield the land as part of an inheritance, but can't sell 
or trade it without permission from the local ruler or 
ruling body. 
Parcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers 
who are looking for a place to settle or who have family 
or some kind of personal investment in the region where 
the land is located. 
SPECIAL FAVORS 
A reward might come in the form of a favor that the 
characters can call on at some future date. Special 
favors work best when the individual granting them is 
trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will 
do whatever can be done to fulfill an obligation when 
the time comes, short of breaking laws. A lawful evil 
NPC does the same, but only because a deal is a deal. 
A neutral good or neutral PC might pay off favors to 
protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is
