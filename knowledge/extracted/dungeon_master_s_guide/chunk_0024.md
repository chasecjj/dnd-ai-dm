9. PREDICTION' OMEN' PROPHECY 
Sometimes the foretelling of a world-shaking event 
becomes a world-shaking event: an omen that predicts 
the fall of empires, the doom of races, and the end 
of the world. Sometimes an omen points to change 
for the good, such as the arrival of a legendary hero 
or savior. But the most dramatic prophecies warn of 
future tragedies and predict dark ages. Unlike other 
world-shaking events, the outcome doesn't happen 
immediately. Instead, individuals or factions strive to 
fulfill or avert the prophecy-or shape the exact way it 
will be fulfilled- according to how it will affect them. 
The prophecy's helpers or hinderers create adventure 
hooks in the campaign by the actions they take. A 
prophecy should foretell a big event on a grand scale, 
since it will take time to come true (or be averted). 
Imagine that a world-shaking prophecy comes to light. 
If events continue on their present course, the prophecy 
will come true and the world will change dramatically 
as a result. Don't shy away from making this prophecy 
both significant and alarming, keeping in mind the 
following points: 
Create a prophecy that foretells a major change to 
the campaign world. You can build one from scratch 
using ideas from the current campaign or randomly 
determine a world-shaking event and fl~sh out 
the details. 
Write a list of three or more omens that will occur 
before the prophecy comes to pass. You can use 
events that have already occurred in the campaign so 
that the prophecy is closer to being fulfilled. The rest 
are events that might or might not happen, depending 
on the actions of the characters. 
Describe the person or creature that discovered 
the prophecy and how it was found. What did this 
creature gain by revealing it? What did this person 
lose or sacrifice? 
• Describe the individual or faction that supports the 
prophecy and works to ensure its fulfillment, and the 
one that will do all in its power to avert the prophecy. 
What is the first step each takes? Who suffers for 
their efforts? 
One part of the prophecy is wrong. Choose one of the 
omens you listed or one of the details you created for 
the world-shaking event that the omen predicts. The 
chosen omen is false, and if applicable, its opposite is 
true instead. 
10. MYTH AND LEGEND 
If wars, plagues, discoveries, and the like can be called 
regular world-shaking events, mythic events exceed 
and surpass them. A mythic event might occur as the 
fulfillment of an ancient or long-forgotten prophecy, or it 
might be an act of divine intervention. 
Once again, your current campaign probably provides 
a few ideas for the shape of this event. If you need 
inspiration, roll a d8 on the World-Shaking Events table, 
instead of the normal dlO. Address the bullet-point 
notes for that disaster, but magnify the result to the 
grandest scale you can imagine. 
CHAPTER 1 j A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
The rise or fall of a leader or era is the death or 
birth of a god, or the end of an age or the world. A 
cataclysmic disaster is a world-drowning deluge, an ice 
age, or a zombie apocalypse. An assault or invasion is 
a world war, a world-spanning demonic incursion, the 
awakening of a world-threatening monster, or the final 
clash between good and evil. A rebellion dethrones a 
god or gods, or raises a new force (such as a demon 
lord) to divinity. A new organization is a world-spanning 
empire or a pantheon of new gods. A discovery is a 
doomsday device or a portal to eldritch dimensions 
where world-shattering cosmic horrors dwell. 
TRACKING TIME 
A calendar lets you record the passage of time in the 
campaign. More importantly, it lets you plan ahead for 
the critical events that shake up the world. For simple 
time tracking, use a calendar for the current year in 
the real world. Pick a date to indicate the start of the 
campaign, and make note of the days that adventurers 
spend on their travels and various activities. The 
calendar tells you when the seasons change and 
the lunar cycle. More importantly, you can use your 
calendar to track important festivals and holidays, as 
well as key events that shape your campaign. 
This method is a good starting point, but the calendar 
of your world need not follow a modern calendar. If you 
want to customize your calendar with details unique to 
your world, consider these types of features. 
THE BASICS 
A fantasy world's calendar doesn't have to mirror the 
modern one, but it can (see "The Calendar of Harptos" 
sidebar for an example). Do the weeks of a month have 
names? What about specific days of each month, like the 
ides, nones, and calends of the Roman calendar? 
PHYSICAL CYCLES 
Determine when the seasons fall, marked by the 
solstices and equinoxes. Do the months correspond 
to the phases of the moon (or moons)? Do strange 
and magical effects occur at the same time as these 
phenomena? 
RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES 
Sprinkle holy days throughout your calendar. Each 
significant deity in your world should have at least one 
holy day during the year, and some gods' holy days 
correspond to celestial phenomena such as new moons 
or equinoxes. Holy days reflect the portfolio of a deity (a 
god of agriculture is honored in the harvest season) or 
significant events in the history of the deity's worship, 
such as the birth or death of a holy person, the date of 
a god's manifestation, the accession of the current high 
priest, and so on. 
Certain holy days are civic events, observed by every 
citizen of a town where a god's temple can be found. 
Harvest festivals are often celebrations on a grand 
scale. Other holy days are important only to people 
particularly devoted to a single deity. Still others are 
observed by priests, who perform private rites and 
sacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific
