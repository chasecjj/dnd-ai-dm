action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres 
of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less 
powerful each sphere is individually.

you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 
minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.

taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
RING OF SPELL STORING 
Ring, rare (requires attunement) 
This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the 
attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 
levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contain 
ld6 - I levels of stored spells chosen by the DM. 
Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level 
into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. 
The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the 
ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expendec 
without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spel! 
determines how much space it uses. 
While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored 
in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell 
attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original 
caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. 
The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, 
freeing up space.
