For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by 
the number of hours traveled (typically 8 hours). 
For a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by one-third. 
For a slow pace, multiply the rate by two-thirds. 
For example, a character under the effect of a wind 
walk spell gains a flying speed of 300 feet. In 1 minute, 
the character can move 3,000 feet at a normal pace, 
4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at a slow pace. 
The character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an 
hour. The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character 
to travel 160, 240, or 320 miles in a day. 
Similarly, a phantom steed spell creates a magical 
mount with a speed of 100 feet that doesn't tire like a 
real horse. A character on a phantom steed can cover 
1,000 feet in 1 minute at a normal pace, 1,333 feet at 
a fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace. In 1 hour, the 
character can travel 7, 10, or 13 miles. 
VISIBILITY OUTDOORS 
When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 
miles in any direction on a clear day, or until the point 
where trees, hills, or other obstructions block their view. 
Rain normally cuts maximum visibility down to 1 mile, 
and fog can cut it down to between 100 and 300 feet. 
On a clear day, the characters can see 40 miles if they 
are atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able 
to look down on the area around them from a height. 
NOTICING OTHER CREATURES 
While exploring, characters might encounter other 
creatures. An important question in such a situation is 
who notices whom. 
Indoors, whether the sides can see one another 
usually depends on the configuration of rooms and 
passageways. Vision might also be limited by light 
sources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain, 
weather, and time of day. Creatures can be more likely 
to hear one another before they see anything. 
If neither side is being stealthy, creatures 
automatically notice each other once they are within 
sight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise, 
compare the Dexterity (Stealth) check results of the 
creatures in the group that is hiding with the passive 
Wisdom (Perception) scores of the other group, as 
explained in the Player's Handbook.

TRACKING 
Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following 
the tracks of other creatures-or other creatures might 
track the adventurers! To track, one or more creatures 
must succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check. You might 
require trackers to make a new check in any of the 
following circumstances: 
• They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short 
or long rest. 
The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that 
shows no tracks. 
• The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way 
that makes tracking harder. 
The DC for the check depends on how well the ground 
shows signs of a creature's passage. No roll is necessary 
in situations where the tracks are obvious. For example, 
no check is needed to track an army advancing along 
a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is 
more challenging, unless the creature being tracked 
leaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time 
often makes tracks harder to follow. In a situation where 
there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is 
impossible. 
The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting 
the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on 
your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant 
advantage on the check if there's more than one set 
of tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the trail being 
followed passes through a well-trafficked area. 
On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can 
attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the 
area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail in a confined area 
such as a dungeon, or 1 hour outdoors.

SOCIAL INTERACTION 
During a social interaction, the adventurers usually have 
a goal. They want to extract information, secure aid, 
win someone's trust, escape punishment, avoid combat, 
negotiate a treaty, or achieve whatever other objective 
led to the interaction in the first place. The creatures 
they interact with also have agendas. 
Some DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a 
free-form roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come 
into play. Other DMs prefer to resolve the outcome of 
an interaction by having characters make Charisma 
checks. Either approach works, and most games 
fall somewhere in between, balancing player skill 
(roleplaying and persuading) with character skill 
(reflected by ability checks). 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 
RESOLVING INTERACTIONS ------
The Player's Handbook provides guidelines for 
balancing roleplaying and ability checks in a social 
interaction (see chapter 8, "Adventuring," in that book . 
This section adds to that material by providing a 
structured way to resolve a social interaction. Much of 
this structure will be invisible to your players in play aD: 
isn't meant to be a substitute for roleplaying. 
l. STARTING ATTITUDE 
Choose the starting attitude of a creature the 
adventurers are interacting with: friendly, indifferent. 
or hostile. 
A friendly creature wants to help the adventurers 
and wishes for them to succeed. For tasks or actions 
that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly 
creatures usually help without question. If an element 
personal risk is involved, a successful Charisma check 
might be required to convince a friendly creature to take 
that risk. 
An indifferent creature might help or hinder the 
party, depending on what the creature sees as most 
beneficial. A creature's indifference doesn't necessarily 
make it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent 
creatures might be polite and genial, surly and irritable 
or anything in between. A successful Charisma check 
is necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an 
indifferent creature to do something. 
A hostile creature opposes the adventurers and their 
goals but doesn't necessarily attack them on sight. 
For example, a condescending noble might wish to 
see a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep 
them from becoming rivals for the king's attention, 
thwarting them with slander and scheming rather than 
direct threats and violence. The adventurers need to 
succeed on one or more challenging Charisma checks 
to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their 
behalf. That said, a hostile creature might be so ill-
disposed toward the party that no Charisma check can 
improve its attitude, in which case any attempt to sway i· 
through diplomacy fails automatically. 
2. CONVERSATION 
Play out the conversation. Let the adventurers make 
their points, trying to frame their statements in 
terms that are meaningful to the creature they are 
interacting with. 
Changing Attitude. The attitude of a creature 
might change over the course of a conversation. If 
the adventurers say or do the right things during 
an interaction (perhaps by touching on a creature's 
ideal, bond, or flaw), they can make a hostile creature 
temporarily indifferent, or make an indifferent creature 
temporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe, insult, or harmful 
deed might make a friendly creature temporarily 
indifferent or turn an indifferent creature hostile. 
Whether the adventurers can shift a creature's 
attitude is up to you. You decide whether the adventurer 
have successfully couched their statements in terms 
that matter to the creature. Typically, a creature's 
attitude can't shift more than one step during a single 
interaction, whether temporarily or permanently.
