Rise of a Leader, Beginning of an Era. In dramatic 
stories, a new leader's rise often comes at the end of 
a period of struggle or turmoil. Sometimes it's a war 
or uprising; other times it's an election, the death of a 
tyrant, a prophecy fulfilled, or the appointment of a hero. 
Conversely, the new leader might be a tyrant, a fiend, or 
black-hearted villain, and the era that just ended could 
have been one of peace, tranquility, and justice. 
A new leader shakes the foundations of your campaign 
world and begins a new era in the selected region. How 
does this person or this era begin to affect the world? 
Here are several things to consider when determining 
the leader's impact on the world: 
• Name one thing that has been consistently true about 
the world, which is now no longer true due to this 
leader's rise or influence. This is the biggest change 
that occurs when the new leader takes power and 
becomes the prevailing trait that defines the era, the 
characteristic for which it is remembered. 
• Name the person (or people) whose death, defeat, or 
loss opened the door for this leader to take power. 
This might be a military defeat, the overthrow of 
old ideas, a cultural rebirth, or something else. Who 
died, lost, or was defeated? What weren't they willing 
to compromise? Was the new leader complicit in 
the death, defeat, or loss, or was the opportunity 
serendipitous? 
• Despite the leader's virtues, one flaw in particular 
outrages a certain segment of the populace. What 
is that flaw? What person or group of persons will 
do their utmost to foil this leader because of it? 
Conversely, what is this leader's greatest virtue, and 
who rises to the leader's defense because of it? 
• Who believes in this leader now, but still retains 
doubts? This is someone close to the leader, who has 
the leader's trust and knows his or her secret fears, 
doubts, or vices. 
FaJJ of a Leader, End of an Era. All that begins must 
end. With the fall of kings and queens, the maps of the 
world are redrawn. Laws change, new customs become 
all the rage, and old ones fall out of favor. The attitude 
of the citizens toward their fallen leader shifts subtly at 
first and then changes dramatically as they look back or 
reminisce about the time before. 
The fallen leader might have been a benevolent 
ruler, an influential citizen, or even an adversary to the 
characters. How does the death of this person affect 
those formerly under his or her influence? ijere are 
several things to consider when determining the effects 
of a leader's passing: 
• Name one positive change that the leader brought to 
his or her domain or sphere of influence. Does that 
change persist after the leader's death? 
State the general mood or attitude of the people under 
this person's power. What important fact didn't they 
realize about this person or his or her reign, which 
will later come to light? 
Name one person or group that tries to fill the leader's 
shoes in the resulting power vacuum. 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
Name one person or group that plotted against 
this leader. 
Name three things for which this leader will be 
remembered. 
3. CATACLYSMIC DISASTER 
Earthquake, famine, fire, plague, flood- disasters on a 
grand scale can eradicate whole civilizations without 
warning. Natural (or magical) catastrophes redraw 
maps, destroy economies, and alter worlds. Sometimes 
the survivors rebuild from the ruins. The Great Chicago 
Fire, for instance, provided an opportunity to rebuild 
the city according to a modern plan. Most of the time 
the disaster leaves only ruins- buried under ash like 
Pompeii, or sunk beneath the waves like Atlantis. 
You can choose the cataclysm or determine one 
randomly using the Cataclysmic Disasters table.

Divine judgment 
Some of the disasters on the table might not make 
immediate sense in the context of your campaign 
world. A flood in the desert? A volcanic eruption on 
grassy plains? If you randomly determine a disaster 
that conflicts with your setting, you can reroll, but the 
challenge of justifying the catastrophe can produce 
interesting results. 
With two exceptions, the disasters on the table 
resemble those that affect our own world. Think 
of planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear 
incidents; they're big events that unnaturally alter 
the land and its people. For example, in the Eberron 
campaign setting, a magical catastrophe lays waste 
to an entire country, transforming it into a hostile 
wasteland and ending the Last War. 
Divine judgment is something else entirely. This 
disaster takes whatever form you want, but it's always a 
big, bold, unsubtle sign of a deity's displeasure. 
You might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off 
the map of your world. A disaster ravages the land and 
effectively eliminates a place the characters once knew. 
Leave one or two survivors to tell the characters what 
happened, and ensure that the characters feel the depth 
of the catastrophe. What are the ongoing effects of this 
cataclysm? The following points can help you define the 
nature and consequences of the disaster: 
• Decide what caused this cataclysm and where it 
originated. 
• An omen presaged this event, or a series of signs and 
omens. Describe the omen in detail.
