an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have

R oD OF ABSORPTION 
Rod, very rare (requires attunement) 
While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to 
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an 
area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, 
and the spell's energy- not the spell itself- is stored in 
the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when 
it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels 
of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod 
absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you 
are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod 
has no effect on that spell. 
When you become attuned to the rod, you know how 
many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the 
course of its existence, and how many levels of spell 
energy it currently has stored. 
If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can 
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells 
you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots 
only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell
