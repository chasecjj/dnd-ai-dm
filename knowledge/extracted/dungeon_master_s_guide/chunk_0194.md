CREATURE SIZE ON SQUARES A 
D HEXES 
A creature's size determines how much space it 
occupies on squares or hexes, as shown in the Creature 
Size and Space table. If the miniature you use for a 
monster takes up an amount of space different from 
what's on the table, that's fine, but treat the monster 
as its official size for all other rules. For example, 
you might use a miniature that has a Large base to 
represent a Huge giant. That giant takes up less space 
on the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still 
Huge for the purposes of rules like grappling.

A REAS OF EFFECT 
The area of effect of a spell, monster ability, or other 
feature must be translated onto squares or hexes to 
determine which potential targets are in the area and 
which aren't. 
Choose an intersection of squares or hexes as the 
point of origin of an area of effect, then follow its rules 
as normal. If an area of effect is circular and covers at 
least half a square, it affects that square. 
L INE OF SIGHT 
To precisely determine whether there is line of sight 
between two spaces, pick a corner of one space and 
rrace an imaginary line from that corner to any part 
of another space. If at least one such line doesn't pass 
through or touch an object or effect that blocks vision-
such as a stone wall, a thick curtain, or a dense cloud of 
fog-then there is line of sight. 
C OVER 
To determine whether a target has cover against an 
attack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the 
anacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect. 
Then trace imaginary lines from that corner to every 
corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or 
two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including 
another creature), the target has half cover. If three or 
four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still 
reach the target (such as when the target is behind an 
arrow slit), the target has three-quarters cover. 
On hexes, use the same procedure as a grid, drawing 
lines between the corners of the hexagons. The target 
has half cover if up to three lines are blocked by an 
obstacle, and three-quarters cover if four or more lines 
are blocked but the attack can still reach the target. 
OPTIONAL RULE : FLANKING 
If you regularly use miniatures, flanking gives 
combatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack 
rolls against a common enemy. 
A creature can't flank an enemy that it can't see. A 
creature also can't flank while it is incapacitated. A 
Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least 
one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking. 
Flanking on Squares. When a creature and at 
least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on 
opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they 
flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on 
melee attack rolls against that enemy. 
When in doubt about whether two creatures flank 
an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between 
the centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes 
through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, 
the enemy is flanked. 
Flanking on Hexes. When a creature and at least one 
of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite 
sides of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and 
each of them has advantage on attack rolls against 
that enemy. On hexes, count around the enemy from 
one creature to its ally. Against a Medium or smaller 
creature, the allies flank if there are 2 hexes between 
them. Against a Large creature, the allies flank if there 
are 4 hexes between them. Against a Huge creature, 
they must have 5 hexes between them. Against a 
Gargantuan creature, they must have at least 6 hexes 
between them.
