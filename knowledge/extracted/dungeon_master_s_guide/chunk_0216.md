If you want to take an NPC stat block and adapt it for 
a specific monster race, apply the ability modifiers and 
add the features listed in the NPC Features table. If the 
NPC's AC, hit points, attack bonus, or damage changes, 
recalculate its challenge rating. 
• You can create an NPC stat block (similar to the ones 
in the Monster Manual) as you would a monster stat 
block, as discussed in the previous section. 
You can build the NPC as you would a player 
character, as discussed in the Player's Handbook. 
CREATING NPCs FROM SCRATCH 
If you decide to build an NPC the same way you build 
a player character, you can skip choosing a background 
and instead pick two skill proficiencies for the NPC. 
If you need completely new statistics for an NPC, you 
have two options:
