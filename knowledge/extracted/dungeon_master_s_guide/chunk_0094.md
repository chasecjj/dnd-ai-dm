Chapter 8, ··Adventuring:· of the Player· Handbook 
describes a few downtime activities to fill the Yoid 
between adventures. Depending on the style of your 
campaign and the particular backgrounds and interests 
of the adventurers, you can make some or all of the 
following additional activities available as options. 
B U I LDING A STRONGHOLD 
A character can spend time between adventures 
building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the 
character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies 
within a kingdom or similar domain, the character 
will need a royal charter (a legal document granting 
permission to oversee the estate in the name of the 
crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing 
custody of the land to the character for as long as he 
or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal 
document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can 
also be acquired by inheritance or other means. 
Royal charters and land grants are usually given by 
the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they 
can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A 
small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much 
as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, 
if it can be bought at all. 
Once the estate is secured, a character needs access 
to building materials and laborers. The Building 
a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the 
stronghold (including materials and labor) and the 
amount of time it takes, provided that the character 
is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can 
continue while the character is away, but each day the 
character is away adds 3 days to the construction time.

CAROUSING 
Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a 
variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, 
binge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps 
them cope with the perils they face on their adventures. 
A carousing character spends money as though 
maintaining a wealthy lifestyle (see chapter 5, 
"Equipment," of the Player's Handbook). At the end of 
the period spent carousing, the player rolls percentile 
dice and adds the character's level, then compares the 
total to the Carousing table to determine what happens 
to the character, or you choose.

CRAFTING A MAGIC ITEM 
Magic items are the DM's purview, so you decide how 
they fall into the party's possession. As an option, you 
can allow player characters to craft magic items. 
The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive 
task. To start, a character must have a formula that 
describes the construction of the item. The character 
must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must 
be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. 
Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum 
determined by the item's rarity, as shown in the Crafting 
Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character 
could create a wand of magic missiles (an uncommon 
item), as long as the character has spell slots and can
