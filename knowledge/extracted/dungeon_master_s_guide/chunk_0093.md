r·s not unusual for adventurers- especially after lOth 
·e)-to gain possession of a castle, a tavern, or another 
_ ·ece of property. They might buy it with their hard-won 
r, take it by force, obtain it in a lucky draw from a 
: 
k of many things, or acquire it by other means. 
The Maintenance Costs table shows the per-day 
_ keep cost for any such property. (The cost of a 
rmal residence isn't included here because it falls 
der lifestyle expenses, as discussed in the Player's 
=!andbook.) Maintenance expenses need to be paid 
ery 30 days. Given that adventurers spend much of 
· eir time adventuring, staff includes a steward who can 
- ake payments in the party's absence. 
Total Cost per Day. The cost includes everything it 
- ·es to maintain the property and keep things running 
-:noothly, including the salaries of hirelings. If the 
::-operty earns money that can offset maintenance costs 
y charging fees, collecting tithes or donations, or 
: lling goods), that is taken into account in the table. 
Skilled and Untrained Hirelings. The Player's 
F-fandbook explains the difference between a skilled

-.n adventurer-owned business can earn enough money 
- cover its own maintenance costs. However, the 
-;vner needs to periodically ensure that everything is 
-unning smoothly by tending to the business between 
_ ventures. See the information on running a business 
rhe "Downtime Activities" section of this chapter. 
~ARRISONS 
::.:astles and keeps employ soldiers (use the veteran 
and guard statistics in the Monster Manual) to defend 
- em. Roadside inns, outposts and forts, palaces, and 
·emples rely on less-experienced defenders (use the 
;;uard statistics in the Monster Manual). These armed 
arriors make up the bulk of a property's skilled 
'lirelings. 
DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES 
The campaign benefits when characters have time 
between adventures to engage in other activities. 
Allowing days, weeks, or months to pass between 
adventures stretches the campaign over a longer period 
of time and helps to manage the characters' level 
progression, preventing them from gaining too much 
power too quickly. 
Allowing characters to pursue side interests between 
adventures also encourages players to become more 
invested in the campaign world. When a character owns 
a tavern in a village or spends time carousing with the 
locals, that character's player is more likely to respond 
to threats to the village and its inhabitants. 
As your campaign progresses, your players' 
characters will not only become more powerful but also 
more influential and invested in the world. They might 
be inclined to undertake projects that require more time 
between adventures, such as building and maintaining a 
stronghold. As the party gains levels, you can add more 
downtime between adventures to give characters the 
time they need to pursue such interests. Whereas days 
or weeks might pass between low-level adventures, the 
amount of downtime between higher-level adventures 
might be measured in months or years.
