ENDING A CHASE 
A chase ends when one side or the other tops, when the 
quarry escapes, or when the pursuer are close enough 
to their quarry to catch it. 
If neither side gives up the cha e. the quarry makes a 
Dexterity (Stealth) check at the end of each round, after 
every participant in the chase ha taken its turn. The 
result is compared to the passive\ isdom (Perception) 
scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple 
creatures, they all make the check. 
If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer's sight, 
the check fails automatically. Otherwise, if the result of 
the quarry's check is greater than the highest passive 
score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues 
for another round. 
The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its 
check based on prevailing circumstances, as shown in 
the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the 
quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check, 
the quarry has neither, as usual.

Other factors might help or hinder the quarry's ability 
to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with 
a faerie fire spell cast on it might have disadvantage on 
checks made to escape because it's much easier to spot. 
Escape doesn't necessarily mean the quarry has 
outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban 
setting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a 
crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to 
where it went. 
CHASE COMPLICATIONS 
As with any good chase scene, complications can arise 
to make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban 
Chase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase 
Complications table provide several examples. 
Complications occur randomly. Each participant in 
the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the 
appropriate table to determine whether a complication 
occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in 
the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the 
die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant 
affected by the complication can spend inspiration to 
negate the complication.

Characters can create their own complications to 
shake off pursuers (for example, casting the web spell in 
a narrow alleyway). Adjudicate these as you see fit.

DESIGNING YouR OwN CHASE TABLES 
The tables presented here don't work for all possible 
environments. A chase through the sewers of 
Baldur's Gate or through the spiderweb-filled alleys 
of Menzoberranzan might inspire you to create your 
own table. 
SPLITTING UP 
Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. 
This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces
