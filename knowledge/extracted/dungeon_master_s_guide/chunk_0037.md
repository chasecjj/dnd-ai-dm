ASTRAL PLANE ENCOUNTERS 
Planar travelers and refugees from other planes wander 
the expanses of the Astral Plane. The most prominent 
denizens of the Astral Plane are the githyanki, an 
outcast race of reavers that sail sleek astral ships, 
slaughter astral travelers, and raid planes touched 
by the AstraL Their city, Tu'narath, floats through the 
Astral Plane on a chunk of rock that is actually the body 
of a dead god. 
Celestials, fiends, and mortal explorers often scour 
the Astral Plane for color pools leading to desired 
destinations. Characters who linger for too long 
in the Astral might have an encounter with one or 
more wandering angels, demons, devils, night hags, 
yugoloths, or other planar travelers. 
ETHEREAL PLANE 
Tamlinfelt a hand on him, felt his body shimmer into 
mist The screams and shouts sounded far off- The walls 
around him appeared to be only gray shadows. Rival en 
and Brenn us stood beside him. 
"The ethereal plane," Rivalen said. "The dragon's breath 
cannot affect us here." 
- PaulS. Kemp, Shadowstorm 
The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension. 
Its "shores," called the Border Ethereal, overlap the 
Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every 
location on those planes has a corresponding location 
on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal 
is limited to 60 feet The plane's depths comprise a 
region of swirling mist and fog called the Deep EthereaL 
where visibility is limited to 30 feet 
Characters can use the etherealness spell to enter 
the Border EthereaL The plane shift spell allows 
transport to the Border Ethereal or the Deep Ethereal, 
but unless the intended destination is a specific location 
or a teleportation circle, the point of arrival could be 
anywhere on the plane. 
BORDER ETHEREAL 
------
From the Border Ethereal, a traveler can see into 
whatever plane it overlaps, but that plane appears muted 
and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and 
its edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens watch the 
plane as though peering through distorted and frosted 
glass, and can't see anything beyond 30 feet into the 
other plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually 
invisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with 
the aid of magic. 
-Normally, creatures in the Border Ethereal can't 
attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice 
versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and 
utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and 
solid objects on the overlapped plane don't hamper 
the movement of a creature in the Border EthereaL 
The exceptions are certain magical effects (including 
anything made of magical force) and living beings. This 
makes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissance, 
spying on opponents, and moving around without being 
detected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws 
of gravity; a creature there can move up and down as 
easily as walking. 
DEEP ETHEREAL 
-------
To reach the Deep Ethereal, one needs a plane shift 
spell or arrive by means of a gate spell or magical portaL 
Visitors to the Deep Ethereal are engulfed by roiling 
mist Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of 
vaporous color, and passing through a curtain leads a 
traveler to a region of the Border Ethereal connected to 
a specific Inner Plane, the Material Plane, the Feywild. 
or the ShadowfelL The color of the curtain indicates the 
plane whose Border Ethereal the curtain conceals; see 
the Ethereal Curtains table.
