CREATING A BACKGROUND 
A well-crafted background can help a player create a 
character that feels like an exciting addition to your 
campaign. It helps define the character's place in the 
world, rather than what a character is in terms of game 
mechanics. 
Instead of focusing on a generic character 
background, such as merchant or wanderer, think 
about the factions, organizations, and cultures of 
your campaign and how they might be leveraged to 
create flavorful backgrounds for player characters. For 
example, you could create an acolyte of Candlekeep 
background that is functionally similar to a sage 
background, but which ties a character more closely to a 
place and organization in your world. 
A character with the acolyte of Candlekeep 
background probably has friends among the 
Avowed-the monks who maintain the great library 
at Candlekeep. The character can enter the library 
and consult its lore freely, while others must donate 
a rare or valuable tome of knowledge before they are 
allowed entry. Candlekeep's enemies are the character's 
enemies, and its allies, the character's friends. Acolytes 
of Candlekeep are generally regarded as learned sages 
and protectors of knowledge. It's possible to envision 
many interesting interactions as NPCs discover the 
character's background and approach the character in 
search of assistance. 
To create your own background, follow these steps. 
STEP 1. ROOT lT IN YOUR WORLD 
To ground a new background in your campaign's 
setting, determine what element of your campaign the 
background is tied to: a faction. an organization, a trade, 
a person, an event, or a location. 
STEP 2. SUGGEST P ERSO NAL CHARACTERISTICS 
Create tables of suggested characteristics-personality 
traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws-that fit the background, 
or plunder entries from the tables presented in the 
Player's Handbook. Even if your players don't use 
the tables, this step helps you paint a picture of the 
background's place in your world. The tables need not 
be extensive; two or three entries per table are enough. 
STEP 3. ASSIGN PROFICIENCIES OR LANGUAGES 
Choose two skill proficiencies and two tool proficiencies 
for the background. You can replace tool proficiencies 
with languages on a one-for-one basis. 
STEP 4'. INCLUDE STARTING EQUIPMENT 
Make sure your background offers a package of starting 
equipment. In addition to a small amount of money that 
a character can use to buy adventuring gear, the starting 
equipment should include items that a character would 
have acquired prior to becoming an adventurer, as well 
as one or two items unique to the background. 
For example, starting equipment for a character with 
the acolyte of Candlekeep background might include a 
set of traveler's clothes, a scholar's robe, five candles, 
a tinderbox, an empty scroll case engraved with the 
symbol of Candlekeep, and a belt pouch containing 10 
gp. The scroll case might be a gift given to an acolyte of 
Candlekeep who embarks on a life of adventure. At your 
discretion, it might also contain a useful map. 
STEP 5. SETTLE ON A BACKGROUND FEATURE 
Choose an existing background feature or create a new 
one, as you prefer. If you choose an existing feature, add 
or tweak a few details to make it unique. 
For example, the acolyte of Candlekeep background 
might have the Researcher feature of the sage (as 
presented in the Player's Handbook), with the additional 
benefit that the character is allowed to enter Candlekeep 
without paying the normal cost. 
A background feature should avoid strict game 
benefits, such as a bonus to an ability check or an attack 
roll. Instead, the feature should open up new options for 
roleplaying, exploring, and otherwise interacting with 
the world. 
For example, the sage's Researcher feature is 
designed to send the character on adventures. It doesn't 
provide information or an automatic success for a check. 
Instead, if a character with the sage background fails 
to recall information, he or she instead knows where to 
learn it. This might be a pointer to another sage or to a 
library long lost within an ancient tomb. 
The best background features give characters 
a reason to strike out on quests, to make contact 
with NPCs, and to develop bonds to the setting 
you've devised.
