individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary 
magic items and priceless artifacts can't be sold during 
downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be 
the substance of an adventure or quest. 
For each salable item, the character makes a DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find buyers. Another 
character can use his or her downtime to assist with the 
search, granting advantage on the checks. On a failed 
check, no buyer for the item is found after a search that 
lasts 10 days. On a successful check, a buyer for the 
item is found after a number of days based on the item's 
rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Item table. 
A character can attempt to find buyers for multiple 
magic items at once. Although this requires multiple 
Intelligence (Investigation) checks, the searches a~e 
occurring simultaneously, and the results of multiple 
failures or successes aren't added together. For 
example, if the character finds a buyer for a common 
magic item in 2 days and a buyer for an uncommon item 
in 5 days, but fails to find a buyer for a rare item up for 
grabs, the entire search takes 10 days. 
For each item a character wishes to sell, the player 
rolls percentile dice and consults the Selling a Magic 
Item table, applying a modifier based on the item's 
rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Items table. The 
character also makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check 
and adds that check's total to the roll. The subsequent 
total determines what a buyer offers to pay for the item. 
CHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES 
You determine a buyer's identity. Buyers sometimes 
procure rare and very rare items through proxies to 
ensure that their identities remain unknown. If the 
buyer is shady, it's up to you whether the sale creates 
legal complications for the party later.

S OWING R UMORS 
waying public opinion can be an effective way to bring 
down a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors 
is an efficient, if underhanded, way to accomplish that 
goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject's 
-randing in a community or embroil someone in 
scandal. A rumor needs to be simple, concrete, and hard 
o disprove. An effective rumor also has to be believable, 
playing off what people want to believe about the person 
in question. 
Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization 
-equires a number of days depending on the size of the 
community, as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a 
own or city, the time spent must be continuous. If the 
character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on 
an adventure for another few days and then returns, 
rhe rumor fades away without the benefit of constant 
:-epetition.

Time Required

The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover 
- e cost of drinks, social appearances, and the like. 
_ r the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the 
-haracter must make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception 
r Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the 
community's prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts 
ne step toward friendly or hostile, as the character 
ishes. If the check fails, the rumor gains no traction, 
and further attempts to propagate it fail. 
Shifting a community's general attitude toward 
a person or organization doesn't affect everyone in 
- e community. Individuals might hold to their own 
pinions, particularly if they have personal experience 
'"' dealing with the subject of the rumors. 
-RAINING TO GAIN LEVELS 
- a variant rule, you can require characters to spend 
:.owntime training or studying before they gain the 
oefits of a new level. If you choose this option, once a 
aracter has earned enough experience points to attain 
"' new level, he or she must train for a number of days 
: fore gaining any class features associated with the 
- w level. 
The training time required depends on the level to be 
, ained, as shown on the Training to Gain Levels table. 
e training cost is for the total training time.

CREATING D OWNTIME AC T IVITIES 
Your players might be interested in pursuing downtime 
activities that aren't covered in this chapter or in 
the Player's Handbook. If you invent new downtime 
activities, remember the following: 
An activity should never negate the need or desire for 
characters to go on adventures. 
Activities that have a monetary cost associated with 
them provide opportunities for player characters to 
spend their hard-won treasure. 
Activities that reveal new adventure hooks and 
previously unknown facts about your campaign can 
help you foreshadow future events and conflicts. 
For an activity you expect a character to repeat 
with variable degrees of success, consider creating 
a random outcome table, modeled on the ones in 
this chapter. 
• If a character belongs to a class or has a proficiency or 
background that would make him or her well suited 
to a particular activity, consider granting a bonus to 
ability checks made by the character to complete that 
activity successfully.
