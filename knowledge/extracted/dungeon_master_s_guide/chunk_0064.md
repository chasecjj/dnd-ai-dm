?or example, an encounter with one bugbear and 
-:~ee hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, 
-:iling it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level 
-:aracters and one 2nd-level character (which has 
_ .::.ard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly 
- ounter threshold of 1,400 XP).

:; the party contains fewer than three characters, 
-;:;:>ly the next highest multiplier on the Encounter 
~:.Jt ip liers table. For example, apply a multiplier of 
_ 5 when the characters fight a single monster, and a 
-uJtiplier of 5 for groups of fifteen or more monsters. 
J the party contains six or more characters, use the 
-::xt lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 
_ 5 for a single monster .

_,, 
For such encounters, treat each discrete part or wave as 
a separate encounter for the purpose of determining its 
difficulty. 
A party can't benefit from a short rest between parts 
of a multipart encounter, so they won't be able to spend 
Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that 
require a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted 
XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is 
higher than one-third of the party's expected XP total 
for the adventuring day (see "The Adventuring Day," 
below), the encounter is going to be tougher than the 
sum of its parts. 
BUILDING ENCOUNTERS ON A BUDGET 
You can build an encounter if you know its desired 
difficulty. The party's XP thresholds give you an XP 
budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy!.

medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember 
that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than 
their base XP values would indicate (see step 4). 
For example, using the party from step 2, you can 
build a medium encounter by making sure that the 
adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP 
(the party's threshold for a medium encounter) and 
no more than 825 XP (the party's threshold for a hard 
encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such 
as a manticore or owl bear) is worth 700 XP, so that's 
one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each 
one will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of 
dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP 
value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the 
party as well. 
To assist with this approach, appendix B presents a 
list of all monsters in the Monster Manual organized by 
challenge rating. 
THE ADVENTURING DAY 
Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average 
luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six 
to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the 
adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers 
can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters, 
they can handle fewer. 
In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an 
encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and 
other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how 
far the party is likely to progress. 
For each character in the party, use the Adventuring 
Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is 
expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all 
party members to get a total for the party's adventuring 
day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP 
value for encounters the party can handle before the 
characters will need to take a long rest.

SHORT RESTS 
In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the 
party will likely need to take two short rests, about one-
third and two-thirds of the way through the day. 
MODIFYING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
An encounter can be made easier or harder based on 
the choice of location and the situation.
