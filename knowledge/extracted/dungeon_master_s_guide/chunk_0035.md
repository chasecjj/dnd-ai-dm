SPELLS 
Sa~ya raised her hands and began to declaim the words of 
a very powerful spell, one of the most dangerous she knew, 
a spell designed to breach the barriers between the planes 
and create a magical bridge into another realm of existence. 
The myth a/ thrummed in response, the intangible pulse of 
the old device taking on a new and different note. Sarya 
ignored the myth a/ stone's change and pressed on, finishing 
her gate spell with skill and confidence. 
"The gate is open!" she cried. "Malkizid, come forth !" 
Before Sarya a great ring or hoop of golden magic 
coalesced from the air. Through it she glimpsed the realm 
of Malkizid, an infernal wasteland of parched desert, 
windswept rifts, and black, angry skies torn by crimson 
lightning. Then , through the gate, the archdevil Malkizid 
appeared. With one smooth step he crossed from his 
infernal plane into the myth a/ chamber.

A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to 
other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can 
directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with 
different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows 
adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the astral 
projection spell lets adventurers project themselves 
into the Astral Plane and from there travel to the 
Outer Planes. 
Plane Shift. The plane shift spell has two important 
limitations. The first is the material component: a 
small, forked, metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to 
the desired planar destination. The spell requires the 
proper resonating frequency to home in on the correct 
location, and the fork must be made of the right material 
(sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell's magic 
properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp), 
but even the act of researching the correct specifications 
can lead to adventure. After all. not many people 
voluntarily travel into the depth of Carceri, so very few 
know what kind of tuning fork i required to get there. 
Second, the spell doesn't end the caster to a specific 
location unless he or she ha 
pecialized information. 
The sigil sequence of a teleponation circle located on 
another plane allows the ca rer ro travel directly to that

circle, but such knowledge is even harder to come 
by than the specifications of the required tuning 
fork. Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to 
a location in the general vicinity of the desired spot. 
Wherever the adventurers arrive, they'll most likely 
still need to undertake a journey to reach the object of a 
planar quest. 
Gate. The gate spell opens a portal linked to a specific 
point on another plane of existence. The spell provides 
a shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of 
the guardians and trials that would normally fill such 
a journey. But this 9th-level spell is out of reach for all 
but the most powerful characters, and it does nothing to 
negate any obstacles that wait at the destination. 
The gate spell is powerful, but not infallible. A deity, 
demon lord, or other powerful entity can prevent such a 
portal from opening within its dominion. 
ASTRAL PLANE 
Halisstra opened her eyes and found herself drifting in 
an endless silver sea. Soft gray clouds moved slowly in 
the distance, while strange dark streaks twisted violently 
through the sky, anchored in ends so distant she couldn't 
perceive them, their middle parts revolving angrily like 
pieces of string rolled between a child's fingertips. She 
glanced down, wondering what supported her, and saw 
nothing but more of the strange pearly sky beneath her feet 
and all around her. 
She drew in a sudden breath, surprised by the sight, and 
felt her lungs fill with something sweeter and perhaps a little 
more solid than air, but instead of gagging or drowning 
on the stuff she seemed perfectly acclimated to it. An 
electric thrill raced through her limbs as she found herself 
mesmerized by the simple act of respiration. 
-Richard Baker, Condemnatio 
The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, 
where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach 
the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery sea, the same 
above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray 
streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most 
of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors 
occasionally stumble upon the petrified corpse of a
