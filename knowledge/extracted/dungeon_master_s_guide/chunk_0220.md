Age. Aasimar mature at the arne rate as humans but 
live a few years longer. 
Alignment. Due to their celestial heritage, aasimar 
are often good. However, some aasimar fall into evil, 
rejecting their heritage. 
Size. Aasimar are built like well-proportioned 
humans. Your size is Medium. 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Darkvision. Thanks to your celestial heritage, you 
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You 
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You 
can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 
Celestial Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic 
damage and radiant damage. 
Celestial Legacy. You know the light can trip. Once 
you reach 3rd level, you can cast the lesser restoration 
spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do 
so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, 
you can cast the daylight spell once with this trait as a 
3rd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when 
you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting 
ability for these spells. 
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and Celestial. 
MODIFYING A CLASS 
The classes in the Player's Handbook capture a wide 
range of character archetypes, but your campaign world 
might have need of something more. The following 
section discusses ways to modify existing classes to 
better serve your game's needs. 
CHANGING PROFICIENCIES 
Changing a class's proficiencies is a safe and simple way 
to modify a class to better reflect your world. Swapping 
out one skill or tool proficiency for another doesn't make 
a character any stronger or weaker, but doing so can 
change the flavor of a class in subtle ways. 
For example, a prominent guild of rogues in your 
world might worship a patron deity, performing secret 
missions in that deity's name. To reflect this cultural 
detail, you could add Religion to the list of skills that a 
rogue character can choose as a proficiency. You could 
even mandate that skill as one of the choices for rogues 
who belong to this guild. 
You can also change armor and weapon proficiencies 
to reflect certain aspects of your world. For example, 
you could decide that the clerics of a particular deity 
belong to an order that forbids the accumulation of 
material goods, other than magic items useful for their 
divine mission. Such clerics carry a staff, but they 
are forbidden from wearing armor or using weapons 
other than that staff. To reflect this, you could remove 
the armor and weapon proficiencies for clerics of this 
faith, making them proficient with the quarterstaff and 
nothing else. You could give them a benefit to make up 
for the loss of proficiencies- something like the monk's 
Unarmored Defense class feature, but presented as a 
divine blessing. 
CHANGING SPELL LISTS 
Modifying a class's spell list usually has little effect on 
a character's power but can change the flavor of a class 
significantly. In your world, paladins might not swear 
their oaths to ideals, but instead swear fealty to powerful 
sorcerers. To capture this story concept, you could build 
a new paladin spell list with spells meant to protect 
their masters, drawn from the sorcerer or wizard lists. 
Suddenly, the paladin feels like a different class. 
Be cautious when changing the warlock spell list. 
Since warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest, 
they have the potential to use certain spells more times 
in a day than other classes do. 
RESTRICTING CLASS ACCESS 
Without changing the way a class functions, you can 
root it more firmly in the world by associating the class 
with a particular race or culture. 
For example, you might decide that bards, sorcerers, 
warlocks, and wizards represent the magical traditions 
of four different races or cultures. The bardic colleges 
might be closed to everyone except elves, dragonborn 
might be the only creatures capable of becoming 
sorcerers, and all warlocks in your world might be 
human. You could break that down still further: bards 
of the College of Lore could be high elves, and bards 
of the College of War could be wood elves. Gnomes 
discovered the school of illusion, so all wizards who 
specialize in that school are gnomes. Different human 
cultures produce warlocks with different pacts, and 
so on. Similarly, different cleric domains might reflect 
entirely separate religions associated with different 
races or cultures. 
You decide how flexible you want to be in allowing 
a player character to break these restrictions. Can a 
half-elf live among the elves and study their bardic 
traditions? Can a dwarf stumble into a warlock pact 
despite having no connection to a culture that normally 
produces warlocks? As always, it's better to say yes and 
use the player's desire as an opportunity to develop the 
character's story and that of your world, rather than 
shutting down possibilities. 
SUBSTITUTING CLASS FEATURES 
If one or more features of a given class don't exactly 
fit the theme or tone of your campaign, you can pull 
them out of the class and replace them with new 
ones. In doing so, you should strive to make sure 
that the new options are just as appealing as the 
ones you are removing, and that the substitute class 
features contribute to the class's effectiveness at social 
interaction, exploration, or combat just as well as those 
being replaced. 
Ultimately, a class exists to help a player express a 
particular character concept, and any class feature you 
replace is also removing an aspect of that character. 
Substituting a class feature should be done only to fit a 
specific need for your campaign, or to appeal to a player 
trying to create a specific kind of character (perhaps one 
modeled after a character from a novel, TV series, comic 
book, or movie).
