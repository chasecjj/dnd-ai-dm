pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after 
flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 
hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action. 
Fan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action 
to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token 
disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The 
fa n floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the 
sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per 
hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action. 
Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token 
to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token 
disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped 
like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled 
and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. 
You can use an action while on the boat to command it 
to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry 
up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large 
creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a 
Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 
hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as 
an action. 
Tree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You 
can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space 
on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place 
a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree 
is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its 
branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. 
Whip. You can use an action to throw the token to a 
point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a 
floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus 
action to make a melee spell attack against a creature 
within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. 
On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage. 
As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the 
whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a 
creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 
hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you 
are incapacitated or die. 
QUIVER OF EHLONNA 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to 
an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to 
hold numerous items while never weighing more than 
2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 
sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize 
compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar 
objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long 
objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears. 
You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing 
so from a regular quiver or scabbard. 
RING OF ANIMAL INFLUENCE 
Ring, rare 
This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can 
use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of 
the following spells: 
Animal friendship (save DC 13) 
Fear (save DC 13), targeting only beasts that have an 
Intelligence of 3 or lower
