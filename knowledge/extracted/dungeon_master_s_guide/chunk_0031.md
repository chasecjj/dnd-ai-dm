CROSSING THE STREAMS 
The renowned paladin Murlynd, from the world of 
Oerth (as featured in Greyhawk novels and game 
products), dresses in the traditional garb of Earth's 
Old West and wears a pair of six-shooters strapped 
to his waist. The Mace of St. Cuthbert, a holy weapon 
belonging to Greyhawk's god of justice, found its way 
to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1985. 
Somewhere in the Barrier Peaks of Oerth, the wreckage 
of a spacefaring vessel is said to lie, with bizarre alien 
lifeforms and strange items of technology on board. And 
the famous wizard Elminster of the Forgotten Realms 
has been said to make occasional appearances in the 
kitchen of Canadian writer Ed Greenwood- where he is 
sometimes joined by wizards from the worlds of Oerth 
an,d Krynn (homeworld of the Dragon lance saga). 
Deep in D&D's roots are elements of science 
fiction and science fantasy, and your campaign might 
draw on those sources as well. It's okay to send your 
characters hurtling through a magic mirror to Lewis 
Carroll's Wonderland, put them aboard a ship traveling 
between the stars, or set your campaign in a far-future 
world where laser blasters and magic missiles exist 
side by side. The possibilities are limitless. Chapter 
9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop," provides tools for 
exploring those possibilities.
