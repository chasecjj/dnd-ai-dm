must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed 
save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful good 
or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature's 
current alignment). The change becomes permanent 
if the creature doesn't leave the plane within ld4 days. 
Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts to normal 
after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia. 
Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature 
also restores its original alignment. 
ELYSIUM 
Elysium is home to creatures of unfettered kindness and 
compassion, and a welcome refuge for planar travelers 
seeking a safe haven. The plane's bucolic landscapes 
glimmer with life and beauty in their prime. Tranquility 
seeps into the bones and souls of those who enter the 
plane. It is the heaven of well-earned rest, a place where 
tears of joy glisten on many a cheek. 
OPTIONAL RuLE : OvERWHELMING joY 
Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming 
trapped by overwhelming sensations of contentment 
and happiness. At the end of each long rest taken on 
this plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to leave 
the plane before taking another long rest. After three 
failed saving throws, the creature never willingly leaves 
the plane and, if forcibly removed, does everything in its 
power to return to the plane. A dispel evil and good spell 
removes this effect from the creature. 
THE BEASTLANDS 
The Beastlands is a plane of nature unbound, of forests 
ranging from moss-hung mangroves to snow-laden 
pines, of thick jungles where the branches are woven so 
tight that no light penetrates, of vast plains where grains

and wildflowers wave in the wind with vibrant life. The 
plane embodies nature's wildness and beauty, but it also 
speaks to the animal within all living things. 
OPTIONAL RULE : HUNTER'S PARADISE 
Visitors to the Beastlands find their hunting and 
stalking capabilities improved, and characters have 
advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling), Wisdom 
(Perception), and Wisdom (Survival) checks while there. 
OPTIONAL RULE : BEAST TRANSFORMATION 
Whenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the 
slayer must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw 
or become transformed (as the polymorph spell) into the 
type of beast that was slain. In this form, the creature 
retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of 
each long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the 
saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature 
returns to its true form. After three failed saving throws. 
the transformation can be undone only by a remove 
curse spell or similar magic. 
ARBOREA 
Larger than life, Arborea is a place of violent moods 
and deep affections, of whim backed by steel, and of 
passions that blaze brightly until they burn out. Its 
good-natured inhabitants are dedicated to fighting evil, 
but their reckless emotions sometimes break free with 
devastating consequences. Rage is as common and as 
honored as joy in Arborea. There the mountains and 
forests are extravagantly massive and beautiful, and 
every glade and stream is inhabited by nature spirits 
that brook no infringement. Travelers must tread lightly. 
Arborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elve 
born on this plane have the celestial type and are wild at 
heart, ready to battle evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they 
look and behave like normal elves.
