Destroying the Book. The Book of Vile Darkness 
allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore 
contained on those pages finds its way back into the 
book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages 
to the tome. 
If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed 
for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark 
corner of the multiverse. 
A creature attuned to the book for one hundred 
years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text 
that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, 
destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding 
flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the 
multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later. 
If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns 
to dust and is forever destroyed. 
EYE AND HAND OF VECNA 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed 
voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all 
wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a 
terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape 
his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps 
to prevent his end from ever coming about. 
Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a 
ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond 
death, he became the greatest of allliches. Even 
though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna 
continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable 
and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to 
speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master 
of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of 
the Rotted Tower. 
Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the 
Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord 
made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the 
reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end 
in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. 
Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, 
grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered 
One's will in the world. 
The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might 
be found together or separately. The eye looks like a 
bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a 
mummified and shriveled left extremity. 
To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye 
and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye 
grafts itself to your head and remains there until you 
die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye 
with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is 
ever removed, you die. 
To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left 
hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against 
the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and 
becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever 
removed, you die.

ofVecna each have the following random properties:
