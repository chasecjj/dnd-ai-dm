RANDOM TRAPS 
If you need a trap quickly or want to drop random 
traps into a dungeon, use the sample traps presented 
in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments" or the tables 
below. If you use the tables, start with the Trap Effects 
and Trap Trigger tables to decide the type of trap, 
then use the Trap Damage Severity tables to decide 
how deadly it should be. For more information on trap 
damage severity, see chapter 5.

RANDOM TRICKS 
Tricks are quirkier and less deadly than traps. Some 
are effects left behind by the dungeon's creators, while 
others might be manifestations of the strange magical 
energy suffusing the dungeon. 
The following tables allow you to generate random 
tricks. Roll first to determine an object that the trick 
is placed on, then roll to determine the nature of the 
trick. Some tricks are permanent effects that can't be 
dispelled; others are temporary or can be neutralized 
with a dispel magic spell. You decide which is which.
