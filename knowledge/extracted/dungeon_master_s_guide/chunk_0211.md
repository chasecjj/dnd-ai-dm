adjust the challenge rating uggesred by its damage 
output up or down by 1 for e\·ery 2 points of difference. 
If the monster relies more on effects with saving 
throws than on attacks, use the monster's save DC 
instead of its attack bonus. 
If your monster uses different attack bonuses or save 
DCs, use the ones that will come up the most often. 
Average Challenge Rating. The monster's final 
challenge rating is the average of its defensive and 
offensive challenge ratings. Round the average up or 
down to the nearest challenge rating to determine 
your monster's final challenge rating. For example, if 
the creature's defensive challenge rating is 2 and its 
offensive rating is 3, its final rating is 3. 
With the final challenge rating, you can determine the 
monster's proficiency bonus using the Monster Statistics 
by Challenge Rating table. Use the Experience Points 
by Challenge Rating table to determine how much XP 
the monster is worth. A monster of challenge rating 
0 is worth 0 XP if it poses no threat. Otherwise, it is 
worth 10 XP. 
Creating a monster isn't just a number-crunching 
exercise. The guidelines in this chapter can help you 
create monsters, but the only way to know whether a 
monster is fun is to playtest it. After seeing your monster 
in action, you might want to adjust the challenge rating 
up or down based on your experiences.

CREATING A MONSTER STAT BLOCK 
If you want a full monster stat block, use the following 
method to create your new monster. 
The introduction to the Monster Manual explains all 
the components of a monster's stat block. Familiarize 
yourself with that material before you begin. In the 
course of creating your monster, if you find yourself 
unable to make a decision, let the examples in the 
Monster Manual guide you. 
Once you have a monster concept in mind, follow the 
steps below. 
STEP 1. N A ME 
A monster's name should be given as much 
consideration as any other aspect of the monster, 
if not more. 
Your monster might be based on a real-world creature 
or a monster from myth, in which case its name might 
be obvious. If you need to invent a name, keep in 
mind that the best names either reflect the monster's 
appearance or nature (such as the mimic and the 
owlbear) or have a nice ring to them (such as the chuul 
and the thri-kreen). 
STEP 2. SIZE 
Mak6 your monster whatever size you want: Tiny, Small, 
Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. 
A monster's size determines which die is used to 
calculate its hit points in step 8. Size also determines 
how much space the monster occupies, as discussed in 
the Player's Handbook. 
STEP 3. T YPE 
A monster's type provides insight into its origins and 
nature. The Monster Manual describes each monster 
type. Choose the type that best fits your concept for 
the monster. 
STEP 4. ALIGNMENT 
If your monster has no concept of morals, it is 
unaligned. Otherwise, it has an alignment appropriate 
to its nature and moral outlook, as discussed in the 
Player's Handbook. 
STEP 5. ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS 
Monsters, like player characters, have the six ability 
scores. A monster can't have a score lower than 1 or 
higher than 30 in any ability. 
A monster's score in any ability determines its ability 
modifier, as shown in the Ability Scores and Modifiers 
table in the Player's Handbook. 
If you can't decide what a monster's ability scores 
should be, look for comparable monsters in the Monster 
Manual and mimic their ability scores. For example, 
if your monster is roughly as smart as a human 
commoner, give it an Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier). 
If it's as strong as an ogre, give it a Strength of 19 (+4 
modifier). 
STEP 6. EXPECTED CHALLENGE R ATING 
Choose a challenge rating for your monster. See step 
1 under "Creating Quick Monster Stats" for more 
information. You will use the proficiency bonus in later 
steps, so jot it down now or remember it. 
STEP 7. ARMOR CLASS 
A monster's Armor Class has a direct bearing on its 
challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine your 
monster's Armor Class in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can choose an appropriate AC 
based on the monster's expected challenge rating, as 
shown in the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating 
table. The table provides the baseline AC for a monster 
of a specific challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the 
AC as you see fit. For example, the baseline AC for a
