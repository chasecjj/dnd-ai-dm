often have considerable hereditary wealth). In exchange, 
they promise to protect their citizens from threats 
such as ore marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving 
human bandits. 
Nobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to 
supervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges 
in disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs, 
or bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they 
govern, chosen for their positions because they already 
hold the respect of their fellow citizens. 
Within towns and cities, lords share authority and 
administrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually 
their own relatives), and also with representatives of 
the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord 
mayor of noble birth is appointed to head the town or 
city council and to perform the same administrative 
functions that reeves carry out in villages. The council 
consists of representatives elected by the middle class. 
Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils, 
since the economic power of the middle class is often 
more important to the prosperity of a town or city than 
the hereditary authority of the nobility. 
The larger a settlement, the more likely that other 
individuals or organizations hold significant power 
there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual-a 
wise elder or a well-liked farmer-can wield more 
influence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve 
avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns 
and cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a 
prominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or 
an individual with magical power. 
FORMS OF GOVERNMENT 
A settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city 
might be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city 
governed by a merchant council. More likely, it's part of 
a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote 
realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your 
settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or 
region-who rules its ruler, and what other settlements 
might also lie under its control.

Typical and fantastical forms of government are 
described below. Choose one or randomly determine a 
form of government for a nation or city from the Forms 
of Government table. 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
Autocracy. One hereditary ruler wields absolute 
power. The autocrat either is supported by a well-
developed bureaucracy or military or stands as the 
only authority in an otherwise anarchic society. The 
dynastic ruler could be immortal or undead. Aundair 
and Karrnath, two kingdoms in the Eberron campaign 
setting, have autocrats with royal blood in their veins. 
Whereas Queen Aurala of Aundair relies on wizar.ds 
and spies to enforce her will, Kaius, the vampire king of 
Karrnath, has a formidable army of living and undead 
soldiers under his command. 
Bureaucracy. Various departments compose the 
government, each responsible for an aspect of rule. The 
department heads, ministers, or secretaries answer to a 
figurehead autocrat or council. 
Confederacy. Each individual city or town within 
the confederacy governs itself, but all contribute to a 
league or federation that promotes (at least in theory) 
the common good of all member states. Conditions and 
attitudes toward the central government vary from place 
to place within the confederacy. The Lords' Alliance in 
the Forgotten Realms setting is a loose confederacy of 
cities, while the Mror Holds in the Eberron campaign 
setting is a confederacy of allied dwarf clans. 
Democracy. Citizens or their elected representatives 
determine the laws in a democracy. A bureaucracy or 
military carries out the day-to-day work of government, 
with positions filled through open elections. 
Dictatorship. One supreme ruler holds absolute 
authority, but his or her rule isn't necessarily dynastic. 
In other respects this resembles an autocracy. In the 
Greyhawk campaign setting, a half-demon named Iuz is 
the dictator of a conquered land that bears his name. 
Feudalism. The typical government of Europe in 
the Middle Ages, a feudalistic society consists of layers 
of lords and vassals. The vassals provide soldiers or 
scutage (payment in lieu of military service) to the lords, 
who in turn promise protection to their vassals. 
Gerontocracy. Elders preside over this society. In 
some cases, long-lived races such as elves or dragons 
are entrusted with the leadership of the land. 
Hierarchy. A feudal or bureaucratic government 
where every member, except one, is subordinate to 
another member. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, 
the dragonarmies of Krynn form a military hierarchy, 
with the Dragon Highlords as leaders under the dragon 
queen Takhisis. 
Kleptocracy. This government is composed of groups 
or individuals primarily seeking wealth for themselves, 
often at the expense of their subjects. The grasping 
Bandit Kingdoms in the Grey hawk campaign setting 
are prime examples. A kingdom run by thieves' guilds 
would also fall into this category. 
Magocracy. The governing body is composed of 
spellcasters who rule directly as oligarchs or feudal 
lords, or participate in a democracy or bureaucracy. 
Examples include the Red Wizards of Thay in the 
Forgotten Realms campaign setting and the sorcerer-
kings of Athas in the Dark Sun campaign setting. 
Matriarchy or Patriarchy. This society is governed 
by the eldest or most important members of one gender. 
Draw cities are examples of theocratic matriarchies, for
