Blessings of Moradin. If you are a dwarf attuned to 
the axe, you gain the following benefits: 
You have immunity to poison damage. 
The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet. 
• You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to 
blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry. 
Conjure Earth Elemental. If you are holding the axe, 
you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental 
spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't 
use this property again until the next dawn. 
Travel the Depths. You can use an action to touch the 
axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the 
teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination 
is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or 
arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this 
property again until 3 days have passed. 
Curse. The axe bears a curse that affects any non-
dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement 
ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the 
creature's physical appearance and stature become 
more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like 
a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial 
traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical 
changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical 
in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can 
be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a 
greater restoration or remove curse spell. 
Destroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the 
axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where 
it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 
fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and 
is consumed. 
BOOK OF EXALTED DEEDS 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a 
creature of good alignment) 
The definitive treatise on all that is good in the 
multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures 
prominently in many religions. Rather than being a 
scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various 
authors filled the pages with their own vision of true 
virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil. 
The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. 
As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other 
corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can 
bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts 
have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail 
to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it 
offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose. 
A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, . 
keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of 
good alignment that is attuned to the book can release 
the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, 
the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and 
studying the book to digest its contents and gain its 
benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open 
pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning 
and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read 
from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage 
ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced 
or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash 
is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. 
Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last 
only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to 
perform at least one act of kindness or generosity wit 
the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil 
act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book. 
Random Properties. The Book of Exalted Deeds h~ 
the following random properties: 
2 minor beneficial properties 
• 2 major beneficial properties 
Increased Wisdom. After you spend the requisite 
amount of time reading and studying the book, your 
Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Y -
can't gain this benefit from the book more than once. 
Enlightened Magic. Once you've read and studied 
the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or 
paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher. 
Halo. Once you've read and studied the book, you 
gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light 
in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additionallO 
feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus 
action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on 
Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with 
good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks 
made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends 
and undead within the halo's bright light make attack 
rolls against you with disadvantage. 
Destroying the Book. It is rumored that the Book 0: 
Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exi .. 
in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the 
River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its 
pages and renders the book powerless for ld100 years 
BOOK OF VILE DARKNESS 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable 
wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's 
thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it 
contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the 
scrawled pages invites madness. 
Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book 
Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseas 
idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of 
blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna 
covered every vile topic he could, making the book a 
gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs. 
Other practitioners of evil have held the book and 
added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. 
Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works 
stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or. ·-
some cases, made notations and additions to existing 
text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. 
or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches 
that the original text can't be divined. 
Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary 
plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to 
approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever 
it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if th~ 
book rests on it long enough.
