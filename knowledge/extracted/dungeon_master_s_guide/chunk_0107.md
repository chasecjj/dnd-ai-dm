Beacon. The bearer can use a bonus action to 
cause the item to shed bright light in a 10-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional10 feet, or to 
extinguish the light. 
Compass. The wielder can use an action to learn 
which way is north. 
Conscientious. When the bearer of this item 
contemplates or undertakes a malevolent act, the 
item enhances pangs of conscience. 
Delver. While underground , the bearer of this item 
always knows the item's depth below the surface 
and the direction to the nearest staircase, ramp, or 
other path leading upward. 
Gleaming. This item never gets dirty. 
Guardian. The item whispers warnings to its 
bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the 
bearer isn't incapacitated. 
Harmonious. Attuning to this item takes only 1 
minute. 
Hidden Message. A message is hidden somewhere 
on the item. It might be visible only at a certain 
time of the year, under the light of one phase of the 
moon, or in a specific location. 
Key. The item is used to unlock a container, 
chamber, vault, or other entryway. 
Language. The bearer can speak and understand a 
language of the OM's choice while the item is on 
the bearer's person. 
Sentinel. Choose a kind of creature that is an 
enemy of the item's creator. This item glows faintly 
when such creatures are within 120 feet of it.

Quirk 
Blissful. While in possession of the item, the 
bearer feels fortunate and optimistic about what 
the future holds. Butterflies and other harmless 
creatures might frolic in the item's presence. 
Confident. The item helps its bearer feel self-
assured. 
Covetous. The item's bearer becomes obsessed 
with material wealth. 
Frail. The item crumbles, frays , chips, or cracks 
slightly when wielded, worn, or activated. This 
quirk has no effect on its properties, but if the item 
has seen much use, it looks decrepit. 
Hungry. This item's magical properties function 
only if fresh blood from a humanoid has been 
applied to it within the past 24 hours. It needs only 
a drop to activate. 
Loud. The item makes a loud noise-such as a 
clang, a shout, or a resonating gong-when used.

Minor Property 
Song Craft. Whenever this item is struck or is used 
to strike a foe, its bearer hears a fragment of an . 
ancient song. 
Strange Material. The item was created from 
a material that is bizarre given its purpose. Its 
durability is unaffected. 
Temperate. The bearer suffers no harm in 
temperatures as cold as -20 degrees Fahrenheit or 
as warm as 120 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Unbreakable. The item can't be broken. Special 
means must be used to destroy it. 
War Leader. The bearer can use an action to cause 
his or her voice to carry clearly for up to 300 feet 
until the end of the bearer's next turn. 
Waterborne. This item floats on water and other 
liquids. Its bearer has advantage on Strength 
(Athletics) checks to swim. 
Wicked. When the bearer is presented with an 
opportunity to act in a selfish or malevolent way, 
the item heightens the bearer's urge to do so. 
Illusion. The item is imbued with illusion magic, 
allowing its bearer to alter the item's appearance in 
minor ways. Such alterations don't change how the 
item is worn , carried, or wielded, and they have no 
effect on its other magical properties. For example, 
the wearer could make a red robe appear blue, or 
make a gold ring look like it's made of ivory. The 
item reverts to its true appearance when no one is 
carrying or wearing it. 
Roll twice, rerolling any additional 20s. 
Quirk 
Metamorphic. The item periodically and randomly 
alters its appearance in slight ways. The bearer has 
no control over these minor alterations, which have 
no effect on the item's use. 
Muttering. The item grumbles and mutters. A 
creature who listens carefully to the item might 
learn something useful. 
Painful. The bearer experiences a harmless flash of 
pain when using the item. 
Possessive. The item demands attunement when 
first wielded or worn, and it doesn't allow its 
bearer to attune to other items. (Other items 
already attuned to the bearer remain so until their 
attunement ends.) 
Repulsive. The bearer feels a sense of distaste 
when in contact with the item, and continues to 
sense discomfort while bearing it. 
Slothful. The bearer of this item feels slothful and 
lethargic. While attuned to the item, the bearer 
requires 10 hours to finish a long rest.
