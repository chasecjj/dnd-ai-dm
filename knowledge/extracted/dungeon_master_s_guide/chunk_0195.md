OPTIONAL RULE: DIAGONALS 
The Player's Handbook presents a simple method for 
counting movement and measuring range on a grid: 
count every square as 5 feet, even if you're moving 
diagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws 
of geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This 
optional rule provides more realism, but it requires 
more effort during combat. 
When measuring range or moving diagonally on a 
grid, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the 
second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern 
of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you're 
counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or 
vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. 
For example, a character might move one square 
diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight (15 feet), 
and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total 
movement of 30 feet. 
OPTIONAL RuLE : FACING 
If you want the precision of knowing which way a 
creature is facing, consider using this optional rule. 
Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its 
facing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it 
faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature 
can also change its facing as a reaction when any other 
creature moves. 
A creature can normally target only creatures in its 
front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This 
means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes 
attack rolls against it with advantage. 
Shields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks 
from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For 
example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it 
only against attacks from the front and left arcs. 
Feel free to determine that not all creatures have 
every type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre 
jelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a 
hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. 
On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space 
as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line 
outward from each corner of this side to determine the 
squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space 
determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining 
spaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs. 
On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs 
requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's 
space and create a wedge shape expanding out from 
there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side 
of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to 
either side of the creature are its side arcs. 
A square or hex might be in more than one arc, 
depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's 
space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one 
arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, 
use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that 
arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in 
the side arc. 
CHAPTER 8 \ RUNNING THE GAME 
ADJUDICATING REACTION TIMING 
Typical combatants rely on the opportunity attack 
and the Ready action for most of their reactions in a 
fight. Various spells and features give a creature more 
reaction options, and sometimes the timing of a reacti -
can be difficult to adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb: 
follow whatever timing is specified in the reaction's 
description. For example, the opportunity attack and 
the shield spell are clear about the fact that they can 
interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing 
specified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs 
after its trigger finishes, as in the Ready action. 
CHASES 
Strict application of the movement rules can turn a 
potentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair. 
Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while 
creatures with the same speed never close the distance 
between each other. This set of rules can make chase 
more exciting by introducing random elements. 
BEGINNING A CHASE 
A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any 
participants not already in initiative order must roll 
initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase 
can take one action and move on its turn. The chase 
ends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes. 
When a chase begins, determine the starting 
distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track 
the distance between them, and designate the pursuer 
closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer migh· 
change from round to round. 
RUNNING THE CHASE 
Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to use 
the Dash action every round. Pursuers who stop to casr 
spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their 
quarry, and a quarry that does so is likely to be caught. 
DASHING 
During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash 
action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution 
modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during 
the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 
Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one !eve. 
of exhaustion. 
A participant drops out of the chase if its exhaustion 
reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature 
can remove the levels of exhaustion it gained during the 
chase by finishing a short or long rest. 
SPELLS AND ATTACKS 
A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells 
against other creatures within range. Apply the 
normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks 
and spells. 
Chase participants can't normally make opportunity 
attacks against each other, since they are all assumed 
to be moving in the same direction at the same time.
