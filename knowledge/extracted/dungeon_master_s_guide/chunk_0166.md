ARTIFACTS 
An artifact is a unique magic item of tremendous power, 
with its own origin and history. An artifact might have 
been created by gods or mortals of awesome power. 
It could have been created in the midst of a crisis that 
threatened a kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse, 
and carry the weight of that pivotal moment in history. 
Some artifacts appear when they are needed most. 
For others, the reverse is true; when discovered, the 
world trembles at the ramifications of the find. In either 
case, introducing an artifact into a campaign requires 
forethought. The artifact could be an item that opposing 
sides are hoping to claim, or it might be something the 
adventurers need to overcome their greatest challenge. 
Characters don't typically find artifacts in the 
normal course of adventuring. In fact, artifacts only 
appear when you want them to, for they are as much 
plot devices as magic items. Tracking down and 
recovering an artifact is often the main goal of an 
adventure. Characters must chase down rumors,

exceptionally powerful. An artifact might have other 
properties that are either beneficial or detrimental. 
You can choose such properties from the tables in 
this section or determine them randomly. You can 
also invent new beneficial and detrimental properties. 
These properties typically change each time an artifact
