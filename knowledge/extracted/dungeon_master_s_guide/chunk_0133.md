IRON FLASK 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an 
action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a 
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the 
target is native to a plane of existence other than the one 
you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom 
saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has 
been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the 
saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the 
flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature 
at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to 
breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age. 
You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper 
and release the creature the flask contains. The creature 
is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and 
obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no 
commands or give it a command that is likely to result 
in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no 
actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in 
accordance with its normal disposition and alignment. 
An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside 
the flask, but the only way to determine the type of 
creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle 
might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or 
determined randomly.

This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and 
speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of 
lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out 
from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in 
the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on 
a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful 
one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when 
it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack 
against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage 
from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage. 
The javelin's property can't be used again until the 
next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used 
as a magic weapon.

KEOGHTOM'S OINTMENT 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 
doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The 
jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound. 
As an action, one dose of the ointment can be 
swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that 
receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be 
poisoned, and is cured of any disease. 
LANTERN OF REVEALING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint 
of o'il, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim 
light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and 
objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's 
bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, 
reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius. 
LUCK BLADE 
Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement) 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your 
person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. 
Luck. If the sword is on your person, you can call 
on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, 
ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use 
the second roll. This property can't be used again until 
the next dawn. 
Wish. The sword has 1d4- 1 charges. While holding 
it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast 
the wish spell from it. This property can't be used again 
until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it 
has no charges. 
MACE OF DISRUPTION 
Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) 
When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic 
weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant 
damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after 
taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom 
saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the 
creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your 
next turn. 
While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 
20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. 
MACE OF SMITING 
Weapon (mace), rare 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 
when you use the mace to attack a construct. 
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with 
this weapon, the target takes an extra 7 bludgeoning 
damage, or an extra 14 bludgeoning damage if it's a 
construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after 
taking this damage, it is destroyed.
