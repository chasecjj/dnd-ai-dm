This approach also allows you to break your design 
work down into smaller pieces. Create material such 
as adventures, NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at 
a time. You only need to worry about the details of the 
next tier as the characters approach it. Even better, as 
the campaign takes unexpected turns in response to the 
players' choices, you don't have to worry about redoing 
much work. 
LEVELS 1- 4: LOCAL HEROES 
Characters in this tier are still learning the range of 
class features that define them, including their choice 
of specialization. But even 1st-level characters are 
heroes, set apart from the common people by natural 
characteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater 
destiny that lies before them. 
At the start of their careers, characters use 1st-
and 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The 
magic items they find include common consumable 
items (potions and scrolls) and a very few uncommon 
permanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in 
a single encounter, but it doesn't change the course of an 
adventure. 
The fate of a village might hang on the success or 
failure of low-level adventurers, who trust their lives 
to their fledgling abilities. These characters navigate 
dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where 
they can expect to fight savage orcs, ferocious wolves, 
giant spiders, evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and 
hired thugs. If they face even a young dragon, they're 
better off avoiding a fight. 
LEVELS 5-10: HEROES OF THE REALM 
By the time they reach this tier, adventurers have 
mastered the basics of their class features, though they 
continue to improve throughout these levels. They have 
found their place in the world and have begun to involve 
themselves in the dangers that surround them. 
Dedicated spellcasters learn 3rd-level spells at the 
start of this tier. Suddenly characters can fly, damage 
large numbers of foes with fireball and lightning bolt 
pells, and even breathe underwater. They master 
5th-level spells by the end of the tier, and spells such 
as teleportation circle, scrying, flame strike, legend 
lore, and raise dead can have a significant impact on 
their adventures. They start acquiring more permanent 
magic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which 
will serve them for the rest of their careers. 
The fate of a region might depend on the adventures 
that characters of levels 5 to 10 undertake. These 
adventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient 
ruins, where they confront savage giants, ferocious 
hydras, fearless golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils, 
bloodthirsty demons, crafty mind flayers, and drow 
assassins. They might have a chance of defeating a 
young dragon that has established a lair but not yet 
extended its reach far into the surrounding territory. 
LEVELS 11-16: MASTERS OF THE 
REALM 
By 11th level, characters are shining examples of 
courage and determination-true paragons in the world, 
set well apart from the masses. At this tier, adventurers 
are far more versatile than they were at lower levels, and 
they can usually find the right tool for a given challenge. 
Dedicated spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells 
at 11th level, including spells that completely change 
the way adventurers interact with the world. Their big, 
flashy spells are significant in combat- disintegrate, 
blade barrier, and heal, for example- but behind-the-
scenes spells such as word of recall, find the path, 
contingency, teleport, and true seeing alter the way 
players approach their adventures. Each spell level after 
that point introduces new effects with an equally large 
impact. The adventurers find rare magic items (and very 
rare ones) that bestow similarly powerful abilities. 
The fate of a nation or even the world depends on 
momentous quests that such characters undertake. 
Adventurers explore uncharted regions and delve into 
long-forgotten dungeons, where they confront terrible 
masterminds of the lower planes, cunning rakshasas 
and beholders, and hungry purple worms. They might 
encounter and even defeat a powerful adult dragon 
that has established a lair and a significant presence in 
the world. 
At this tier, adventurers make their mark on the 
world in a variety of ways, from the consequences of 
their adventures to the manner in which they spend 
their hard-won treasure and exploit their well-deserved 
reputations. Characters of this level construct fortresses 
on land deeded them by local rulers. They found guilds, 
temples, or martial orders. They take on apprentices 
or students of their own. They broker peace between 
nations or lead them into war. And their formidable 
reputations attract the attention of very powerful foes. 
LEVELS 17-20: MASTERS OF THE 
WORLD 
By 17th level, characters have superheroic capabilities, 
and their deeds and adventures are the stuff of legend. 
Ordinary people can hardly dream of such heights of 
power-or such terrible dangers. 
Dedicated spellcasters at this tier wield earthshaking 
9th-level spells such as wish, gate, storm of vengeance, 
and astral projection. Characters have several rare 
and very rare magic items at their disposal, and begin 
discovering legendary items such as a vorpal sword or a 
staff of the magi. 
Adventures at these levels have far-reaching 
consequences, possibly determining the fate of 
millions in the Material Plane and even places beyond. 
Characters traverse otherworldly realms and explore 
demiplanes and other extraplanar locales, where they 
fight savage bator demons, titans, archdevils, lich 
archmages, and even avatars of the gods themselves. 
The dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous 
power, whose sleep troubles kingdoms and whose 
waking threatens existence itself.
