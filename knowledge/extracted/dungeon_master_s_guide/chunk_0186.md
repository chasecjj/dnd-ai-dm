RESOLUTION AND CONSEQUENCES 
You determine the consequences of attack rolls, ability 
checks, and saving throws. In most cases, doing so is 
straightforward. When an attack hits, it deals damage. 
When a creature fails a saving throw, the creature 
suffers a harmful effect. When an ability check equals or 
exceeds the DC, the check succeeds. 
As a DM, you have a variety of flourishes and 
approaches you can take when adjudicating success and 
failure to make things a little less black-and-white. 
SuccEss AT A CosT 
Failure can be tough, but the agony is compounded 
when a character fails by the barest margin. When a 
character fails a roll by only 1 or 2, you can allow the 
character to succeed at the cost of a complication or 
hindrance. Such complications can run along any of the 
following lines: 
A character manages to get her sword past a 
hobgoblin's defenses and turn a near miss into a hit, 
but the hobgoblin twists its shield and disarms her. 
A character narrowly escapes the full brunt of a 
fireball but ends up prone. 
A character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but 
the kobold reveals its secrets anyway while shrieking 
at the top of its lungs, alerting other nearby monsters. 
• A character manages to finish an arduous climb to the 
top of a cliff despite slipping, only to realize that the 
rope on which his companions dangle below him is 
close to breaking. 
When you introduce costs such as these, try to make 
them obstacles and setbacks that change the nature 
of the adventuring situation. In exchange for success, 
players must consider new ways of facing the challenge. 
You can also use this technique when a character 
succeeds on a roll by hitting the DC exactly, 
complicating marginal success in interesting ways. 
DEGREES OF FAILURE 
Sometimes a failed ability check has different 
consequences depending on the degree of failure. For 
example, a character who fails to disarm a trapped chest 
might accidentally spring the trap if the check fails by 
5 or more, whereas a lesser failure means that the trap 
wasn't triggered during the botched disarm attempt. 
Consider adding similar distinctions to other checks. 
Perhaps a failed Charisma (Persuasion) check means a 
queen won't help, whereas a failure of 5 or more means 
she throws you ir the dungeon for your impudence. 
CRITICAL SUCCESS OR FAILURE 
Rolling a 20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw 
doesn't normally have any special effect. However, 
you can choose to take such an exceptional roll into 
account when adjudicating the outcome. It's up to you 
to determine how this manifests in the game. An easy 
approach is to increase the impact of the success or 
failure. For example, rolling a 1 on a failed attempt 
to pick a lock might break the thieves' tools being 
used, and rolling a 20 on a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check might reveal an extra clue. 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 
• 
EXPLORATION 
This section provides guidance for running exploration, 
especially travel, tracking, and visibility. 
USING A MAP 
Whatever environment the adventurers are exploring, 
you can use a map to follow their progress as you relate 
the details of their travels. In a dungeon, tracking 
movement on a map lets you describe the branching 
passages, doors, chambers, and other features the 
adventurers encounter as they go, and gives the players 
the opportunity to choose their own path. Similarly, a 
wilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and 
other features that might guide the characters on their 
travels- or lead them astray. 
The Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on 
maps of different scales. The table shows how much 
distance on a map the adventurers can cover on foot 
in minutes, hours, or days. The table uses the travel 
paces- slow, normal, and fast-described in the Player's 
Handbook. Characters moving at a normal pace can 
walk about 24 miles in a day.

SPECIAL TRAVEL PACE 
The rules ori travel pace in the Player's Handbook 
assume that a group of travelers adopts a pace that, over 
time, is unaffected by the individual members' walking 
speeds. The difference between walking speeds can 
be significant during combat, but during an overland 
journey, the difference vanishes as travelers pause to 
catch their breath, the faster ones wait for the slower 
ones, and one traveler's quickness is matched by 
another traveler's endurance. 
A character bestride a phantom steed, soaring 
through the air on a carpet of flying, or riding a sailboar 
or a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn't travel 
at a normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind 
doesn't tire the way a creature does and the air doesn't 
contain the types of obstructions found on land. When a 
creature is traveling with a flying speed or with a speed 
granted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as 
wind or a water current), translate that speed into travel 
rates using the following rules: 
In 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to 
your speed times 10. 
In 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to 
your speed divided by 10.
