TENTACLE Ron 
Rod, rare (requires attunement) 
Made by the drow, this rod is a magic weapon that end_ 
in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you 
can use an action to direct each tentacle to attack a 
creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Each tentac ~ 
makes a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. On a hit, 
the tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit 
a target with all three tentacles, it must make a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature's 
speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity 
saving throws, and it can't use reactions for 1 minute. 
Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an 
action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of ea -
of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the 
effect on itself on a success.

TOME OF THE STILLED TONGUE 
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a 
wizard) 
This thick leather-bound volume has a desiccated 
tongue pinned to the front cover. Five of these tomes 
exist, and it's unknown which one is the original. The 
grisly cover decoration on the first tome of the stilled 
tongue once belonged to a treacherous former servant 
of the lich-god Vecna, keeper of secrets. The tongues 
pinned to the covers of the four copies came from othe:-
spellcasters who crossed Vecna. The first few pages o' 
each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The 
remaining pages are blank and pristine. 
If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a 
spellbook and an arcane focus. In addition, while 
holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a 
spell you have written in this tome, without expend in 
a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic component 
Once used, this property of the tome can't be used agai::. 
until the next dawn. 
While attuned to the book, you can remove the tonguF 
from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in 
the book are permanently erased.
