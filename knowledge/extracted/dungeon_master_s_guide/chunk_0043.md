PLANE OF FIRE 
Fire represents vibrancy, passion, and change. At 
its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the 
efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of 
inspiration, the warmth of compassion, and the flame 
of desire. 
A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky 
above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a 
1-l-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep 
::-ed at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane 
display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly 
lin ding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below) 
takes place during the darker hours. 
The weather on the plane is marked by fierce winds 
and thick ash. Although the air is breathable, creatures 
ot native to the plane must cover their mouths and 
eyes to avoid stinging cinders. The efreet use magic to 
·eep the cinder storms away from the City of Brass, 
- ut elsewhere in the plane, the wind is always at least 
· lustery and rises to hurricane force during the 
orst storms. 
The heat in the Plane of Fire is comparable to 
a hot desert on the Material Plane, and poses a 
::imilar threat to travelers (see "Extreme Heat" in 
hapter 5, "Adventure Environments"). The deeper 
one goes into the plane, the rarer water becomes. 
3eyond a point, the plane holds no sources of water, 
-
travelers must carry their own supplies or produce 
ater by magic. 
The Plane of Fire is dominated by the vast Cinder 
astes, a great expanse of black cinders and embers 
ossed by rivers of lava. Roving bands of salamanders 
bartle each other, raid azer outposts, and avoid the 
~ reet. Ancient ruins dot the desert- remnants of 
:"orgotten civilizations. 
A great range of volcanic mountains called the 
Fountains of Creation is home to azers. These rocky 
;>eaks curl from the edge of the Plane of Earth around 
- e Cinder Wastes toward the fiery heart of the plane. 
the edge of the plane, the mountains are also called 
e Plane of Magma. Fire giants and red dragons 
:nake their homes here, as well as creatures from the 
eighboring planes. 
Lava flows through the volcanoes toward the Plane 
f Air and pools into a great lava sea, called the Sea 
of Fire, sailed by efreet and azers in great brass ships. 
-lands of obsidian and basalt jut up from the sea, 
otted with ancient ruins and the lairs of powerful 
::-ed dragons. On the shore of the Sea of Fire stands 
the City of Brass. 
THE CITY OF BRASS 
Perhaps the best-known location in the Inner Planes is 
the City of Brass, on the shores of the Sea of Fire. This 
i the fabled city of the efreet, and its ornate spires and 
metal walls reflect their grandiose and cruel nature. 
True to the nature of the Plane of Fire, everything in , 
the city seems alive with dancing flames, reflecting the 
.;brant energy of the place. 
Adventurers frequently come here on quests for 
.egendary magic. If it's possible to buy magic items at 
all. the City of Brass is the most likely place to find any
