give you a good sense of the organization's personality. 
From there, think about typical members. How might 
people describe them? What are the typical members' 
classes and alignments? What personality traits do they 
tend to share? 
Choosing a symbol and a motto for the organization 
is a way of summing up the work you've done so far. 
A faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a 
very different personality from one that uses a winged 
viper. For a motto, choose not just a message but also 
a tone and style of speech that fits the organization as 
you've defined it. Consider the motto of the Harpers: 
"Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all." The 
Harpers have a straightforward message of freedom 
and prosperity. Contrast that with the motto of a 
group of politically allied cities in the North calling 
themselves the Lords' Alliance: "Threats to home must 
be terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our 
security." These are sophisticated people involved in 
a delicate political alliance, with more emphasis on 
stability than on fairness and equality. 
Finally, think about the ways that player characters 
might come into contact with the organization. Who 
are the important members-not just the leaders, 
but the agents in the field that the adventurers might 
encounter? Where are they active, and where do they 
have headquarters or strongholds? If adventurers do 
join, what kind of missions might they be sent on? What 
rewards can they gain? 
RENOWN 
Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an 
adventurer's standing within a particular faction or 
organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts 
at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and 
reputation within a particular organization. You can tie 
benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and 
titles within the organization and access to resources. 
A player tracks renown separately for each 
organization his or her character is a member of. For 
example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within 
one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the 
character's interaction with each organization over the 
course of the campaign. 
GAINING RENOWN 
A character earns renown by completing missions or 
quests that serve an organization's interests or involve 
the organization directly. You award renown at your 
discretion as characters complete these missions 
or quests, typically at the same time you award 
experience points.

CHAPTER l I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
Advancing an organization's interests increases 
a character's renown within that organization by 1. 
Completing a mission specifically assigned by that 
organization, or which directly benefits the organization, 
increases the character's renown by 2 instead. 
For example, characters with connections to the noble 
Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which 
they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. 
Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might 
increase each character's renown within the order 
by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission 
given to the adventurers by a senior member of the 
order, completing the task might instead increase each 
character's renown by 2, showing the adventurers as 
effective allies. 
Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box 
of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to 
a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might 
increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 
since this action directly increased that group's power 
and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an 
agent of the Zhentarim. 
BENEFITS OF RENOWN 
The benefits of increasing renown within an 
organization can include rank and authority, friendly 
attitudes from members of the organization, and 
other perks. 
Rank. Characters can earn promotions as their 
renown increases. You can establish certain thresholds 
of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not 
necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in 
rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. 
For example, a character might join the Lords' Alliance 
after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining 
the title of cloak. As the character's renown within the 
organization increases, he or she might be eligible for 
further increases in rank. 
You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a 
character affiliated with the Lords' Alliance might have 
to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at 
least lOth level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level 
to be a lioncrown. 
You can set these thresholds of renown to any 
numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate 
ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign. 
Attitudes of Organization Members. As a character's 
renown within an organization grows, members of 
that organization are increasingly likely to have heard 
of the character. You can set thresholds at which the 
default attitude of an organization's members toward 
the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For 
example, members of the Emerald Enclave- a faction
