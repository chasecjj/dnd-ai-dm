Effect

centered on the target. If grass is already there, 
it grows to ten times its normal size and remains 
overgrown for 1 minute. 
63- 65 
An object of the DM 's choice disappears into the 
Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn 
nor carried, within 120 feet of the target, and no 
larger than 10 feet in any dimension.

reduce on yourself.

You cast fireball. 
80-84 
You cast invisibility on yourself.

Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point in 
space as the target, leaves sprout from the creature 
nearest to that point. Unless they are picked off, 
the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours. 
88- 90 
A stream of 1 d4 x 10 gems, each worth 1 gp, 
shoots from the wand 's tip in a line 30 feet long 
and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning 
damage, and the total damage of the gems is 
divided equally among all creatures in the line. 
91-95 
A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from 
you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in 
the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on 
itself on a success. 
96-97 
The target's skin turns bright blue fo r 1d10 days. If 
you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to 
that point is affected . 
98-00 
If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw. If you didn't target a 
creature, you become the target and must make 
the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or 
more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other 
failed save, the target is restrained and begins to 
turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the 
target must repeat the saving throw at the end of 
its next turn , becoming petrified on a failure or 
ending the effect on a success. The petrification 
lasts until the target is freed by the greater 
restoration spell or similar magic. 
TRIDENT OF WARNING 
WEAPON, +1, +2, OR +3 
Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) 
You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the 
weapon's rarity. 
WEAPON OF WARNING 
Weapon (any), uncommon (requires attunement) 
This magic weapon warns you of danger. While 
the weapon is on your person, you have advantage 
on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your 
companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, 
except when incapacitated by something other than 
nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you 
and your companions within range if any of you are 
sleeping naturally when combat begins. 
WELL OF MANY WORLDS 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the 
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular 
sheet 6 feet in diameter. 
You can use an action to unfold and place the well of 
many worlds on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a 
two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. 
Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides 
where it leads. You can use an action to close an open 
portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and 
folding it up. Once well of many worlds has opened a 
portal, it can't do so again for ld8 hours. 
WIND FAN 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the 
gust of wind spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the 
fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each 
time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 
percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, 
nonmagical tatters.
