Stygia is also home to its previous ruler, the 
serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed 
by Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus 
to regain his rule. Geryon's fall from grace has 
spurred much debate within the infernal courts. No 
one is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret 
cause to dismiss the archdevil or whether he is testing 
Geryon's allegiance for some greater purpose. 
Malbolge. Malbolge, the sixth layer, has outlasted 
many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess 
and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of favor and 
was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while 
her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on 
the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus's 
favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the 
sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the 
layer break off from time to time, creating deadly and 
deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of 
.Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves 
carved into the mountainside. 
Malbolge's current archduchess is Asmodeus's 
daughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with 
her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She 
inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from 
her father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on 
the slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars 
and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of 
collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with 
cells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and 
torments those who displease her. 
Maladomini. The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin-
covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban 
landscape, and between them lie empty quarries, 
crumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of 
empty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies. 
The Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul, 
the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower 
body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul's form was 
inflicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for 
wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and 
degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to 
usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries 
a curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to 
calamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor 
for reasons no other archduke can fathom, though some 
suspect that the Archduke of Ness us still respects the 
worthiness of this fallen adversary. 
Cania. Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is 
an icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh from 
bone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for 
guests and prisoners of Cania's ruler, the brilliant and 
conniving archdevil Mephistopheles. 
Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, 
where he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and 
conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus's greatest enemy 
and ally, and the Archduke of Ness us appears to 
trust Mephistopheles's counsel when it is offered. 
Mephistopheles knows he can't depose Asmodeus until 
his adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so 
both wait to see what circumstances might turn them

against each other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of 
sorts to Glasya, further complicating the relationship. 
Mephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive 
horns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, asv o 
other archdevils, but he rarely gives his time to any 
creatures not worthy of his person~! ~ttention .. His 
instincts are as razor sharp as Camas fngtd wmds, 
and it is said that only Asmodeus has ever d~vea or 
thwarted him. 
/ 
Nessus. The lowest layer of the Nine"'Hells, Ness us is 
a realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses. 
There, pit fiend generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison 
their diabolical legions and p)ot the conquest of the 
multiverse. At the center oUhe layer stands a vast 
rift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great 
citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his 
infernal court. 
Malsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out 
stalagmite. The citadel is also a prison for souls that 
Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. Convincing 
him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep 
price, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has 
claimed whole kingdoms in the past for such favors. 
Asmodeus most often appears as a handsome, 
bearded humanoid with small horns protruding from 
his forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes. 
He can also assume other forms and is seldom seen 
without his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is 
the most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The 
ultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he 
wills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies into a rage. 
ACHERON 
Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron 
cubes floating in an airy void. Sometimes the cubes 
collide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the 
plane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding. 
That's the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the 
spirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against 
orcs devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet, 
and legions assembled by other warmongering gods. 
OPTIONAL RULE: BLOODLUST 
Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures 
by imbuing that creature with the strength to keep 
fighting. While on Acheron, a creature gains temporary 
hit points equal to half its hit point maximum whenever 
it reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTTVERSE 
MECHANUS 
On Meehan us, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork 
gears. all interlocked and turning according to their 
measure. The cogs seem to be engaged in a calculation 
so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose. Mechanus 
embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on 
those who spend time here. 
Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus. 
The plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a 
godlike being called Primus. 
OPTIONAL RULE: LAW OF AVERAGES 
While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average 
damage result for attacks and spells. For example, an 
attack that normally deals ldlO + 5 damage always 
deals 10 damage on Mechanus. 
OPTIONAL RULE: IMPOSING ORDER 
At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor 
that isn't lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment 
changes to lawful neutral. The creature's alignment 
reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other 
than Mechanus. Casting the dispel evil and good spell 
on the creature also restores its original alignment. 
ARCADI~A~---------------------­
Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees, 
ruler-straight streams, orderly fields, perfect roads, and 
cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The 
mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on 
Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless 
form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing 
intrudes on harmony. 
Night and day are determined by an orb that floats 
above Arcadia's highest peak. Half of the orb radiates 
sunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds 
moonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb 
rotates evenly without fail, spreading day and night 
across the entire plane. 
The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied 
demigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the 
Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen. 
Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of 
weather that king or queen controls. 
Hidden below Arcadia's beautiful mountains are 
numerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood 
the passage of millennia. Dwarves born on this plane
