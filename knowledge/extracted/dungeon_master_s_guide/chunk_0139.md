Potion, rare

2d4 + 2 
4d4 + 4 
8d4 + 8 
10d4 + 20 
For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit 
points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you 
are under the effect of the bless spell (no concentration 
required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as 
if boiling. 
POTION OF INVISIBILITY 
Potion, very rare 
This potion's container looks empty but feels as though 
it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible 
for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with 
you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. 
POTION OF INVULNERABILITY 
Potion, rare 
For 1 minute after you drink this potion, you have 
resistance to all damage. The potion's syrupy liquid 
looks like liquified iron. 
POTION OF LONGEVITY 
Potion, very rare 
When you drink this potion, your physical age is 
reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. 
Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, 
there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead 
age by 1d6 + 6 years. Suspended in this amber liquid 
are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, 
and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. 
These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened. 
POTION OF MIND READING 
Potion, rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the 
detect thoughts spell (save DC 13). The potion's dense, 
purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it. 
POTION OF POISON 
Potion, uncommon 
This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of 
healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actpally 
poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell 
reveals its true nature. 
If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you 
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or 
be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you 
are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. 
At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the 
saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage 
you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. 
The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.

POTION OF VITALITY 
Potion, very rare 
When you drink this potion, it removes any exhaustion 
you are suffering and cures any disease or poison 
affecting you. For the next 24 hours, you regain the 
maximum number of hit points for any Hit Die you 
spend. The potion's crimson liquid regularly pulses wi--
dulllight, calling to mind a heartbeat. 
POTION OF WATER BREATHING 
Potion, uncommon

this potion. Its cloudy green fluid smells of the sea and 
has a jellyfish-like bubble floating in it. 
QUAAL'S FEATHER TOKEN

feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use

Anchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a 
boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be 
moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel 
again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token 
disappears. 
Bird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet 
into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, 
multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the 
statistics of a roc (see the Monster Manual), but it obeys 
your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry 
up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed 
(16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day. 
with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,00G
