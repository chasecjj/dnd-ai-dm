CONTESTS 
A contest is a kind of ability check that matches 
two creatures against each other. Use a contest if a 
character attempts something that either directly foils 
or is directly opposed by another creature's efforts. In a 
contest, the ability checks are compared to each other, 
rather than to a target number. 
When you call for a contest, you pick the ability that 
each side must use, deciding whether both sides use the 
same ability or whether different abilities should counter 
each other. For example, when a creature tries to hide, it 
engages in a contest of Dexterity against Wisdom. But if 
two creatures arm wrestle, or if one creature is holding 
a door closed against another's attempt to push it open, 
both use Strength.

-----
------------
Call for an attack roll when a character tries to hit a 
creature or an object with an attack, especially when 
the attack could be foiled by the target's armor or shield 
or by another object providing cover. You can also use 
attack rolls to resolve noncombat activities such as 
archery contests or a game of darts. 
SAVING THROWS 
A saving throw is an instant response to a harmful effect 
and is almost never done by choice. A save makes the 
most sense when something bad happens to a character 
and the character has a chance to avoid that effect. An 
ability check is something a character actively attempts 
to accomplish, whereas a saving throw is a split-second 
response to the activity of someone or something else. 
Most of the time, a saving throw comes into play when 
an effect-such as a spell, monster ability, or trap-calls 
for it, telling you what kind of saving throw is involved 
and providing a DC for it. 
Other times, a situation arises that clearly calls for a 
saving throw, especially when a character is subjected 
to a harmful effect that can't be hedged out by armor or 
a shield. It's up to you to decide which ability score is 
involved. The Saving Throws table offers suggestions. 
INTELLIGENCE CHECK VS. WISDOM CHECK 
If you have trouble deciding whether to call for an Intelli-
gence or a Wisdom check to determine whether a character 
notices something, think of it in terms of what a very high or 
low score in those two abilities might mean. 
A character with a high Wisdom but low Intelligence is 
aware of the surroundings but is bad at interpreting what 
things mean. The character might spot that one section of 
a wall is clean and dusty compared to the others, but he or 
she wouldn't necessarily make the deduction that a secret 
door is there. 
In contrast, a character with high Intelligence and low 
Wisdom is probably oblivious but clever. The character might 
not spot the clean section of wall but, if asked about it, could 
immediately deduce why it's clean. 
Wisdom checks allow characters to perceive what is 
around them (the wall is clean here), while Intelligence 
checks answer why things are that way (there's probably a 
secret door).

CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 
DIFFICULTY CLASS 
It's your job to establish the Difficulty Class for an abili _ 
check or a saving throw when a rule or an adventure 
doesn't give you one. Sometimes you'll even want to 
change such established DCs. When you do so, think o: 
how difficult a task is and then pick the associated DC 
from the Typical DCs table. 
TYPICAL DCs 
Task 
DC 
Task 
DC 
Very easy 
5 
Hard 
20 
Easy 
10 
Very hard 
25 
Moderate 
15 
Nearly impossible 
30 
The numbers associated with these categories of 
difficulty are meant to be easy to keep in your head, 
so that you don't have to refer to this book every time 
you decide on a DC. Here are some tips for using DC 
categories at.the gaming table. 
If you've decided that an ability check is called for, 
then most likely the task at hand isn't a very easy 
one. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task with 
little chance of failure. Unless circumstances are 
unusual, let characters succeed at such a task without 
making a check. 
Then ask yourself, "Is this task's difficulty easy, 
moderate, or hard?" If the only DCs you ever use are 1C 
15, and 20, your game will run just fine. Keep in mind 
that a character with a 10 in the associated ability and 
no proficiency will succeed at an easy task around 50 
percent of the time. A moderate task requires a higher 
score or proficiency for success, whereas a hard task 
typically requires both. A big dose of luck with the d20 
also doesn't hurt. 
If you find yourself thinking, "This task is especially 
hard," you can use a higher DC, but do so with caution 
and consider the level of the characters. A DC 25 task 
is very hard for low-level characters to accomplish, bu-
it becomes more reasonable after lOth level or so. A 
DC 30 check is nearly impossible for most low-level 
characters. A 20th-level character with proficiency and -
relevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19 or 20 on the 
die roll to succeed at a task of this difficulty.
