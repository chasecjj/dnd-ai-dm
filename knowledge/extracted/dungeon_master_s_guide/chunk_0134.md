M AC E OF TERROR 
Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) 
This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, 
you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a 
wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foo 
radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 
1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature 
must spend its turns trying to move as far away from y _ 
as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 
30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action 
it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an 
effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it 
can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the 
end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the savin; 
throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
The mace regains 1d3 expended charges 
daily at dawn.

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on 
the table, working without interruption with the manual 
at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You 
must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies. 
Once you finish creating the golem, the book is 
consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes 
animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on 
it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys 
your spoken commands. See the Monster Manual for its 
game statistics. 
M ANUAL OF QUICKNESS OF ACTION 
Wondrous item, very rare 
This book contains coordination and balance exercises, 
and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 
48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying 
rhe book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your 
Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum 
for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but 
regains it in a century. 
M ARINER's ARMOR 
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), uncommon 
While wearing this armor, you have a swimming speed 
equal to your walking speed. In addition, whenever you 
start your turn underwater with 0 hit points, the armor 
causes you to rise 60 feet toward the surface. The armor 
is decorated with fish and shell motifs. 
M EDALLION OF THOUGHTS 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can 
use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the detect 
thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion 
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. 
M IRROR OF LIFE TRAPPING 
Wondrous item, very rare 
When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its 
surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror 
weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and 
vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is 
destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. 
If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you 
are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its 
command word and activate it. It remains activated until 
you use an action to speak the command word again. 
Any creature other than you that sees its reflection 
in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must 
succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be 
trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in 
one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This 
saving throw is made with advantage if the creature 
knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on 
the saving throw automatically. 
An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled 
with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures 
trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't 
need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within 
a cell can escape using magic that permits planar 
travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell 
until freed.
