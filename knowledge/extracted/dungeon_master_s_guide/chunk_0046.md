MOUNT CELESTIA 
The single sacred mountain of Mount Celestia rises 
from a shining Silver Sea to heights barely visible and 
utterly incomprehensible, with seven plateaus marking 
its seven heavenly layers. The plane is the model of 
justice and order, of celestial grace and endless mercy, 
where angels and champions of good guard against 
incursions of evil. It is one of the few places on the 
planes where travelers can let down their guard. Its 
inhabitants strive constantly to be as righteous as 
possible. Countless creatures aim to reach the highest 
and most sublime peak of the mountain, but only the 
purest souls can. Gazing toward that peak fills even the 
most jaded of travelers with awe. 
OPTIONAL RULE: BLESSED BENEFICENCE 
In contrast to the dissonance experienced by evil 
creatures here, good creatures are literally blessed by 
the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures of 
good alignment gain the benefit of the bless spell as long 
as they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long 
rest on the plane grants a good creature the benefit of a 
lesser restoration spell. 
BYTOPIA 
The two layers of the Twin Paradises of Bytopia are 
similar yet opposite: one is a tamed, pastoral landscape 
and the other an untamed wilderness, yet both reflect 
the plane's goodness and its acceptance of law and 
order when necessary. Bytopia is the heaven of 
productive work, the satisfaction of a job well done. The 
goodness flowing through the plane creates feelings of 
goodwill and happiness in creatures dwelling there. 
OPTIONAL RULE : PERVASIVE GOODWILL 
At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a
