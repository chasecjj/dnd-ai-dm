CAPE OF" THE 
MouNTEBANK 
CANDLE OF INVOCATION 
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) 
This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares 
that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can 
be detected with the detect evil and good spell. The 
DM chooses the god and associated alignment or 
determines the alignment randomly.

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, 
which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the 
candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at 
a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 
1 minute from the candle's total burn time. 
While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot 
radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment 
matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving 
throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a 
cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the 
candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared 
without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is 
as if cast with a 1st-level slot. 
Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first 
time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so 
destroys the candle. 
CAP OF WATER BREATHING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
While wearing this cap underwater, you can speak its 
command word as an action to create a bubble of air

around your head. It allows you to breathe normally 
underwater. This bubble stays with you until you speak 
the command word again, the cap is removed, or you are 
no longer underwater. 
CAPE OF THE MOUNTEBANK 
Wondrous item, rare 
This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing 
it, you can use it to cast the dimension door spell as an 
action. This property of the cape can't be used again 
until the next dawn. 
When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of 
smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at 
your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space 
you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates 
at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind 
disperses the smoke. 
CARPET OF FLYING 
Wondrous item, very rare 
You can speak the carpet's command word as an action 
to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to 
your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 
feet of it. 
Four sizes of carpet of flying exist. The DM chooses 
the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly.

A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on 
the table, but it flies at half speed if it carries more than 
its normal capacity.
