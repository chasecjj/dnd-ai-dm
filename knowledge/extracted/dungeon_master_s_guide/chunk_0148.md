RoPE oF 
ENTANGLEMENT 
by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength 
or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the 
creature is no longer restrained by the rope. 
The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 
hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit 
point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. 
SADDLE OF THE CAVALIER 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
While in this saddle on a mount, you can't be 
dismounted against your will if you're conscious, and 
attack rolls against the mount have disadvantage. 
S CARAB OF PROTECTION 
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) 
If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 
1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing 
its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on 
your person: 
You have advantage on saving throws against spells. 
The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw 
against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect 
originating from an undead creature, you can use 
your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed 
save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles 
into powder and is destroyed when its last charge 
is expended. 
SCIMITAR OF SPEED 
Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement) 
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one 
attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns. 
SCROLL OF PROTECTION 
Scroll, rare 
Each scroll of protection works against a specific type of 
creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly by 
rolling on the following table. 
dlOO 
Creature Type 
dlOO 
Creature Type 
01-10 
Aberrations 
41-50

51-75 
Fiends 
21-30 
Celestials 
76-80 
Plants 
31-40 
Elementals 
81-00 
Undead 
Using an action to read the scroll encloses you in a 
invisible barrier that extends from you to form a 5-foot-
radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier 
prevents creatures of the specified type from entering or 
affecting anything within the cylinder. 
The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on 
you. However, if you move in such a way that a creature 
of the specified type would be inside the cylinder, the 
effect ends. 
A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by 
using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. 
On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by 
the barrier. 
SENDING STONES 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
Sending stones come in pairs, with each smooth stone 
carved to match the other so the pairing is easily 
recognized. While you touch one stone, you can use an 
action to cast the sending spell from it. The target is the 
bearer of the other stone. If no creature bears the other 
stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone 
and don't cast the spell. 
Once sending is cast through the stones, they can't be 
used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a 
pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical. 
SENTINEL SHIELD 
Armor (shield), uncommon 
While holding this shield, you have advantage on 
initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks. The 
shield is emblazoned with a symbol of an eye.
