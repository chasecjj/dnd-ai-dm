Suspects might be obvious or could come to light during 
the investigation. One technique often used in detective 
fiction is to create a closed circle of suspects-a finite 
number of individuals whose circumstances make them 
the only possible suspects. 
One tip for keeping the players and the adventurers 
guessing as to the identity of the villain is to ensure that 
more than one suspect has a secret. When questioned 
by the adventurers, a suspect might appear nervous or 
attempt to lie, despite being innocent of the crime. A 
secret business deal, an illicit affair, a dark past, or an 
uncontrolled vice are flaws that make suspects more 
interesting than NPCs with nothing to hide. 
CLUES 
Clues point to the identity of the villain. Some clues are 
verbal, including the statements of the suspects and 
witnesses that help the adventurers develop a picture 
of what happened. Other clues are physical, such as an 
unfinished message written in the victim's blood, a piece 
of jewelry left behind by the villain, or a weapon found 
hidden in a suspect's room. 
A clue should connect a suspect to the crime, typically 
by shedding light on the suspect's motive, means, or 
opportunity. Some clues connect the wrong suspect 
to the crime, leading the adventurers in the wrong 
direction. Eventually, they must find other clues pointing 
in a different direction, or come across evidence that 
absolves the suspect. 
It's better to populate your adventure with too many 
clues than too few. If the adventurers solve the mystery 
too quickly, you might feel some disappointment but 
the players will feel a sense of accomplishment. If the 
mystery is too hard, though, the players will become 
frustrated. Since you have to account for the possibility 
that the adventurers will overlook some clues, use 
redundant clues to ensure that the players have the 
knowledge needed to catch the villain. 
INTRIGUE ----
Intrigue adventures are event-based adventures that 
revolve around power struggles. Intrigues are common 
in the courts of the nobility, but power struggles can 
play out just as easily in merchants' guilds, crime 
syndicates, and temple hierarchies. 
Rather than dark events and villainous plots, an 
intrigue adventure typically revolves around the 
exchange of favors, the rise and fall of individuals 
in power and influence, and the honeyed words of 
diplomacy. A prince's efforts to be named heir to the 
throne, a courtier's ambition to sit at the queen's right 
hand, and a merchant's desire to open a trade route 
through enemy lands are the stuff of intrigue. 
Like all adventures, an intrigue adventure works only 
if the players and their characters are invested in the 
outcome. If no one cares who the king's chamberlain is 
or who has logging rights in the elven woods, throwing 
the characters into an adventure centered on those 
issues will fall fiat. However, if having the ear of the 
king's chamberlain means the characters can use royal 
soldiers to help them defend their own stronghold on the 
borderlands, players will be invested in the scenario. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES 
Adventurers usually become embroiled in intrigue 
when they need a favor from a powerful creature and 
have to perform a favor in exchange, or when the plots 
of powerful NP Cs get in the way of the characters 
achieving their goals. Some of the event-based goals 
discussed earlier in this section lend themselves to 
intrigue adventures. For example, if the adventurers 
must uncover a conspiracy, negotiate a peace treaty, or 
secure aid from a ruler or council, you might be looking 
at an intrigue adventure. 
The process of creating an intrigue adventure is 
similar to creating any other event-based adventure, 
with two main differences: how villains are handled and 
how the characters can gain influence. 
VILLAINS 
Some intrigue adventures are driven by the actions of a 
single villain, such as a noble plotting the assassination 
of a monarch. However, an intrigue adventure can have 
multiple villains or no villain at all. 
No Villain. Some intrigue adventures revolve around 
the exchange of favors in the absence of a villain. For 
this type of adventure, skip steps 1 and 2 of the event-
based adventure creation process (the villain and the 
villain's actions) and move straight to the adventurers' 
goals in step 3. Figure out why the adventurers become 
involved in the intrigue, then spend the bulk of your time 
creating the NPCs they interact with. 
Many Villains. Some intrigue adventures feature 
a whole cast of villains, each with its own goals, 
motivations, and methods. The adventurers might be 
drawn into the struggle of a court full of nobles vying 
for the throne in the wake of the king's sudden death, 
or could find themselves negotiating the end to a deadly 
turf war among thieves' guilds. In this scenario, you'll 
spend a lot of time on steps 1 and 2, developing each of 
the major NPCs as a distinct villain with an agenda. 
In step 5, you'll need to develop each villain's reactions 
to the potential setbacks they face during the adventure. 
However, you don't need to put equal effort into detailing 
the reactions of every villain, since many will likely 
echo each other or cancel each other out. Whenever 
the adventurers foil one villain's plans, it might let 
another villain's schemes move forward, advancing the 
adventure whether the foiled villain reacts or not. 
INFLUENCE 
Depending on the scenario, you might want to track 
the party's influence with different NPCs or factions, or 
even track influence separately for each character. 
One way to handle influence is to treat it like 
inspiration. A character gains influence in a certain 
situation only if you grant it, and bringing influence 
into play requires spending it. Characters can gain 
influence by doing favors for NPCs, advancing the 
cause of an organization, or demonstrating their power 
and heroism, at your discretion. As with inspiration, 
a character can choose to spend influence to gain 
advantage on a roll relevant to that influence. 
Another way to handle influence is to treat it like 
renown (see chapter 1), allowing characters to gain 
renown at court and within various key factions.
