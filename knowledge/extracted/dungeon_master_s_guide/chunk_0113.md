BAG OF 
DEVOURING 
BAG O F DEVOURING 
Wondrous item, very rare 
This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a 
feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. 
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice. 
The extradimensional creature attached to the bag 
can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or 
vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured 
and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed 
in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, 
there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled 
inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its 
action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength 
check. Another creature can use its action to reach into 
the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful 
DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the 
bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag 
is devoured, its body destroyed. 
Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which 
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once 
each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and 
spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM 
determines the time and plane. 
If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and 
anything contained within it is transported to a random 
location on the Astral Plane. 
BAG OF HOLDING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This bag has an interior space considerably larger 
than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter 
at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 
500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. 
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. 
Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. 
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures 
and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the
