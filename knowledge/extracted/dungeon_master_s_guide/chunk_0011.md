_ lost settlements are agricultural villages, supporting 
themselves and nearby towns or cities with crops and 
meat. Villagers produce food in one way or another-if 
not by tending the crops, then supporting those who do 
by shoeing horses, weaving clothes, milling grain, and 
the like. The goods they produce feed their families and 
upply trade with nearby settlements. 
A village's population is dispersed around a large area 
of land. Farmers live on their land, which spreads them 
videly around the village center. At the heart of the 
\·illage, a handful of structures cluster together: a well, 
a marketplace, a small temple or two, a gathering place, 
and perhaps an inn for travelers. 
TowN 
Population: Up to about 6,000 
Government: A resident noble rules and appoints a lord 
mayor to oversee administration. An elected town 
council represents the interests of the middle class. 
Defense: The noble commands a sizable army of 
professional soldiers, as well as personal bodyguards. 
Commerce: Basic supplies are readily available, though 
exotic goods and services are harde·r to find. Inns and 
taverns support travelers. 
Organizations: The town contains several temples, 
as well as various merchant guilds and other 
organizations. 
Towns are major trade centers, situated where important 
industries and reliable trade routes enabled the 
population to grow. These settlements rely on commerce: 
!.he import of raw materials and food from surrounding 
·illages, and the export of crafted items to those villages, 
as well as to other towns and cities. A town's population 
i more diverse than that of most villages. 
Towns arise where roads intersect waterways, at the 
meeting of major land trade routes, around strategic 
defensive locations, or near significant mines or similar 
natural resources. 
C ITY 
Population: Up to about 25,000 
Government: A resident noble presides, with several 
other nobles sharing responsibility for surrounding 
areas and government functions. One such noble is 
the lord mayor, who oversees the city administration. 
An elected city council represents the middle class 
and might hold more actual power than the lord 
mayor. Other groups serve as important power 
centers as well. 
Defense: The city supports an army of professional 
soldiers, guards, and town watch. Each noble in 
residence maintains a small force of personal 
bodyguards. 
Commerce: Almost any goods or services are readily 
available. Many inns and taverns support travelers. 
Organizations: A multitude of temples, guilds, and 
other organizations, some of which hold significant 
power in city affairs, can be found within the 
city's walls. 
Cities are cradles of civilization. Their larger 
populations require considerable support from both 
urrounding villages and trade routes, so they're rare. 
Cities typically thrive in areas where large expanses 
of fertile, arable land surround a location accessible to 
trade, almost always on a navigable waterway. 
Cities almost always have walls, and the stages of a 
city's growth are easily identified by the expansion of 
the walls beyond the central core. These internal walls 
naturally divide the city into wards (neighborhoods 
defined by specific features), which have their own 
representatives on the city council and their own noble 
administrators. 
Cities that hold more than twenty-five thousand people 
are extremely rare. Metropolises such as Waterdeep in 
the Forgotten Realms, Sharn in Eberron, and the Free 
City of Greyhawk stand as vital beacons of civilization in 
the D&D worlds. 
ATMOSPHERE 
-------
What do the adventurers first notice as they approach 
or enter a settlement? The towering wall bristling 
with soldiers? The beggars with hands outstretched, 
pleading for aid outside the gate? The noisy hubbub of 
merchants and buyers thronging the market square? 
The overpowering stench of manure? 
Sensory details help bring a settlement to life and 
vividly communicate its personality to your players. 
Settle on a single defining factor that sums up a 
settlement's personality and extrapolate from there. 
Maybe a city is built around canals, like real-world 
Venice. That key element suggests a wealth of sensory 
details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy 
waters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing 
gondoliers, the smells of fish and waste polluting 
the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is 
shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the 
tendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and 
cranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones, 
the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of 
mystery and lurking danger. 
The climate and terrain of a settlement's environment, 
its origin and inhabitants, its government and political 
position, and its commercial importance all have a 
bearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against 
the edge of a jungle has a very different feel than one 
on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present 
a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to 
human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell 
any hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city 
fostering an early system of democracy might boast an 
open-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as 
freely as produce. All the possible combinations of these 
factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of 
your campaign world. 
GOVERNMENT 
In the feudal society common in most D&D worlds, 
power and authority are concentrated in towns and 
cities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements 
where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect 
taxes from the populace, which they use for public 
building projects, to pay the soldiery, and to support a 
comfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles
