Also, characters and monsters with distinctive voices 
are memorable. If you're not a natural mimic or actor, 
borrowing distinctive speech patterns from real life, the 
movies, or television is a good place to start. Practice 
different voices and impersonations of famous people, 
then use those voices to bring your NPCs to life. 
Experiment with different speech patterns. For 
instance, a barmaid and a city magistrate probably use 
their words differently. Similarly, peasants could speak 
in earthy dialects, while rich folk talk in haughty drawls. 
Let a pirate NPC say, "Arrrr, maties!" in your best Long 
John Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters unfamiliar 
with Common stumble along with awkward grammar. 
Let drunkards and monsters mutter with slurred 
speech, while lizardfolk hiss their threats. 
In any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure 
the adventurers remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk 
to them, not so much to each other. If possible, let one 
NPC do most of the talking, but if multiple NPCs need 
to talk, give them distinct voices so the players know 
who's who. 
UsiNG YouR FAcE AND ARMS 
Use your facial expressions to help show a character's 
emotions. Scowl, smile, grin, snarl, pout, cross your 
eyes-do whatever it takes to make the character or 
monster memorable to the players. When you combine 
facial expressions with an unusual voice, a character 
truly comes to life. 
Though you don't need to stand up out of your chair, 
you can use your arms to bring even more life to an 
NPC. A noble could chop the air with one hand while 
speaking in a deadpan monotone, while an archmage 
might express her displeasure by silently rolling her 
eyes and massaging her temples with her fingers. 
ENGAGING THE PLAYERS 
Some players enjoy roleplaying and interaction more 
than others. Whatever your players' tastes, your 
lively portrayal of NPCs and monsters can inspire 
players to make just as much investment in portraying 
their characters. This makes social interactions an 
opportunity for everyone to become more immersed 
in the game, creating a story whose protagonists 
have depth. 
To make sure everyone has something to do during a 
roleplaying-heavy game session, consider one or more of 
the following approaches. 
Appeal to Player Preferences. There are in-game 
activities that players enjoy more than others, as 
discussed in this book's introduction. Players who like 
acting thrive in interaction situations, and it's fine to ·let 
those players take the spotlight. They often inspire other 
players by their example, but make sure those other 
players have an opportunity to join in the fun. 
Players who like exploring and storytelling are 
usually amenable to roleplaying, as long as it moves the 
campaign forward and reveals more about the world. 
Players who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring 
out the right thing to say to shift an NPC's attitude. 
Players who are instigators like provoking reactions 
from NPCs, so they're often easily engaged-though not 
always productively. 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 
Players who like to optimize their characters and 
slay monsters also like to argue, and having conflict 
within an interaction can help those players embrace 
roleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an 
extended interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending 
assassins to kill the adventurers) is often the best way r 
keep action-focused players engaged. 
Target Specific Characters. Create situations where 
characters who might not otherwise be engaged with a 
social interaction have to do at least some of the talk in 
Perhaps the NPC in question is a family member or 
a contact of a particular adventurer and talks only to 
that character. An NPC of a certain race or class mighr 
listen only to characters he or she feels a kinship with. 
Creating a sense of importance can be a great way to ge-
specific players engaged, but don't shut out players who 
are already roleplaying. 
If a couple of players are dominating the conversation 
take a moment now and then to involve the others. You 
can do this in character if you like: "And what about you;-
hulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will you pledge 
in exchange for my favor?" Or just ask the player what 
his or her character is doing while the conversation is 
going on. The first approach is better for players who are 
already comfortable speaking in their characters' voices 
The second approach works better for players who neeri 
encouragement to engage in a roleplaying scenario. 
OBJECTS 
When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a 
window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and 
fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, 
characters can destroy any destructible object. Use 
common sense when determining a character's succe 
at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a 
section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is 
likely to break before the wall does. 
For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete. 
inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, 
table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is 
composed of many other objects. 
STATISTICS FOR OBJECTS 
When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class 
and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give 
it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific 
types of damage. 
Armor Class. An object's Armor Class is a measure 
of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when 
striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging 
out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides 
suggested AC values for various substances.
