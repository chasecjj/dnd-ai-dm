any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the 
location of your prison. You draw no more cards. 
Euryale. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. 
You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in 
this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can 
end this curse. 
The Fates. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, 
allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never 
happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you 
draw the card or at any other time before you die. 
Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The 
devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring 
your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity 
lasts until either you or the devil dies. 
Fool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw 
from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your 
declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you 
to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves 
you with just enough XP to keep your level. 
Gem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 
gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at 
your feet. 
Idiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by ld4 + 1 
(to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional 
card beyond your declared draws. 
jester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two 
additional cards beyond your declared draws. 
Key. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you 
are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses 
the weapon. 
Knight. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who 
appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The 
fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally 
until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to 
you. You control this character. 
Moon. You are granted the ability to cast the wish 
spell 1d3 times. 
Rogue. A nonplayer character of the DM's choice 
becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new 
enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else 
reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine 
intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. 
Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, 
other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable 
property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you 
own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any 
documentation that proves you should own something 
lost to this card also disappears. 
Skull. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly 
humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and 
carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of 
the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks yo~, 
warning all others that you must win the battle alone. 
The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, 
whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, 
the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature 
slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life. 
Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The 
score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24. 
Sun. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which 
the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.

(1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 
Turning Immunity. The avatar is immune to features that 
turn undead. 
ACTIONS 
Reaping Scythe. The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through 
a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing 
damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. 
Talons. Every magic item you wear or carry 
disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't 
destroyed but do vanish. 
Throne. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, 
and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made 
with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership 
of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the 
keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you 
must clear out before you can claim the keep as. yours. 
Vizier. At any time you choose within one year of 
drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation 
and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. 
Besides information, the answer helps you solve a 
puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the 
knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it. 
The Void. This black card spells disaster. Your soul 
is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a 
place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings 
guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, 
your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore 
your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object 
that holds it. You draw no more cards. 
DEFENDER 
Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement) 
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. 
The first time you attack with the sword on each of 
your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword's 
bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus 
on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce 
the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain 
a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect
