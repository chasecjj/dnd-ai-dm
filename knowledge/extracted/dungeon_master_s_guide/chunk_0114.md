Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents 
spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right 
before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside 
the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal 
to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 
minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. 
Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Heward's handy haversack, portable 
hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it 
to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then 
closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened. 
BAG OF TRICKS 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, 
appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, 
reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag 
weighs 1/2 pound. 
You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the 
bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, 
it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling 
a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the 
bag's color. See the Monster Manual for the creature's 
statistics. 
The creature is friendly to you and your companions, 
and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to 
command how the creature moves and what action it 
takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such 
as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, 
the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. 
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the 
bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in 
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads 
of force are found together. 
You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 
feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. 
Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead 
landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw 
or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent 
force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature 
that failed the save and is completely within the area is 
trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded 
on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed
