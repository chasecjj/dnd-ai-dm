farther than your remaining movement would allow.

magic missile spell. 
BROOM OF FLYING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions 
like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and 
speak its command word. It then hovers beneath you 
and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 
feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed 
becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The 
broom stops hovering when you land. 
You can send the broom to travel alone to a 
destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the 
command word, name the location, and are familiar 
with that place. The broom comes back to you when you 
speak another command word, provided that the broom 
is still within 1 mile of you.
