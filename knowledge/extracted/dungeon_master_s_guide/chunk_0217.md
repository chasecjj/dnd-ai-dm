The NPC Features table summarizes the ability 
modifiers and features of variou nonhuman races, as 
well as various creatures from the Monster Manual with 
a challenge rating lower than 1. Apply these modifiers 
and add these features to the 
PCs stat block, then 
determine the NPC's challenge rating just as you would 
for a monster. Features that can affect a monster's 
challenge rating are listed in the Monster Features table. 
The NPC's proficiency bonus is determined by its level, 
just like a character, rather than by its challenge rating. 
If the monster you want to use isn't listed on the table, 
use the process described below under "Monsters 
with Classes." 
MONSTERS WITH CLASSES 
You can use the rules in chapter 3 of the Player's 
Handbook to give class levels to a monster. For example, 
you can turn an ordinary werewolf into a werewolf with 
four levels of the barbarian class (such a monster would 
be expressed as "Werewolf, 4th-level barbarian"). 
Start with the monster's stat block. The monster gains 
all the class features for every class level you add, with 
the following exceptions: 
The monster doesn't gain the starting equipment of 
the added class. 
For each class level you add, the monster gains one 
Hit Die of its normal type (based on its size), ignoring 
the class's Hit Die progression. 
The monster's proficiency bonus is based on its 
challenge rating, not its class levels. 
Once you finish adding class levels to a monster, 
feel free to tweak its ability scores as you see fit (for 
example, raising the monster's Intelligence score so 
that the monster is a more effective wizard), and make 
whatever other adjustments are needed. You'll need 
to recalculate its challenge rating as though you had 
designed the monster from scratch. 
Depending on the monster and the number of class 
levels you add to it, its challenge rating might change 
very little or increase dramatically. For example, a 
werewolf that gains four barbarian levels is a much 
greater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit 
points, spells, and other class features that an ancient 
red dragon gains from five levels of wizard don't 
increase its challenge rating. 
CREATING A SPELL 
When creating a new spell, use existing spells as 
guidelines. Here are some things to consider: 
If a spell is so good that a caster would want to use it 
all the time, it might be too powerful for its level. 
A long duration or large area can make up for a lesser 
effect, depending on the spell. 
Avoid spells that have very limited use, such as one 
that works only against good dragons. Though such 
a spell could exist in the world, few characters will 
bother to learn or prepare it unless they know in 
advance that doing so will be worthwhile. 
• Make sure the spell fits with the identity of the class. 
Wizards and sorcerers don"t typically have access to 
healing spells, for example, and adding a healing spell 
to the wizard class list would step on the cleric's turf. 
SPELL DAMAGE 
-----------------------------
For any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage 
table to determine approximately how much damage is 
appropriate given the spell's level. The table assumes 
the spell deals half damage on a successful saving 
throw or a missed attack. If your spell doesn't deal 
damage on a successful save, you can increase the 
damage by 25 percent. 
You can use different damage dice than the ones 
in the table, provided that the average result is about 
the same. Doing so can add a little variety to the spell. 
For example, you could change a cantrip's damage 
from ldlO (average 5.5) to 2d4 (average 5), reducing 
the maximum damage and making an average result 
more likely.
