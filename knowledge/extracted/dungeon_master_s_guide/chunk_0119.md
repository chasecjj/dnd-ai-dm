Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of dim light or

Crystal Ball of Mind Reading. You can use an action 
to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 17) while you 
are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you

need to concentrate on this detect thoughts to maintain 
it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends. 
Crystal Ball of Telepathy. While scrying with the 
crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with 
creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's 
sensor. You can also use an action to cast the suggestion 
spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those 
creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this 
suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends 
if scrying ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the 
crystal ball can't be used again until the next dawn.
