BooTs OF 
ELVENKINO 
away from the center of the sphere until they are no 
longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through 
the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can. 
An enclosed creature can use its action to push 
against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half 
the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked 
up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, 
regardless of the weight of creatures inside. 
BELT OF DWARVENKIND 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits: 
Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a 
maximum of 20. 
You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks 
made to interact with dwarves. 
In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50 
percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard 
if you're capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker 
beard if you already have one. 
If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following additional 
benefits while wearing the belt: 
You have advantage on saving throws against poison, 
and you have resistance against poison damage. 
You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. 
You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish. 
BELT OF GIANT STRENGTH 
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement) 
While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to 
a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already 
equal to or greater than the belt's score, the item has no 
effect on you. 
Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and 
having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. 
The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant 
strength look different, but they have the same effect.

BERSERKER AxE 
Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement) 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are 
attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum 
increases by 1 for each level you have attained. 
Curse. This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it 
extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, 
you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within 
reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack 
rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is 
within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. 
Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the 
axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you 
must use your action each round to attack the creature 
nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra 
attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra 
attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after 
you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible 
targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until 
you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of 
you that you can see or hear. 
BOOTS OF ELVENKIND 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, 
regardless of the surface you are moving across. You 
also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that 
rely on moving silently. 
BOOTS OF LEVITATION 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
While you wear these boots, you can use an action to 
cast the levitate spell on yourself at will. 
BOOTS OF SPEED 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action 
and click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots 
double your walking speed, and any creature that makes 
an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on 
the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you 
end the effect. 
When the boots' property has been used for a total of 
10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish 
a long rest.
