VARIANT: AUTOMATIC SUCCESS 
Sometimes the randomness of a d20 roll leads to 
ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a successful 
DC 15 Strength check to be battered down. A fighter 
with a Strength of 20 might helplessly flail against the 
door because of bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with 
a Strength of 10 rolls a 20 and knocks the door from 
its hinges. 
If such results bother you, consider allowing 
automatic success on certain checks. Under this 
optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any 
ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant 
ability score minus 5. So in the example above, the 
fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule 
doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls. 
Having proficiency with a skill or tool can also 
grant automatic success. If a character's proficiency 
bonus applies to his or her ability check, the character 
automatically succeeds if the DC is 10 or less. If that 
character is 11th level or higher, the check succeeds if 
the DC is 15 or less. 
The downside of this whole approach is its 
predictability. For example, once a character's ability 
score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that 
ability become automatic successes. Smart players 
will then always match the character with the highest 
ability score against any given check. If you want some 
risk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, 
though, can aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: 
higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even 
more on luck. 
PROFICIENCY 
When you ask a player to make an ability check, 
consider whether a skill or tool proficiency might apply 
to it. The player might also ask you if a particular 
proficiency applies. 
One way to think about this question is to consider 
whether a character could become better at a particular 
task through training and practice. If the answer is 
no, it's fine to say that no proficiency applies. But if 
the answer is yes, assign an appropriate skill or tool 
proficiency to reflect that training and practice. 
SKILLS 
As described in the Player's Handbook, a skill 
proficiency represents a character's focus on one 
aspect of an ability. Among all the things a character's 
Dexterity score describes, the character might be 
particularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in 
proficiency in the Stealth skill. When that skill is used 
for an ability check, it is usually used with Dexterity. 
Under certain circumstances, you can decide a 
character's proficiency in a skill can be applied to a 
different ability check. For example, you might decide 
that a character forced to swim from an island to the 
mainland must succeed on a Constitution check (as 
opposed to a Strength check) because of the distance 
involved. The character is proficient in the Athletics 
skill, which covers swimming, so you allow the 
character's proficiency bonus to apply to this ability 
check. In effect, you're asking for a Constitution 
(Athletics) check, instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. 
Often, players ask whether they can apply a skill 
proficiency to an ability check. If a player can provide 
a good justification for why a character's training and 
aptitude in a skill should apply to the check, go ahead 
and allow it, rewarding the player's creative thinking. 
TOOLS 
Having proficiency with a tool allows you to apply 
your proficiency bonus to an ability check you make 
using that tool. For example, a character proficient 
with carpenter's tools can apply his or her proficiency 
bon.us to a Dexterity check to craft a wooden flute, an 
Intelligence check to craft a wooden secret door, or a 
Strength check to build a working trebuchet. However, 
the proficiency bonus wouldn't apply to an ability check 
made to identify unsafe wooden construction or to 
discern the origin of a crafted item, since neither check 
requires tool use. 
SAVING THROWS AND ATTACK ROLLS 
Characters are either proficient with a saving throw 
or attack, or they aren't. The bonus always applies if a 
character is proficient. 
ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE 
Advantage and disadvantage are among the most useful 
tools in your DM's toolbox. They reflect temporary 
circumstances that might affect the chances of a 
character succeeding or failing at a task. Advantage 
is also a great way to reward a player who shows 
exceptional creativity in play. 
Characters often gain advantage or disadvantage 
through the use of special abilities, actions, spells, or 
other features of their classes or backgrounds. In other 
cases, you decide whether a circumstance influences a 
roll in one direction or another, and you grant advantage 
or impose disadvantage as a result. 
Consider granting advantage when 000 
Circumstances not related to a creature's inherent 
capabilities provide it with an edge. 
Some aspect of the environment contributes to the 
character's chance of success. 
• A player shows exceptional creativity or cunning in 
attempting or describing a task. 
• Previous actions (whether taken by the character 
making the attempt or some other creature) improve 
the chances of success. 
Consider imposing disadvantage when 000 
• Circumstances hinder success in some way. 
• Some aspect of the environment makes success less 
likely (assuming that aspect doesn't already impose a 
penalty to the roll being made). 
• An element of the plan or description of an action 
makes success less likely. 
Because advantage and disadvantage cancel each 
other out, there's no need to keep track of how many 
circumstances weigh on both sides.
