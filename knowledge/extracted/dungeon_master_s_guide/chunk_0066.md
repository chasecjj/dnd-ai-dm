CHECKING FOR RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
You decide when a random encounter happens, or you 
roll. Consider checking for a random encounter once 
every hour, once every 4 to 8 hours, or once during the 
day and once during a long rest-whatever makes the 
most sense based on how active the area is. 
If you roll, do so with a d20. If the result is 18 or 
higher, a random encounter occurs. You then roll on an 
appropriate random encounter table to determine what 
the adventurers meet, rerolling if the die result doesn't 
make sense given the circumstances. 
Random encounter tables might be provided as part 
of the adventure you're running, or you can use the 
information in this chapter to build your own. Creating 
your own tables is the best way to reinforce the themes 
and flavor of your home campaign. 
Not every run-in with another creature counts as 
a random encounter. Encounter tables don't usually 
include rabbits hopping through the undergrowth, 
harmless rats scurrying through dungeon halls, or 
average citizens walking through the streets of a city. 
Random encounter tables present obstacles and events 
that advance the plot, foreshadow important elements or 
themes of the adventure, and provide fun distractions. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES 
CREATI NG R AN DOM E NCOUNTER TABLES 
Creating your own random encounter tables is 
straightforward. Determine what sort of encounters 
might occur in a given dungeon area, figure out the 
likelihood of a particular encounter occurring, then 
arrange the results. An "encounter" in this case could be 
a single monster or NPC, a group of monsters or NPCs, 
a random event (such as an earth tremor or a parade), 
or a random discovery (such as a charred corpse or a 
message scrawled on a wall). 
Assemble Your Encounters. Once you've established 
a location through which the adventurers are likely to 
pass, be it a wilderness area or dungeon complex, make 
a list of creatures that might be found wandering there. 
If you're not sure which creatures to include, appendix B 
has lists of monsters organized by terrain type. 
For a sylvan woodland, you might create a table 
that includes centaurs, faerie dragons, pixies, sprites, 
dryads, satyrs, blink dogs, elks, owlbears, treants, giant 
owls, and a unicorn. If elves inhabit the forest, the table 
might also include elf druids and elf scouts. Perhaps 
gnolls are threatening the woods, so adding gnolls and 
hyenas to the table would be a fun surprise for players. 
Another fun surprise would be a wandering predator, 
such as a displacer beast that likes to hunt blink dogs. 
The table could also use a few random encounters of 
a less monstrous nature, such as a grove of burned 
trees (the handiwork of the gnolls), an ivy-covered 
elven statue, and a plant with glowing berries that turn 
creatures invisible when ingested. 
When choosing monsters for a random encounter 
table, try to imagine why the monsters would be 
encountered outside their lairs. What is each monster 
up to? Is it on patrol? Hunting for food? Searching for 
something? Also consider whether a creature is moving 
stealthily as it travels through the area. 
As with planned encounters, random encounters 
are more interesting when they happen in memorable 
locations. Outdoors the adventurers might be crossing 
a forest clearing when they encounter a unicorn or 
be pushing through a dense section of forest when 
they come across a nest of spiders. Crossing a desert, 
characters might discover an oasis haunted by wights or 
a rocky outcropping on which a blue dragon perches. 
Probabilities. A random encounter table can be 
created in a number of ways, ranging from simple (roll 
ld6 for one of six possible encounters) to complicated 
(roll percentile dice, modify for time of day, and cross-
index the modified number with the dungeon level). The 
sample encounter table presented here uses a range of 
2 to 20 (nineteen entries total), generated using 1d12 
+ 1d8. The probability curve ensures that encounters 
appearing in the middle of the table are more likely to 
occur than encounters placed at the beginning or end 
of the table. A roll of 2 or 20 is rare (about a 1 percent 
chance of either), while each of the rolls from 9 to 13 
occurs a little over 8 percent of the time. 
The Sylvan Forest Encounters table is an example 
of a random encounter table that implements the ideas 
mentioned above. Creature names in bold refer to stat 
blocks that appear in the Monster Manual.
