Plenty of people might like to have a magic sword, but 
few of them can afford it. Those who can afford such an 
item usually have more practical things to spend on. See 
chapter 6, "Between Adventures," for one way to handle 
selling magic items. 
In your campaign, magic items might be prevalent 
enough that adventurers can buy and sell them with 
some effort. Magic items might be for sale in bazaars or 
auction houses in fantastical locations, such as the City 
of Brass, the planar metropolis of Sigil, or even in more 
ordinary cities. Sale of magic items might be highly 
regulated, accompanied by a thriving black market. 
Artificers might craft items for use by military forces 
or adventurers, as they do in the world of Eberron. You 
might also allow characters to craft their own magic 
items, as discussed in chapters 6. 
IDENTIFYING A MAGIC ITEM 
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their 
nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items 
display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a 
magic item's appearance, handling the item is enough to 
give a character a sense that something is extraordinary 
about it. Discovering a magic item's properties isn't 
automatic, however. 
The identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an 
item's properties. Alternatively, a character can focus 
on one magic item during a short rest, while being in

physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the 
character learns the item's properties, as well as how 
to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is 
enough to tell the taster what the potion does. 
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its 
properties. The command word to activate a ring mighr 
be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design 
might suggest that it's a ring of feather falling. 
Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer 
hints about its properties. For example, if a character 
puts on a ring of jumping, you could say, "Your steps fee 
strangely springy." Perhaps the character then jumps 
up and down to see what happens. You then say the 
character jumps unexpectedly high. 
VARIANT: MORE DIFFICULT IDENTIFICATION 
If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, 
consider removing the ability to identify the properties 
of a magic item during a short rest, and require the 
identify spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a 
magic item does. 
ATTUNEMENT 
Some magic items require a creature to form a bond 
with them before their magical properties can be used. 
This bond is called attunement, and certain items 
have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, 
a creature must be a member of that class to attune to 
the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster
