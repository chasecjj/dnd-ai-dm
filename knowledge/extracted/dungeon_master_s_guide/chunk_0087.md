In a dead calm (no wind), ships can't move under sail 
and must be rowed. A ship sailing against a strong wind 
moves at half speed. 
ISIBILITY 
A relatively calm sea offers great visibility. From a 
crow's nest, a lookout can spot another ship or a 
oastline up to 10 miles away, assuming clear skies. 
Overcast skies reduce that distance by half. Rain and 
-og reduce visibility just as they do on land. 
OWNING A SHIP 
At some point in your campaign, the adventurers 
might gain custody of a ship. They might purchase or 
capture one or receive one to carry out a mission. It's 
up to you whether a ship is available for purchase, and 
you have the power to deprive the adventurers of a 
hip at any time should it become a nuisance (see the 
-Shipwrecks" sidebar). 
Crew. A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to 
"unction. As per the Player's Handbook, one skilled 
hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum 
number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship 
depends on the type of vessel, as shown in the Airborne 
and Waterborne Vehicles table. 
You can track the loyalty of individual crew members 
or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules 
in chapter 4. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal 
during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a 
mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members 
leave the ship and never return. 
Passengers. The table indicates the number of Small 
and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate. 
Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight 
quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations 
can carry one-fifth as many passengers. 
A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day 
for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A 
mall private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day. 
Cargo. The table indicates the maximum tonnage 
each kind of ship can carry. 
Damage Threshold. A ship has immunity to all 
damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or 
greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes 
damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or 
exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial 
and doesn't reduce the ship's hit points. 
Ship Repair. Repairs to a damaged ship can be made 
. hile the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of 
amage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials 
and labor.

THE SKY 
Flying characters can move from one place to another in 
a relatively straight line, ignoring terrain and monsters 
that can't fly or that lack ranged attacks. 
Flying by spell or magic item works the same as 
travel on foot, as described in the Player's Handbook. A 
creature that serves as a flying mount must rest 1 hour 
for every 3 hours it flies, and it can't fly for more than 
9 hours per day. Thus, characters mounted on griffons 
(which have a flying speed of 80 feet) can travel at 8 
miles per hour, covering 72 miles over 9 hours with two 
1-hour-long rests over the course of the day. Mounts that 
don't tire (such as a flying construct) aren't subject to 
this limitation.
