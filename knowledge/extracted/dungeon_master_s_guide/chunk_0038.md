Traveling through the Deep Ethereal to journey from 
one plane to another is unlike physical travel. Distance 
is meaningless, so although travelers feel as if they can 
move by a simple act of will, it's impossible to measure 
speed and hard to track the passage of time. A trip 
between planes through the Deep Ethereal takes 1d10 
x 10 hours, regardless of the origin and destination. In 
combat, however, creatures are considered to move at 
their normal speeds. 
ETHER CYCLONES 
An ether cyclone is a serpentine column that spins 
through the plane. The cyclone appears abruptly, 
distorting and uprooting ethereal forms in its path and 
carrying the debris for leagues. Travelers with a passive 
Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or more receive 1d4 
rounds of warning: a deep hum in the ethereal matter. 
Travelers who can't reach a curtain or portal leading 
elsewhere suffer the cyclone's effect. Roll a d20 and 
consult the Ether Cyclone table to determine the effect 
on all creatures in the vicinity.

Hurled into the Astral Plane 
The most common effect of an ether cyclone is to 
extend the duration of a journey. Each character in a 
group traveling together must make a DC 15 Charisma 
aving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel 
is delayed by 1d10 hours. Otherwise, the journey's travel 
time is doubled. Less often, a group is blown into the 
Border Ethereal of a random plane. Rarely, the cyclone 
rears a hole in the fabric of the plane and hurls the party 
into the Astral Plane. 
E THEREAL PLANE ENCOUNTERS 
_lost encounters in the Border Ethereal are with 
eatures on the Material Plane whose senses or 
abilities extend into the Ethereal Plane (phase spiders, 
:or example). Ghosts also move freely between the 
:=:rhereal and Material Planes. 
In the Deep Ethereal, most encounters are with other 
~velers , particularly ones from the Inner Planes (such 
...: elementals, genies, and salamanders), as well as the 
- casional celestial, fiend, or fey. 
FEYWILD 
Stepping into the portal was like settling into a warm bath, 
though the chill didn't jade from the air. At first everything 
muted-the roar of the river around the rocks below, the 
chirping of frogs and crickets on shore, the evening bustle of 
the town behind him . ... A moment later, the world erupted 
into vibrant life. Frogs and night birds sang a chorus; the air 
was awash with autumn scents; the moonlight painted the 
flowers in iridescent blue, silver, and violet; and the rushing 
of the river became a complex symphony. 
-James Wyatt, Oath of Vigilance 
The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of 
soft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a 
realm of everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights 
bobbing in the gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing 
through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the 
faded colors of an ever-setting sun, which never truly 
sets (or rises for that matter); it remains stationary, 
dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas 
ruled by the seelie fey that compose the Summer Court, 
the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and 
syrupy fens- perfect territory for the unseelie fey to hunt 
their prey. 
The Feywild exists in parallel to the Material 
Plane, an alternate dimension that occupies the same 
cosmological space. The landscape of the Feywild 
mirrors the natural world but turns its features into 
spectacular forms. Where a volcano stands on the 
Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper-
sized crystals that glow with internal fire towers in the 
Feywild. A wide and muddy river on the Material Plane 
might be echoed as a clear and winding brook of great 
beauty. A marsh could be reflected as a vast black bog of 
sinister character. And moving to the Feywild from old 
ruins on the Material Plane might put a traveler at the 
door of an arch fey's castle. 
The Feywild is inhabited by sylvan creatures, such 
as elves, dryads, satyrs, pixies, and sprites, as well as 
centaurs and magical creatures such as blink dogs, 
faerie dragons, treants, and unicorns. The darker 
regions of the plane are home to such malevolent 
creatures as hags, blights, goblins, ogres, and giants. 
SEELIE AND UNSEELIE FEY 
Two queens hold court in the Feywild, and most fey owe 
allegiance to one or the other. Queen Titania and her 
Summer Court lead the seelie fey, and the Queen of Air and 
Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court, leads the unseelie fey. 
Seelie and unseelie do not directly correlate with good and 
evil, though many mortals make that equation. Many seelie 
fey are good, and many unseelie are evil, but their opposition 
to each other stems from their queens' jealous rivalry, not 
abstract moral concerns. Ugly denizens of the Feywild, such 
as fomorians and hags, are almost never members of either 
court, and fey of independent spirit reject the courts entirely. 
The courts have warred at times, but they also compete in 
more-or-less friendly contests and even ally with one another 
in small and secret ways.
