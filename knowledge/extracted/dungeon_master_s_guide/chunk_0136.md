NINE LIVES STEALER 
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement) 
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. 
The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical 
hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, 
it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or 
be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its 
body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword 
loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword 
has no charges remaining, it loses this property. 
NOLZUR'S MARVELOUS PIGMENTS 
Wondrous item, very rare 
Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box 
with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments 
allow you to create three-dimensional objects by 
painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from 
the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate 
on its image. 
Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square 
feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects 
or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, 
cells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to 10,000 cubic 
feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet. 
When you complete the painting, the object or terrain 
feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. 
Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door 
that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit 
on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against 
the total area of objects you create. 
Nothing created by the pigments can have a value 
greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value 
(such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks 
authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from 
paste, bone, or some other worthless material. 
If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, 
the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you 
complete the painting, doing no harm to anything. 
0ATHBOW 
Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement) 
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in 
Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use 
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a 
command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have 
wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your 
sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. 
You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. 
When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new 
one after the next dawn. 
When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon 
against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the 
roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, 
other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage 
due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy 
takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage. 
While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage 
on attack rolls with all other weapons. 
OIL OF ETHEREALNESS 
Potion, rare 
Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its 
container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a 
Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment 
it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required
