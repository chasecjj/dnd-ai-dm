Hit Points. An object's hir points measure how much 
damage it can take before lo ina i 
srrucrural integrity. 
Resilient objects have more hir pain than fragile ones. 
Large objects also tend to ha\·e more hir points than 
small ones, unless breaking a small part of rhe object is 
just as effective as breaking the whole rhing. The Object 
Hit Points table provides suggested hir points for fragile 
and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.

Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are 
of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, 
such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or 
massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge 
tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus 
to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's 
hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long 
the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is 
acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, 
divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each 
section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those 
sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a 
Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when 
one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points. 
Objects and Damage Types. Objects are immune 
to poison and psychic damage. You might decide 
that some damage types are more effective against a 
particular object or substance than others. For example, 
bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things 
but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or 
cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning 
damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively 
cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment. 
Damage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls 
often have extra resilience represented by a damage 
threshold. An object with a damage threshold has 
immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount 
of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or 
greater than its damage threshold, in which case it 
takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet 
or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered 
superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points. 
COMBAT 
This section builds on the combat rules in the Player's 
Handbook and offers tips for keeping the game running 
smoothly when a fight breaks out. 
TRACKING INITIATIVE 
You can use several different methods for keeping track 
of who goes when in combat. 
HIDDEN LIST 
Many DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players 
can't see: usually a piece of paper behind a DM screen 
or a spreadsheet on a tablet computer. This method 
allows you to keep track of combatants who haven't been 
revealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place 
to record the current hit points of monsters, as well as 
other useful notes. 
A downside of this approach is that you have to remind 
the players round after round when their turns come up. 
VISIBLE LIST 
You can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the 
players tell you their initiative numbers, write them on 
the whiteboard in order from highest to lowest, leaving 
space between each name. Either write the monsters' 
initiatives on the list at the same time or add them to the 
list on each monster's first turn. 
As a further improvement, use magnets that you can 
attach to a metal-based whiteboard with characters' and 
monsters' names written on them, or write those names 
on cards held in place by magnets. 
A visible list lets everyone see the order of play. 
Players know when their turns are coming up, and they 
can start planning their actions in advance. A visible list 
also removes any uncertainty about when the monsters 
will act in the fight. 
A variation on the visible list is to give one player 
responsibility for keeping track of initiative, either on 
a white board or on a piece of paper the other players 
can see. This method reduces the number of things you 
need to keep track of yourself. 
INDEX CARDS 
In this approach, each character gets an index card, as 
does each group of identical monsters. When the players 
tell you their initiative numbers, write the numbers on 
their characters' index cards. Do the same when you roll 
the monsters' initiative. Then arrange the cards in order 
from highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move 
down through the stack. When you call out the name of 
the character whose turn it is, also mention who's next, 
prompting that player to start thinking ahead. After 
each character or group of monsters acts, the top card is 
moved to the bottom of the stack. 
At first, players don't know the order of play when 
you use combat cards, and they don't know where the 
monsters fall into the order until the monsters act. 
TRACKING MONSTER HIT POINTS 
During a combat encounter, you need to track how much 
damage each monster takes. Most DMs track damage 
in secret so that their players don't know how many hit 
points a monster has remaining. Whether you choose to 
be secretive or not is up to you. What's important is that 
every monster's hit points be tracked individually. 
Tracking damage for one or two monsters isn't 
onerous, but it helps to have a system for larger 
groups of monsters. If you aren't using miniatures 
or other visual aids, the easiest way to keep track 
of your monsters is to assign them unique features. 
Descriptions such as "the ogre with the nasty scar" 
and "the ogre with the horned helm" help you and your 
players track which monster is which. For example, 
imagine that you're running an encounter with three
