FEY CROSSINGS 
Fey crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the 
Material Plane that have a near-perfect mirror in the 
Feywild, creating a portal where the two planes touch. 
A traveler passes through a fey crossing by entering a 
clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of 
mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To 
the traveler, it seems like he or she has simply walked 
into the Feywild with a step. To an observer, the traveler 
is there one moment and gone the next. 
Like other portals between planes, most fey crossings 
open infrequently. A crossing might open only during 
a full moon, on the dawn of a particular day, or for 
someone carrying a certain type of item. A fey crossing 
can be closed permanently if the land on either side is 
dramatically altered- for example, if a castle is built 
over the clearing on the Material Plane. 
OPTIONAL RULES: FEYWILD MAGIC 
Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures 
and spirited away to the Feywild, only to return to their 
parents years later without having aged a day, and 
with no memories of their captors or the realm they 
came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an 
excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover 
upon their return that time flows differently on the 
Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit 
are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the 
strange magic that suffuses the plane. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTTVERSE 
MEMORY LOSS 
A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 
10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically 
succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like 
elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that 
fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its 
time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the 
creature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy. 
Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's 
lost memories. 
TIME WARP 
While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, 
characters might spend a day there and realize, upon 
leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed 
everywhere else in the multiverse. 
Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves 
the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, 
you can choose a time change that works best for your 
campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp 
table. A wish spell can be used to remove the effect on 
up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey have the ability 
to grant such wishes and might do so if the beneficiaries 
agree to subject themselves to a geas spell and complete 
a quest after the wish spell is cast.

S HADOWFELL 
• iven stood in the uppermost room of the central tower of 
·is citadel-a fortress of shadows and dark stone carved in 
-elief into the sheer face of a jagged peak . ... The starless 
·tack vault of the plane's sky hung over a landscape of gray 
nd black, where lived the dark simulacra of actual things. 
hadows and wraiths and specters and ghosts and other 
!.mdead hung in the air around the citadel, or prowled

everything he could see.jelt it as an extension of himself, 
and the feeling made him too big by half. 
-PaulS. Kemp, The Godborn 
he Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a 
dimension of black, gray, and white where most other 
color has been leached from everything. It is a place of 
darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black 
ault with neither sun nor stars. 
The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane in much 
r.be same way as the Feywild. Aside from the colorless 
landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane. 
Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable 
on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped-
distorted reflections of what exists on the Material 
Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane, 
the corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged 
rock outcropping with a resemblance to a skull, a heap 
of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great 
castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted, 
its branches reaching out to snare travelers' cloaks, and 
its roots coiling and buckling to trip those who pass by. 
Shadow dragons and undead creatures haunt this 
bleak plane, as do other creatures that thrive in the 
gloom, including cloakers and darkmantles. 
SHADOW CROSSINGS 
Similar to fey crossings, shadow crossings are locations 
where the veil between the Material Plane and the 
Shadowfell is so thin that creatures can walk from one 
plane to the other. A blot of shadow in the corner of a 
dusty crypt might be a shadow crossing, as might an 
open grave. Shadow crossings form in gloomy places 
where spirits or the stench of death lingers, such as 
battlefields, graveyards, and tombs. They manifest only 
in darkness, closing as soon as they feel light's kiss. 
DOMAINS OF DREAD 
In remote corners of the Shadowfell, it is easy to reach 
horrific demiplanes ruled over by accursed beings of 
terrible evil. The best known of these is the valley of 
Barovia, overlooked by the towering spires of Castle 
Ravenloft and ruled by Count Strahd von Zarovich, 
the first vampire. Beings of the Shadowfell called the 
Dark Powers created these domains as prisons for
