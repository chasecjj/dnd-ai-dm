PLAY STYLE 
By building a new world (or adopting an existing one) 
and creating the key events that launch your campaign, 
you determined what your campaign is about. Next, you 
have to decide how you want to run your campaign. 
What's the right way to run a campaign? That depends 
on your play style and the motivations of your players. 
Consider your players' tastes, your strengths as a 
DM, table rules (discussed in part 3), and the type of 
game you want to run. Describe to the players how you 
envision the game experience and let them give you 
input. The game is theirs, too. Lay that groundwork 
early, so your players can make informed choices and 
help you maintain the type of game you want to run. 
Consider the following two exaggerated examples of 
play style. 
HACK AND SLASH 
The adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the 
monsters, and grab the treasure. This style of play is 
straightforward, fun, exciting, and action-oriented. The 
players spend relatively little time developing personas 
for their characters, roleplaying noncombat situations, 
or discussing anything other than the immediate 
dangers of the dungeon. 
In such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil 
monsters and opponents and occasionally meet clearly 
good and helpful NPCs. Don't expect the adventurers 
to anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to debate 
whether it's right or wrong to invade and wipe out a 
bugbear lair. Don't track money or time spent in town. 
Once they've completed a task, send the adventurers 
back into the action as quickly as possible. Character 
motivation need be no more developed than a desire to 
kill monsters and acquire treasure. 
lMMERSIVE STORYTELLING 
Waterdeep is threatened by political turmoil. The 
adventurers must convince the Masked Lords, the city's 
secret rulers, to resolve their differences, but can do so 
A WORLD TO EXPLORE 
Much of a campaign involves the adventurers traveling from 
place to place, exploring the environment, and learning 
about the fantasy world. This exploration can take place in 
any environment, including a vast wilderness, a labyrinthine 
dungeon, the shadowy passages of the Underdark, the 
crowded streets of a city, and the undulating waters of 
the sea. Determining a way around an obstacle, finding a 
hidden object, investigating a strange feature of a dungeon, 
deciphering clues, solving puzzles, and bypassing or 
disabling traps can all be part of exploration. 
Sometimes exploration is an incidental part of the game. 
For instance, you might gloss over an unimportant journey 
by telling the players that they spend three uneventful days 
on the road before moving along to the next point of interest. 
Other times exploration is the focus, a chance to describe 
a wondrous part of the world or story that increases the 
players' feeling of immersion. Similarly, you should consider 
playing up exploration if your players enjoy solving puzzles, 
finding their way around obstacles, and searching dungeon 
corridors for secret doors. 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
,. 
only after both the characters and the lords have come 
to terms with their differing outlooks and agendas. 
This style of gaming is deep, complex, and challenging. 
The focus isn't on combat but on negotiations, political 
maneuverings, and character interaction. A whole game 
session might pass without a single attack roll. 
In this style of game, the NPCs are as complex and 
richly detailed as the adventurers, although the focus 
lies on motivation and personality, not game statistics. 
Expect long digressions from each player about what 
his or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to 
ask a priest for advice can be as important an encounter 
as fighting orcs. (And don't expect the adventurers to 
fight the orcs at all unless they are motivated to do 
so.) A character will sometimes take actions against 
the player's better judgment, because "that's what the 
character would do." 
Since combat isn't the focus, game rules take a back 
seat to character development. Ability check modifiers 
and skill proficiencies take precedence over combat 
bonuses. Feel free to change or ignore rules to fit the 
players' roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in 
part 3 of this book. 
SOMETHING IN BETWEEN 
The style of play in most campaigns falls between these 
two extremes. There's plenty of action, but the campaign 
offers an ongoing storyline and interaction between 
characters as well. Players develop their characters' 
motivations and relish the chance to prove their skills 
in combat. To maintain the balance, provide a mixture 
of roleplaying encounters and combat encounters. Even 
in a dungeon setting, you can present NPCs that aren't 
meant to be fought but rather helped out, negotiated 
with, or just talked to. 
Think about your preferred style of play by 
considering these questions: 
• Are you a fan of realism and gritty consequences, or 
are you more focused on making the game seem like 
an action movie? 
• Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval 
fantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines 
or modern thinking? 
Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor 
your goal? 
• Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted 
or intense? 
• Is bold action key, or do the players need to be 
thoughtful and cautious? 
Do you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you 
prefer improvising on the spot? 
• Is the game full of varied D&D elements, or does it 
center on a theme such as horror? 
• Is the game for all ages, or does it involve 
mature themes? 
Are you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as 
allowing the characters to explore whether the end 
justifies the means? Or are you happier with straight-
forward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice, 
and helping the downtrodden?
