HEALING SPELLS 
You can also use the Spell Damage table to determine 
how many hit points a healing spell restores. A cantrip 
shouldn't offer healing. 
CREATING A MAGIC ITEM 
The magic items in chapter 7, "Treasure," are but a few 
of the magic treasures that characters can discover 
during their adventures. If your players are seasoned 
veterans and you want to surprise them, you can either 
modify an existing item or come up with something new. 
MODIFYING AN ITEM 
The easiest way to invent a new item is to tweak an 
existing one. If a paladin uses a flail as her main 
weapon, you could change a holy avenger so that it's a 
flail instead of a sword. You can turn a ring of the ram 
into a wand, or a cloak of protection into a circlet of 
protection, all without altering the item's properties. 
Other substitutions are equally easy. An item that 
deals damage of one type can easily deal damage of 
another type. A flame tongue sword could deal lightning 
damage instead of fire, for example. One capability 
can replace another, so a potion of climbing can easily 
become a potion of stealth. 
You can also modify an item by fusing it with 
properties from another item. For example, you could 
combine the effects of a helm of comprehending 
languages with those of a helm of telepathy into a 
single helmet. This makes the item more powerful 
(and probably increases its rarity), but it won't break 
your game. 
Finally, remember the tools that are provided for 
modifying items in chapter 7, "Treasure." Giving an item 
an interesting minor property, a quirk, or sentience can 
alter its flavor significantly. 
CREATING A NEW ITEM 
If modifying an item doesn't quite do the trick, you can 
create one from scratch. A magic item should either let a 
character do something he or she couldn't do before, or 
improve the character's ability to do something he or she 
can do already. For example, the ring of jumping lets its 
wearer jump greater distances, thus augmenting what 
a character can already do. A ring of the ram, however, 
gives a character the ability to deal force damage.

The simpler your approach. the easier it is for a 
character to use the item in play. Giving the item 
charges is fine, especially if it ha several different 
abilities, but simply deciding that an item is always 
active or can be used a fixed number of times per day is 
easier to rna nage. 
POWER LEVEL 
If you make an item that lets a character kill whatever 
he or she hits with it, that item will likely unbalance your 
game. On the other hand, an item whose benefit rarely 
comes into play isn't much of a reward and probably not 
worth doling out as one. 
Use the Magic Item Power by Rarity table as a guide 
to help you determine how powerful an item should be, 
based on its rarity.

Maximum Spell Level. This column of the table 
indicates the highest-level spell effect the item should 
confer, in the form of a once-per-day or similarly limited 
property. For example, a common item might confer 
the benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once, 
if it's consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item 
might allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell 
more frequently. 
Maximum Bonus. If an item delivers a static bonus 
to AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, this 
column suggests an appropriate bonus based on the 
item's rarity. 
ATTUNEMENT 
Decide whether the item requires a character to be 
attuned to it to use its properties. Use these rules of 
thumb to help you decide: 
If having all the characters in a party pass an item 
around to gain its lasting benefits would be disruptive, 
the item should require attunement. 
If the item grants a bonus that other items also 
grant, it's a good idea to require attunement so that 
characters don't try to collect too many of those items. 
CREATING NEW 
CHARACTER OPTIONS 
If the options for player characters in the Player's 
Handbook don't meet all the needs of your campaign, 
consult the following sections for advice on creating 
new race, class, and background options. 
CREATING A RACE OR SUBRACE ----
This section teaches you how to modify existing races, 
as well as create new ones. The most important step in 
customizing or designing races for your campaign is 
to start with the story behind the race or subrace you 
wish to create. Having a firm idea of a race's story in 
your campaign will help you make decisions during the 
creation process. Ask yourself several questions: 
Why does my campaign need the race to be playable? 
What does the race look like? 
How would I describe the race's culture? 
Where do the members of this race live? 
Are there interesting conflicts built into the race's 
history and culture that make the race compelling 
from a storytelling standpoint? 
• What is the race's relationship to the other 
playable races? 
• What classes and backgrounds are well suited to 
members of the race? 
What are the race's signature traits? 
• In the case of a new subrace, what sets it apart from 
the other subraces of the parent race? 
Compare the race you have in mind with the other 
race options available to players, to make sure that the 
new race doesn't pale in comparison to the existing 
options (which would result in the race being unpopular) 
or completely overshadow them (so that players don't 
feel as if the other options are inferior). 
When the time comes to design the game elements 
of the race, such as its traits, take a look at the game's 
existing races and let them inspire you. 
CosMETIC ALTERATIONS 
A simple way to modify an existing race is to change 
its appearance. Changes to a race's appearance need 
not affect its game elements. For example, you could 
transform halflings into anthropomorphic mice without 
changing their racial traits at all. 
CULTURAL ALTERATIONS 
In your world, elves might be desert nomads instead of 
forest dwellers, halflings might live in cloud cities, and 
dwarves might be sailors instead of miners. When you 
change the culture of a race, you can also make minor 
alterations to the race's proficiencies and traits to reflect 
that culture. 
For example, imagine that the dwarves of your world 
are seafarers and inventors of gunpowder. You could 
add the pistol and musket to the list of weapons that 
dwarves are proficient with, and give them proficiency 
with waterborne vehicles instead of artisan's tools. 
These two small changes tell a different story than 
the default assumptions about dwarves in the Player's 
Handbook, without changing the power level of the race. 
CREATING A NEW SUBRACE 
Creating a new subrace is more involved than making 
some minor tweaks to existing racial features, but it 
does have the advantage of increasing the diversity of 
options for a particular race, rather than replacing some 
options with other ones. 
The following example walks through the creation of 
an elf subrace: the eladrin. This subrace has history in 
the D&D multi verse, so you already have some stories to 
draw on when building its traits.
