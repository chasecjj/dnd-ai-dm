witnesses, hit by stray arrow fire, or mistaken for 
members of one group and attacked by the other. 
Bullies. The characters witness ld4 + 2 bullies 
harassing an out-of-towner (use the commoner statistics 
in the Monster Manual for all of them). A bully flees as 
soon as he or she takes any amount of damage. 
Companion. One or more characters are approached 
by a local who takes a friendly interest in the party's 
activities. As a twist, the would-be companion might be 
a spy sent to gather information on the adventurers. 
Contest. The adventurers are drawn into an 
impromptu contest-anything from an intellectual test 
to a drinking competition-or witness a duel. 
Corpse. The adventurers find a humanoid corpse. 
Draft. The characters are drafted by a member of the 
city or town watch, who needs their help to deal with an 
immediate problem. As a twist, the member of the watch 
might be a disguised criminal trying to lure the party 
into an ambush (use the thug statistics in the Monster 
Manual for the criminal and his or her cohorts). 
Drunk. A tipsy drunk staggers toward a random party 
member, mistaking him or her for someone else. 
Fire. A fire breaks out, and the characters have a 
chance to help put out the flames before it spreads. 
Found Trinket. The characters find a random trinket. 
You can determine the trinket by rolling on the Trinkets 
table in the Player's Handbook. 
Guard Harassment. The adventurers are cornered 
by ld4 + 1 guards eager to throw their weight around. If 
threatened, the guards call out for help and might attract 
the attention of other guards or citizens nearby. 
Pickpocket. A thief (use the spy statistics in the 
Monster Manual) tries to steal from a random character. 
Characters whose passive Wisdom (Perception) scores 
are equal to or greater than the thief's Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand) check total catch the theft in progress. 
Procession. The adventurers encounter a group of 
citizens either parading in celebration or forming a 
funeral procession. 
Protest. The adventurers see a group of citizens 
peacefully protesting a new law or decree. A handful of 
guards maintain order. 
Runaway Cart. A team of horses pulling a wagon 
races through the city streets. The adventurers must 
avoid the horses. If they stop the wagon, the owner (who 
is running behind the cart) is grateful. 
Shady Transaction. The characters witness a shady 
transaction between two cloaked figures. 
Spectacle. The characters witness a form of public 
entertainment, such as a talented bard's impersonation 
of a royal personage, a street circus, a puppet show, 
a flashy magic act, a royal visit, or a public execution. 
Urchin. A street urchin gloms onto the adventurers 
and follows them around until frightened off. 
UNUSUAL ENVIRONMENTS 
Traveling through the wilderness doesn't always mean 
an overland trek. Adventurers might ply the open sea in 
a caravel or an elemental-powered galleon, soar through 
the air on hippogriffs or a carpet of flying, or ride giant 
sea horses to coral palaces deep beneath the sea.

S ee chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook for rules on 
underwater combat. 
RANDOM UNDERSEA ENCOUNTERS 
You can check for random undersea encounters as often 
as you would check for them on land (see chapter 3). The 
Random Undersea Encounters table presents several 
intriguing options. You can either roll on the table for a 
random result or choose whichever one works best.

SwiMMING 
Unless aided by magic, a character can't swim for a 
full 8 hours per day. After each hour of swimming, a 
character must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw or gain one level of exhaustion. 
A creature that has a swimming speed-including a 
character with a ring of swimming or similar magic-
can swim all day without penalty and uses the normal 
forced march rules in the Player's Handbook. 
Swimming through deep water is similar to traveling 
at high altitudes, because of the water's pressure and 
cold temperature. For a creature without a swimming 
speed, each hour spent swimming at a depth greater 
than 100 feet counts as 2 hours for the purpose of
