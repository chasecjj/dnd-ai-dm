CHAPTER 8: RUNNING THE GAME 
ULES ENABLE YOU AND YOUR PLAYERS TO HAVE 
fun at the table. The rules serve you, not vice 
versa. There are the rules of the game, and 
there are table rules for how the game is 
played. For instance, players need to know 
what happens when one of them misses a 
session. They need to know whether to bring 
miniatures, any special rules you've decided to use, and 
how to treat a cocked die (a die that lands so that its 
face can't be clearly read). These topics and more are 
covered in this chapter. 
TABLE RULES 
Ideally, players come to the gaming table with the same 
goal: to have a fun time together. This section gives 
recommendations for table rules you can establish to 
help meet that goal. Here are some fundamentals: 
Foster respect. Don't bring personal conflicts to the 
table or let disagreements escalate into bad feelings. 
Don't touch others' dice if they're sensitive about it. 
Avoid distractions. Turn off the television and video 
games. If you have young children, hire a babysitter. 
Reducing distractions helps players stay in character 
and enjoy the story. It might be fine to have players 
wandering away from the table and back, but some 
players prefer planned breaks. 
Have snacks. Decide before a session who will bring 
food and drink. This is often something the players 
can handle. 
TABLE TALK 
Set expectations about how players talk at the table: 
Make it clear who's speaking: the character or the 
player (out of character). 
Decide how you feel about a player sharing 
information that his or her character wouldn't know or 
that the character is incapable of sharing as a result of 
being unconscious, dead, or far away. 
Are you all right with players retracting what they just 
said their characters did? 
DICE ROLLING 
Establish expectations about rolling dice. Rolling in full 
view of everyone is a good starting point. If you see a 
player rolling and scooping the dice up before anyone 
else can see, encourage that player to be less secretive. 
When a die falls on the floor, do you count it or reroll 
it? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the 
book away and see where it lands, or re~;oll it? 
What about you, the DM? Do you make your rolls in 
the open or hide them behind a DM screen? Consider 
the following: 
If you roll dice where the players can see, they know 
you're playing impartially and not fudging rolls. 
Rolling behind a screen keeps the players guessing 
about the strength of their opposition. When a 
monster hits all the time, is it of a much higher level 
than the characters, or are you rolling high numbers? 
Rolling behind a screen lets you fudge the results if 
you want to. If two critical hits in a row would kill a 
character, you could change the second critical hit 
into a normal hit, or even a miss. Don't distort die rolls 
too often, though, and don't let on that you're doing it. 
Otherwise, your players might think they don't face 
any real risks-or worse, that you're playing favorites. 
A roll behind a screen can help preserve mystery. For 
example, if a player thinks there might be someone 
invisible nearby and makes a Wisdom (Perception) 
check, consider rolling a die behind the screen even if 
no one is there, making the player think someone is, 
indeed, hiding. Try not to overuse this trick. 
You might choose to make a roll for a player because 
you don't want the player to know how good the check 
total is. For example, if a player suspects a baroness 
might be charmed and wants to make a Wisdom 
(Insight) check, you could make the roll in secret for 
the player. If the player rolled and got a high number 
but didn't sense anything amiss, the player would be 
confident that the baroness wasn't charmed. With a 
low roll, a negative answer wouldn't mean much. A 
hidden roll allows uncertainty. 
ROLLING ATTACKS AND DAMAGE 
Players are accustomed to rolling an attack roll first 
and then a damage roll. If players make attack rolls and 
damage rolls at the same time, the action moves a little 
faster around the table. 
RULES DISCUSSIONS 
You might need to set a policy on rules discussions at 
the table. Some groups don't mind putting the game 
on hold while they hash out different interpretations 
of a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and 
continue with the action. If you gloss over a rules issue 
in play, make a note of it (a good task to delegate to a 
player) and return to the issue later. 
METAGAME THINKING 
Metagame thinking means thinking about the game as 
a game. It's like when a character in a movie knows it's a 
movie and acts accordingly. For example, a player might 
say, "The DM wouldn't throw such a powerful monster 
at us!" or you might hear, "The read-aloud text spent a 
lot of time describing that door- let's search it again!" 
Discourage metagame thinking by giving players a 
gentle reminder: "What do your characters think?" You 
can curb metagame thinking by setting up situations 
that will be difficult for the characters and that might 
require negotiation or retreat to survive. 
MISSING PLAYERS 
How should you deal with the characters of missing 
players? Consider these options:
