COMBAT ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
There are four categories of encounter difficulty. 
Easy. An easy encounter doesn't tax the characters' 
resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose 
a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed. 
Medium. A medium encounter usually has one or 
two scary moments for the players, but the characters 
should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or 
more of them might need to use healing resources. 
Hard. A hard encounter could go badly for the 
adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out 
of the fight, and there's a slim chance that one or more 
characters might die. 
Deadly. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or 
more player characters. Survival often requires good 
tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.

CHALLENGE RATING 
When putting together an encounter or adventure, especially 
at lower levels, exercise caution when using monsters whose 
challenge rating is higher than the party's average level. Such 
a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to 
take out adventurers of a lower level. For example, an ogre 
has a challenge rating of 2, but it can kill a l st-level wizard 
with a single blow. 
In addition, some monsters have features that might be 
difficult or impossible for lower-level characters to overcome. 
For example, a rakshasa has a challenge rating of 13 and is 
immune to spells of 6th level and lower. Spellcasters of 12th 
level or lower have no spells higher than 6th level, mean ing 
that they won't be able to affect the rakshasa with their 
magic, putting the adventurers at a serious disadvantage. 
Such an encounter would be significantly tougher for the 
party than the monster's challenge rating might suggest. 
CHAPTER 3 I C REATI NG ADVENTURES 
EVALUATING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any 
combat encounter. 
1. Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the 
experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in 
the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table 
below has four XP thresholds for each character level, 
one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a 
character's level to determine his or her XP thresholds. 
Repeat this process for every character in the party. 
2. Determine the Party's XP Threshold. For each 
category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters' 
XP thresholds. This determines the party's XP 
threshold. You'll end up with four totals, one for each 
category of encounter difficulty. 
For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level 
characters and one 2nd-level character, the party's 
totaled XP thresholds would be as follows: 
Easy: 275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50) 
Medium: 550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + l 00) 
Hard: 825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150) 
Deadly: l ,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200) 
Record the totals, because you can use them for every 
encounter in your adventure. 
3. Total the Monsters' XP. Add up the XP for all of 
the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP 
value in its stat block. 
4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the 
encounter includes more than one monster, apply 
a multiplier to the monsters' total XP. The more 
monsters there are, the more attack rolls you're making 
against the characters in a given round, and the more 
dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge 
an encounter's difficulty, multiply the total XP of all 
the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the 
Encounter Multipliers table. 
For example, if an encounter includes four monsters 
worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP 
of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. 
This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth 
in terms of XP; the adjusted value's only purpose is to 
help you accurately assess the encounter's difficulty. 
When making this calculation, don't count any 
monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below 
the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the 
group unless you think the weak monsters significantly 
contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.

5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters' adjusted XP 
value to the party's XP thresholds. The closest threshold 
that is lower than the adjusted XP value of the monsters 
determines the encounter's difficulty.
