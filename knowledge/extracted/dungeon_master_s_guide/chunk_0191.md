ogres, each of which has 59 hit points. Once initiative 
is rolled, jot down each ogre's hit points and add notes 
(and even a name, if you like) to differentiate each one: 
Krag (ogre wf scar): 59 
Thod (ogre wf helm): 59 
Mur (ogre who smells like poo): 59 
If you use miniatures to represent monsters, one 
easy way to differentiate them is to give each one a 
unique miniature. If you use identical miniatures to 
represent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures 
with small stickers of different colors or stickers with 
different letters or numbers on them. 
For example, in a combat encounter with three ogres, 
you could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged 
with stickers marked A, B, and C, respectively. To track 
the ogres' hit points, you can sort them by letter, then 
subtract damage from their hit points as they take it. 
Your records might look something like this after a few 
rounds of combat: 
Ogre A: 59~ 45 ~ 
t4 9 dead 
Ogre B: 59 5t 30 
Ogre C: 59 
Players often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don't ever 
feel as though you need to reveal exact hit points, but if 
a monster is below half its hit point maximum, it's fair to 
say that it has visible wounds and appears beaten down. 
You can describe a monster taken to half its hit points as 
bloodied, giving the players a sense of progress in a fight 
against a tough opponent, and helping them judge when 
to use their most powerful spells and abilities.

USING AND TRACKING CONDITIONS 
Various rules and features in the game are clear abour 
when they apply a condition to a creature. You can also 
apply conditions on the fly. They're meant to be intuitiYe 
for you to do so. For example, if a character is in a state 
such as sleep, that lacks consciousness, you can say 
the character is unconscious. Or did a character just 
stumble onto the ground? He or she is now prone. 
Keeping track of conditions can become tricky. 
For monsters, it's often easiest to track conditions on 
combat cards or wherever you track initiative. Players 
should remember any conditions affecting their 
characters. Because players have incentive to forget or 
overlook hampering conditions, character conditions 
can also be marked on combat cards or a whiteboard. 
You might also try keeping a supply of index cards on 
hand, marked with conditions and their effects. Then 
hand the cards to players as the conditions come up. 
Having a bright pink index card on top of a character 
sheet can help even the most absentminded player 
remember the effects of being charmed or frightened. 
MONSTERS AND CRITICAL HITS 
A monster follows the same rule for critical hits as 
a player, character. That said, if you use a monster's 
average damage, rather than rolling, you might wonder 
how to handle a critical hit. When the monster scores 
a critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with 
the hit and add them to the average damage. For 
example, if a goblin normally deals 5 (ld6 + 2) slashing 
damage on a hit and scores a critical hit, it deals 5 + l d6 
slashing damage.
