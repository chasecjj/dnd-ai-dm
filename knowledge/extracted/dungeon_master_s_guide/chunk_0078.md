CATACOMBS 
D OORS 
Dungeon doorways might be set within plain arches 
and lintels. They might be festooned with carvings of 
gargoyles or leering faces or engraved with sigils that 
reveal clues as to what lies beyond. 
Stuck Doors. Dungeon doors often become stuck 
when not used frequently. Opening a stuck door requires 
a successful Strength check. Chapter 8, "Running the 
Game," provides guidelines for setting the DC. 
Locked Doors. Characters who don't have the key 
ro a locked door can pick the lock with a successful 
Dexterity check (doing so requires thieves' tools and 
proficiency in their use). They can also force the door 
with a successful Strength check, smash the door to 
pieces by dealing enough damage to it, or use a knock 
spell or similar magic. Chapter 8 provides guidelines 
• 
for setting the DCs and assigning statistics to doors and 
other objects. 
Barred Doors. A barred door is similar to a locked 
door, except that there's no lock to pick, and the door 
can be opened normally from the barred side by using 
an action to lift the bar from its braces. 
SECRET DOORS 
A secret door is crafted to blend into the wall that 
surrounds it. Sometimes faint cracks in the wall or scuff 
marks on the floor betray the secret door's presence. 
Detecting a Secret Door. Use the characters' 
passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to determine 
whether anyone in the party notices a secret door 
without actively searching for it. Characters can also 
find a secret door by actively searching the location 
where the door is hidden and succeeding on a Wisdom

(Perception) check. To set an appropriate DC for the 
check, see chapter 8. 
Opening a Secret Door. Once a secret door is 
detected, a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check 
might be required to determine how to open it if the 
opening mechanism isn't obvious. Set the DC according 
to the difficulty guidelines in chapter 8. 
If adventurers can't determine how to open a secret 
door, breaking it down is always an option. Treat it 
as a locked door made of the same material as the 
surrounding wall, and use the guidelines in chapter 8 to 
determine appropriate DCs or statistics. 
CoNCEALED DooRs 
A concealed door is a normal door that is hidden from 
view. A secret door is carefully crafted to blend into its 
surrounding surface, whereas a concealed door is most 
often hidden by mundane means. It might be covered 
by a tapestry, covered with plaster, or (in the case of 
a concealed trapdoor) hidden under a rug. Normally, 
no ability check is required to find a concealed door. A 
character need only look in the right place or take the 
right steps to reveal the door. However, you can use 
the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to

determin·e whether any of them notices tracks or signs 
of a tapestry or rug having been recently disturbed. 
PORTCULLISES 
A portcullis is a set of vertical bars made of wood or 
iron, reinforced with one or more horizontal bands. It 
blocks a passage or archway until it is raised up into 
the ceiling by a winch and chain. The main benefit of a 
portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing 
guards to watch the area beyond and make ranged 
attacks or cast spells through it. 
Winching a portcullis up or down requires an action. 
If a character can't reach the winch (usually because it is 
on the other side of the portcullis), lifting the portcullis 
or bending its bars far enough apart to pass through 
them requires a successful Strength check. The DC 
of the check depends on the size and weight of the 
portcullis or the thickness of its bars. To determine an 
appropriate DC, see chapter 8. 
DARKNESS AND LIGHT 
Darkness is the default condition inside an underground 
complex or in the interior of aboveground ruins, but an 
inhabited dungeon might have light sources.
