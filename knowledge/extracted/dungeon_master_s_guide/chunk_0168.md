creator and the statistics of an empyrean (see the 
Monster Manual). Once it obtains the artifact, the 
avatar vanishes. 
DESTROYING ARTIFACTS 
An artifact must be destroyed in some special way. 
Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. 
Each artifact has a weakness by which its creation 
can be undone. Learning this weakness might require 
extensive research or the successful completion of a 
quest. The DM decides how a particular artifact can be 
destroyed. Some suggestions are provided here: 
The artifact must be melted down in the volcano, 
forge, or crucible in which it was created. 
The artifact must be dropped into the River Styx. 
The artifact must be swallowed and digested by the 
tarrasque or some other ancient creature. 
The artifact must be bathed in the blood of a god 
or an angel. 
The artifact must be struck and shattered by a special 
weapon crafted for that purpose. 
The artifact must be pulverized between the titanic 
gears of Mechanus. 
The artifact must be returned to its creator, who can 
destroy it by touch. 
SAMPLE ARTIFACTS 
The artifacts presented here have appeared in one or 
more of D&D worlds. Use them as guides when creating 
your own artifacts, or modify them as you see fit. 
AxE OF T H E D WARVISH LORDS 
Weapon (battleaxe), artifact (requires attunement) 
eeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince 
came to believe that his people needed something to 
unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that 
would be such a symbol. 
Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than 
any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to 
the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of 
:\1oradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted 
four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, 
the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With 
them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. 
Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the 
dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges 
and answered slights. The clans became allies, and 
they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era 
of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as 
the First King. When he became old, he passed the 
weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his 
heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many 
generations. 
Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and 
wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war 
fomented by greed for its power and the status it 
bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for 
the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of 
chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. 
Magic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is 
a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a 
belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of 
sharpness. 
Random Properties. The axe has the following 
randomly determined properties: 
2 minor beneficial properties 
1 major beneficial property 
• 2 minor detrimental properties
