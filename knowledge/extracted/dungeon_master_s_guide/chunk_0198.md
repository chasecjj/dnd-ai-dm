Gargantuan object 
Armor Class: 15

A siege tower is a mobile wooden structure with a beam 
frame and slats in its walls. Large wooden wheels or 
rollers allow the tower to be pushed or pulled by soldie "' 
or beasts of burden. Medium or smaller creatures can 
use the siege tower to reach the top of walls up to 40 
feet high. A creature in the tower has total cover from 
attacks outside the tower. 
TREBUCHET 
Huge object 
Armor Class: 15 
Hit Points: 150 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 
A trebuchet is a powerful catapult that throws its 
payload in a high arc, so it can hit targets behind cover. 
Before the trebuchet can be fired, it must be loaded and 
aimed. It takes two actions to load the weapon, two 
actions to aim it, and one action to fire it. 
A trebuchet typically hurls a heavy stone. However, it 
can launch other kinds of projectiles, such as barrels of 
oil or sewage, with different effects. 
Trebuchet Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit. 
range 300/1,200 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it. 
one target. Hit: 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage. 
DISEASES 
A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers 
on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from 
an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon 
finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock 
offends some dark power and contracts a strange 
affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells. 
A simple outbreak might amount to little more than 
a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting 
of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can 
form the basis of one or more adventures as characters 
search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and 
deal with the consequences. 
A disease that does more than infect a few party 
members is primarily a plot device. The rules help 
describe the effects of the disease and how it can be 
cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't 
bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect 
any creature, and a given illness might or might not 
pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A 
plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep 
through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races 
untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell. 
SAMPLE DISEASES 
The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease 
can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving 
throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other 
characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.

~ACKLE FEVER 
-:-his disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are 
:;rrangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, 
·ctims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, 
giving the disease its common name and its morbid 
::Uckname: "the shrieks." 
Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and 
mclude fever and disorientation. The infected creature 
gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until 
Lhe disease is cured. 
Any event that causes the infected creature great 
-rress- including entering combat, taking damage, 
experiencing fear, or having a nightmare- forces the 
creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. 
Dn a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic 
damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter 
or 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw 
ar the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter 
and the incapacitated condition on a success. 
Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 
ieet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter 
must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or 
also become infected with the disease. Once a creature 
ucceeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter 
of that particular infected creature for 24 hours. 
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature 
can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a 
uccessful save, the DC for this save and for the save to 
avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the 
aving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from 
rhe disease. A creature that fails three of these saving 
rhrows gains a randomly determined form of indefinite 
madness, as described later in this chapter. 
S EWER PLAGUE 
Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category 
of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, 
and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes 
transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such 
as rats and otyughs. 
When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that 
carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with 
fi lth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature 
must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or 
become infected. 
It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to 
manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include 
fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one 
level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal 
number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit 
points from finishing a long rest. 
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature 
must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. 
On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level 
decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw 
reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 
1, the creature recovers from the disease. 
SIGHT RoT 
This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and 
eventually blinds the victim. 
A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by 
sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw or become infected. One day after infection, the 
creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature 
takes a - 1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks 
that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the 
symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When 
it reaches - 5, the victim is blinded until its sight is 
restored by magic such as Jesser restoration or heal. 
Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called 
Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, 
a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit 
can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied 
to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents 
the disease from worsening after that rest. After three 
doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely. 
PorsoNs 
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are 
illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among 
assassins, draw, and other evil creatures. 
Poisons come in the following four types. 
Contact. A creature that touches contact poison with 
exposed skin suffers its effects. 
Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of 
ingested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide 
that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing 
advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half 
damage on a failed save. 
Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that 
take effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills a 
5-foot cube. 
Injury. A creature that takes slashing or piercing 
damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated 
with injury poison is exposed to its effects.
