The cult's ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its 
foundation myth. Neophytes retrace the god's footsteps 
in order to share the god's ultimate fate. In the case of 
dying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate 
represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth 
into a transformed existence. Initiates are born into 
a new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs 
but feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is 
promised a place in the god's realm after death, but also 
experiences new meaning in life. 
MONOTHEISM 
Monotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in 
some cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you 
introduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign, 
you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if 
they don't, other religions can exist side by side with 
the monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics 
with spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered 
by the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren't deities 
(possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials, fey, 
fiends, or elementals), or simply by their faith. 
The deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive 
portfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in 
control of everything, and concerned with every aspect 
of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers 
and sacrifices to the same god regardless of what 
aspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether 
marching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping 
to win someone's affections, the worshiper prays to 
the same god. 
Some monotheistic religions describe different 
aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different 
aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics 
of that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining 
their domain access and possibly even their alignment 
on that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer 
aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while 
one who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life 
or Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions, 
clerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to 
differentiate clerics who choose different domains. 
DUALISM 
A dualistic religion views the world as the stage for 
a conflict between two diametrically opposed deities 
or divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are 
good and evil, or opposed deities representing those 
forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law 
and chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic 
system. Life and death, light and darkness, rna ter and 
spirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and 
defilement, positive energy and negative energy-the 
D&D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve 
as the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the 
terms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair 
is usually believed to be good- beneficial, desirable, 
or holy-while the other half is considered bad, if not 
explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is 
expressed as the opposition between matter and spirit, 
the followers of that religion believe that one of the two 
(usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and

so seek to liberate their spirits from this material world 
and its evils through asceticism and contemplation. 
Rare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing 
forces must remain in balance, always pulling away 
from each other but remaining bound together in 
creative tension. 
In a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between 
good and evil, mortals are expected to take sides. The 
majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship 
the deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of 
the good deity trust themselves to that god's power to 
protect them from the evil deity's minions. Because 
the evil deity in such a religion is usually the source 
of everything that is detrimental to existence, only the 
perverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters 
and fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The 
myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the 
good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the 
forces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn't 
predetermined and work to promote their deity's victory. 
Deities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios. 
All aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle, 
and therefore all things can fall on one side or the other 
of the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine, 
and poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and 
famine, hatred, disease, and war belong to the evil deity. 
ANIMISM 
Animism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of 
the natural world. In an animistic worldview, everything 
has a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest 
rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the 
sun and moon to a fighter's ancestral sword. All these 
objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, 
though some are more aware, alert, and intelligent 
than others. The most powerful spirits might even 
be considered deities. All are worthy of respect if not 
veneration. 
Animists don't typically pay allegiance to one spirit 
over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices 
to different spirits at different times, as appropriate 
to the situation. A pious character might make daily 
prayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits 
of the house, regular petitions to important spirits 
such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional 
sacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the 
spirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other 
spirits as well. 
An animistic religion very tolerant. Most spirits don't 
care to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long 
as they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due. 
As new religions spread through animist lands, those 
religions typically win adherents but not converts. 
People incorporate new spirits and deities into their 
prayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives 
and scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and 
practices without changing their belief in and respect 
for the spirits they already venerate. 
Animism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist 
clerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can 
choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for 
that cleric.
