INTRODUCTION 
r 
T'S GOOD TO BE THE DU NGEON MASTER! NOT ONLY 
d? y~u get to tell fantastic stories about heroes, 
v1llams, monsters, and magic, but you also get 
to create the world in which these stories live. 
Whether you're running a D&D game already 
or you think it's something you want to try, this 
book is for you. 
The Dungeon Master's Guide assumes that you know 
the basics of how to play the D&D tabletop roleplaying 
game. If you haven't played before, the DuNGEONS f!f> 
DRAGONS Starter Set is a great starting point for new 
players and DMs. 
This book has two important companions: the Player's 
Handbook, which contains the rules your players need 
to create characters and the rules you need to run the 
game, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to-
use monsters to populate your D&D world. 
THE DUNGEON MASTER 
The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force 
behind a D&D game. The DM creates a world for the 
other players to explore, and also creates and runs 
adventures that drive the story. An adventure typically 
hinges on the successful completion of a quest, and 
can be as short as a single game session. Longer 
adventures might embroil players in great conflicts that 
require multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung 
together, these adventures form an ongoing campaign. 
A D&D campaign can include dozens of adventures and 
last for months or years. 
A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the 
architect of a campaign, the DM creates adventures 
by placing monsters, traps, and treasures for the other 
players' characters (the adventurers) to discover. As 
a storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize 
what's happening around them, improvising when the 
adventurers do something or go somewhere unexpected. 
As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and 
supporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a 
referee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to 
abide by them and when to change them. 
Inventing, writing, storytelling, improvising, acting, 
refereeing-every DM handles these roles differently, 
and you'll probably enjoy some more than others. It 
helps to remember that DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a 
hobby, and being the DM should be fun. Focus .on the 
aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For example, if 
you don't like creating your own adventures, you can use 
published ones. You can also lean on the other players 
to help you with rules mastery and world-building. 
The D&D rules help you and the other players have 
a good time, but the rules aren't in charge. You're the 
DM, and you are in charge of the game. That said, your 
goal isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a 
campaign world that revolves around their actions and 
decisions, and to keep your players coming back for 
more! If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will 
echo in the memories of your players long after the final 
game session is concluded. 
INTRODUCTION 
How TO UsE THIS BooK 
This book is organized in three parts. The first part 
helps you decide what kind of campaign you'd like to 
run. The second part helps you create the adventures-
the stories-that will compose the campaign and 
keep the players entertained from one game session 
to the next. The last part helps you adjudicate the 
rules of the game and modify them to suit the style of 
your campaign. 
PART 1: MASTER OF WORLDS 
Every DM is the creator of his or her own campaign 
world. Whether you invent a world, adapt a world from 
a favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for 
the D&D game, you make that world your own over the 
course of a campaign. 
The world where you set your campaign is one of 
countless worlds that make up the D&D multiverse, 
a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures 
happen. Even if you're using an established world such 
as the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place 
in a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where 
Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital 
games are assumed to take place. The world is yours to 
change as you see fit and yours to modify as you explore 
the consequences of the players' actions. 
Your world is more than just a backdrop for 
adventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and countless 
other fantasy worlds out there, it's a place to which you 
can escape and witness fantastic stories unfold. A well-
designed and well-run world seems to flow around the 
adventurers, so that they feel part of something, instead 
of apart from it. 
Consistency is a key to a believable fictional 
world. When the adventurers go back into town for 
supplies, they should encounter the same nonplayer 
characters.(NPCs) they met before. Soon, they'll learn 
the barkeep's name, and he or she will remember 
theirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of 
consistency, you can provide an occasional change. If 
the adventurers come back to buy more horses at the 
stables, they might discover that the man who ran the 
place went back home to the large city over the hills, 
and now his niece runs the family business. That sort of · 
change- one that has nothing to do with the adventurers 
directly, but one that they'll notice- makes the players 
feel as though their characters are part of a living world 
that changes and grows along with them. 
Part 1 of this book is all about inventing your world. 
Chapter 1 asks what type of game you want to run, and 
helps you nail down a few important details about your 
world and its overarching conflicts. Chapter 2 helps you 
put your world in the greater context of the multiverse, 
expanding on the information presented in the Player's 
Handbook to discuss the planes of existence and the 
gods and how you can put them together to serve the 
needs of your campaign.
