HELM OF TELEPORTATION 
liELM OF TELEPATHY 
HELM OF TELEPATHY 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast 
the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as 
you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a 
bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature 
you are focused on. It can reply-using a bonus action to 
do so- while your focus on it continues. 
While focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, 
you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save 
DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, 
the suggestion property can't be used again until the 
next dawn. 
HELM OF TELEPORTATION 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can 
use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the teleport 
spell from it. The helm regains 1d3 expended charges 
daily at dawn. 
HEWARD'S HANDY HAVERSACK 
Wondrous item, rare 
This backpack has a central pouch and two side 
pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. 
Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, 
not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large 
central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds 
of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, 
regardless of its contents. 
Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal 
rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item 
from the haversack requires you to use an action. When 
you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item 
is always magically on top. 
The haversack has a few limitations. If it is 
overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
iiEWARO'S liANDY liAVERSACK 
haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack 
is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although 
an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the 
haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, 
unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before 
it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed 
within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 
10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. 
Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional 
space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or 
similar item instantly destroys both items and opens 
a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where 
the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature 
within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and 
deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. 
The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can·I 
be reopened. 
HOLY AVENGER 
Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by 
a paladin) 
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an 
undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 
radiant damage. 
While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura 
in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures 
friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. If you 
have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius o: 
the aura increases to 30 feet. 
HORN OF BLASTING 
Wondrous item, rare 
You can use an action to speak the horn's command 
word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderou 
blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. 
Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15
