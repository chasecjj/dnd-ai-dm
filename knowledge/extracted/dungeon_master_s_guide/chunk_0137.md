P I PES OF liAUNTING 
PIPES OF HAUNTING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
PiPES OF THE SEWERS 
You must be proficient with wind instruments to use 
these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action 
to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, 
spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you 
that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom 
saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. 
If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile 
toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. 
A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw 
is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The 
pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. 
PIPES OF THE SEWERS 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
You must be proficient with wind instruments to use 
these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary 
rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will 
not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. 
The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as 
an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 
3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats (see the 
Monster Manual for statistics) with each expended 
charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile 
of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by 
the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, 
the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the 
music by the shortest available route but aren't under 
your control otherwise. The pipes regain ld3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. 
Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another 
creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you 
are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check 
contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose 
the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would 
and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 
24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed 
by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and 
your companions for as long as you continue to play the 
pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys 
your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly 
swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. 
If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the 
pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and 
the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be 
swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. 
PLATE ARMOR OF ETHEREALNESS 
Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) 
While you're wearing this armor, you can speak its 
command word as an action to gain the effect of the 
etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until 
you remove the armor or use an action to speak the 
command word again. This property of the armor can't 
be used again until the next dawn. 
PORTABLE HOLE 
Wondrous item, rare 
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the 
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular 
sheet 6 feet in diameter. 
You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and 
place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the 
portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 
feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists
