OUR WORLD IS THE SETTING FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN, 
the place where adventures happen. Even 
if you use an existing setting, such as the 
Forgotten Realms, it becomes yours as you 
set your adventures there, create characters 
to inhabit it, and make changes to it over 
the course of your campaign. This chapter is all about 
building your world and then creating a campaign to 
take place in it. 
THE BIG PICTURE 
This book, the Player's Handbook, and the Monster 
Manual present the default assumptions for how the 
worlds of D&D work. Among the established settings of 
D&D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, 
and Mystara don't stray very far from those 
assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, 
Raven loft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further 
away from that baseline. As you create your own world, 
it's up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want 
your world to fall. 
CoRE AssuMPTIONS ______ _ 
The rules of the game are based on the following core 
assumptions about the game world. 
Gods Oversee the World. The gods are real and 
embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming 
dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, 
forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world 
by granting divine magic to their followers and sending 
signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god 
serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent 
seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its 
rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, 
none can deny their existence. 
Much of the World Is Untamed. Wild regions 
abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms 
of various sizes dot the Ia ndscape, but beyond their 
borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they 
live in well. They've heard stories of other places from 
merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond 
the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless 
they've been there themselves. 
The World Is Ancient. Empires rise and fall, leaving 
few places that have not been touched by imperial 
grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces 
eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with 
places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations 
and their knowledge survive in legends, magic 
items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an 
empire's collapse. 
Conflict Shapes the World's History. Powerful 
individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and 
factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course 
of history. Factions include religions led by charismatic 
prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and 
shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. 
The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as 
they compete with each other for power. Some seek to 
preserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others 
strive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with 
an iron fist. Still others seek goals that range from 
the practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation 
of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god. 
Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, 
creating conflict that can steer the world's fate. 
The World Is Magical. Practitioners of magic are 
relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of 
their craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous 
and commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to 
something much more rare and impressive, such as a 
levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates 
of a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches 
of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as 
magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters 
created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with 
magical abilities. 
IT's YouR WoRLD _______ _ 
In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with 
the core assumptions and consider how your setting 
might change them. The subsequent sections of this 
chapter address each element and give details on how to 
flesh out your world with gods, factions, and so forth. 
The assumptions sketched out above aren't carved 
in stone. They inspire exciting D&D worlds full of 
adventure, but they're not the only set of assumptions 
that can do so. You can build an interesting campaign 
concept by altering one or more of those core 
assumptions, just as well-established D&D worlds have 
done. Ask yourself, "What if the standard assumptions 
weren't true in my world?" 
The World Is a Mundane Place. What if magic is rare 
and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no 
access to it? What if your campaign is set in a version of 
our own world's history? 
The World Is New. What if your world is new, and 
the characters are the first of a long line of heroes? 
The adventurers might be champions of the first 
great empires, such as the empires of Netheril and 
Cormanthor in the Forgotten Realms setting. 
The World Is Known. What if the world is completely 
charted and mapped, right down to the "Here there be 
dragons" notations? What if great empires cover huge 
stretches of countryside, with clearly defined borders 
between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting 
were once part of a great empire, and magically aided 
travel between its cities is commonplace. 
Monsters Are Uncommo"n. What if monsters are 
rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific 
domains are governed by monstrous rulers. The 
populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords 
and their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble 
people's daily lives. 
Magic Is Everywhere. What if every town is ruled 
by a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are 
common? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic
