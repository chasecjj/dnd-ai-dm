C HAPTER 5: ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS 
ANY D&D ADVENTURES REVOLVE 
around a dungeon setting. Dungeons 
in D&D include great halls and tombs, 
subterranean monster lairs, labyrinths 
riddled with death traps, natural 
caverns extending for miles beneath the 
-urface of the world, and ruined castles. 
. ot every adventure takes place in a dungeon. A 
:ilderness trek across the Desert of Desolation or a 
arrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of Dread 
can be an exciting adventure in its own right. In the 
great outdoors, dragons wheel across the sky in search 
f prey, tribes of hobgoblins pour forth from their grim 
·ortresses to wage war against their neighbors, ogres 
plunder farmsteads for food, and monstrous spiders 
op from the web-shrouded canopies of trees. 
Within a dungeon, adventurers are constrained by 
:ails and doors around them, but in the wilderness, 
adventurers can travel in almost any direction they 
please. Therein lies the key difference between dungeon 
and wilderness: it's much easier to predict where the 
adventuring party might go in the dungeon because the 
ptions are limited- less so in the wilderness. 
illages, towns, and cities are cradles of civilization 
n a dangerous world, but they too offer opportunities 
· r adventure. Encounters with monsters ·might seem 
Jlllikely within a city's walls, but urban settings have 
· eir own villains and perils. Evil, after all, takes many 
·orms, and urban settings aren't always the safe havens 
.hey seem to be. 
This chapter provides an overview of these three 
environments plus a few unusual environments, taking 
:-ou through the process of creating an adventure 
ocation, with plenty of random tables to inspire you. 
DUNGEONS 
- me dungeons are old strongholds abandoned by the 
• lk who built them. Others are natural caves or weird 
..airs carved out by foul monsters. They attract evil cults, 
onster tribes, and reclusive creatures. Dungeons are 
o home to ancient treasures: coins, gems, magic 
-ems, and other valuables hidden away in the darkness, 
ften guarded by traps or jealously kept by the monsters 
· at have collected them. 
B uiLDING A DuNGEON 
-·:hen you set out to create a dungeon, think about its 
-· tinctive qualities. For example, a dungeon that serves 
- a hobgoblin stronghold has a different quality from 
an ancient temple inhabited by yuan-ti. This section 
ys out a process for creating a dungeon and bringing 
- to life.
