Ring of Water Elemental Command. You can expend 
2 of the ring's charges to cast dominate monster on a 
water elemental. In addition, you can stand on and walk

the ring, you gain access to the following additional

speed equal to your walking speed. 
You can cast the following spells from the ring, 
expending the necessary number of charges: create or 
destroy water (1 charge), control water (3 charges), ice 
storm (2 charges), or wall of ice (3 charges). 
RING OF EVASION 
Ring, rare (requires attunement) 
This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended

to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving 
throw instead.

invisible until you use another action to make it visible, 
until you remove the ring, or until you die. 
If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, 
unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the

in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with

if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
