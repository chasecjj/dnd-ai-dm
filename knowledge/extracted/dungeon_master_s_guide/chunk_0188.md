Determining Characteristics. The adventurers don't 
necessarily enter into a social interaction with a full 
understanding of a creature's ideal. bond, or flaw. If they 
want to shift a creature's attitude by playing on these 
characteristics, they first need to determine what the 
creature cares about. They can guess, but doing so runs 
the risk of shifting the creature's attitude in the wrong 
direction if they guess badly. 
After interacting with a creature long enough to get 
a sense of its personality traits and characteristics 
through conversation, an adventurer can attempt a 
Wisdom (Insight) check to uncover one of the creature's 
characteristics. You set the DC. A check that fails by 
10 or more might misidentify a characteristic, so you 
should provide a false characteristic or invert one of 
the creature's existing characteristics. For example, if 
an old sage's flaw is that he is prejudiced against the 
uneducated, an adventurer who badly fails the check 
might be told that the sage enjoys personally seeing to 
the education of the downtrodden. 
Given time, adventurers can also learn about a 
creature's characteristics from other sources, including 
its friends and allies, personal letters, and publicly told 
stories. Acquiring such information might be the basis 
of an entirely different set of social interactions. 
3. CHARISMA CHECK 
When the adventurers get to the point o( their 
request, demand, or suggestion- or if you decide the 
conversation has run its course- call for a Charisma 
check. Any character who has actively participated in 
the conversation can make the check. Depending on 
how the adventurers handled the conversation, the 
Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation skill might apply 
to the check. The creature's current attitude determines 
the DC required to achieve a specific reaction, as shown 
in the Conversation Reaction table. 
CONVERSATION REACTION 
DC 
Friendly Creature's Reaction 
0 
The creature does as asked without taking risks or 
making sacrifices. 
10

as asked. 
20 
The creature accepts a significant risk or sacrifice to 
do as asked. 
DC 
Indifferent Creature's Reaction 
0 
The creature offers no help but does no harm . 
10

sacrifices are involved.

as asked. 
DC 
Hostile Creature's Reaction 
0

might take risks to do so. 
10 
20 
The creature offers no help but does no harm. 
The creature does as asked as long as no risks or 
sacrifices are involved. 
Aiding the Check. Other characters who make 
substantial contributions to the conversation can help 
the character making the check. If a helping character 
says or does something that would influence the 
interaction in a positive way, the character making 
the Charisma check can do so with advantage. If 
the other character inadvertently says something 
counterproductive or offensive, the character making 
the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check. 
Multiple Checks. Certain situations might call for 
more than one check, particularly if the adventurers 
come into the interaction with multiple goals. 
4. REPEAT? 
Once a Charisma check has been made, further 
attempts to influence the target of the interaction might 
be fruitless or run the risk of upsetting or angering the 
subject creature, potentially shifting its attitude toward 
hostility. Use your best judgment. For example, if the 
party's rogue says something that pushes a noble's 
attitude toward the party from indifferent to hostile, 
another character might be able to diffuse the noble's 
hostility with clever roleplaying and a successful 
Charisma (Persuasion) check. 
RoLEPLAYING 
For some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn't 
come naturally for you, don't worry. The main thing is 
for you to have fun portraying your NPCs and monsters 
and to amuse your players in the process. You don't 
need to be a practiced thespian or comedian to create 
drama or humor. The key is to pay attention to the story 
elements and characterizations that make your players 
laugh or feel emotionally engaged and to incorporate 
those things into your roleplaying. 
BEING THE NPC 
Imagine how a character or monster you bring to life 
would react to the adventurers. Consider what it cares 
about. Does it have any ideals, flaws, or bonds? By 
working such things into your portrayal, you not only 
make the character or monster more believable, but you 
also enhance the sense that the adventurers are in a 
living world. 
Strive for responses and actions that introduce twists 
into the game. For example, an old woman whose family 
was killed at the hands of an evil wizard might regard 
the party's wizard with grave suspicion. 
However you roleplay a character or monster, the 
classic advice for writers holds true: show, don't tell. For 
example, rather than describe an NPC as shallow and 
self-centered, have the individual act the way you would 
expect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The 
NPC might have off-the-cuff answers for everything, 
an over-willingness to share personal anecdotes, and a 
desperate need to make himself or herself the subject of 
every conversation. 
USING YOUR VOICE 
Most of what you say during a session will be at a 
consistent level. For dramatic effect, be ready to shout 
out a battle cry or speak in a conspiratorial whisper.
