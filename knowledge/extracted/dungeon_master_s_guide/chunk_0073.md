VILLAIN 's SECRET WEAKNESS 
Finding and exploiting a villain's weakness can be 
very gratifying for players, although a smart villain 
tries to conceal its weakness. A lich, for example, has 
a phylactery- a magical receptacle for its soul- that it 
keeps well hidden. Only by destroying the phylactery 
can the characters ensure the lich's destruction.

VILLAINOUS 
CLASS OPTIONS 
You can use the rules in the Player's Handbook to create 
NPCs with classes and levels, the same way you create 
player characters. The class options below let you create 
two specific villainous archetypes: the evil high priest 
and the evil knight or anti paladin. 
The Death Domain is an additional domain choice for 
evil clerics, and the Oathbreaker offers an alternative 
path for paladins who fall from grace. A player can 
choose one of these options with the your approval. 
CLERIC : DEATH DOMAIN 
The Death domain is concerned with the forces that 
cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives 
rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, 
Myrkul, and WeeJas are patrons of necromancers, 
death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. 
Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubi . 
Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease 
or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the 
underworld (Hades and He!). 
DEATH DOMAIN SPELLS 
Cleric Level 
Spells

3rd

7th

9th

BONUS PROFICIENCY 
When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level, he or 
she gains proficiency with martial weapons. 
REAPER 
At 1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip 
of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric 
casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only 
one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures 
within range and within 5 feet of each other.
