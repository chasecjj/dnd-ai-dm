• A float topped by a life-size mechanical unicorn ridden 
by a mechanical drow ranger waving two scimitars 
(when a lever under the float is pulled, the unicorn 
farts a IS-foot cone of confetti, which it can do lwice 
before needing to be refilled) 
• A float topped with two mechanical goblins that re-
peatedly punch each other when wound up 
A float bearing a mechanical armored knight battling 
a mechanical pit fiend (when wound up, the knighl 
cleaves with its sword while the devil flaps its wings) 
Deflated black, blue. green, red, and white dragon 
balloons (they float magically when filled with air, and 
their size is Huge while inflaled) 
An enormous larrasque puppet for five puppeteers 
• Wagon covers decorated with tassels and painted with 
colorful patterns and creatures 
• Horse and ox harnesses, all brightly decorated 
Eyecatcher's Hold. The aft section of the hold of the 
Eyecatcher is guarded by four giant spiders painted 
in bright colors. These arachnids have been trained by 
jarlaxle since they were hatchlings, and they can pass 
themselves off as inanimate float decorations by remain-
ing perfectly still until they attack. They aren't hostile 
toward drow, whose lrue nature they sense despite the 
ship's illusion magic. Characters who have a passive 
Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher realize thal 
the spiders arc a lhreat before the crealures attack. 
All sorts of damaged and unfinished attractions are 
stored here. including the following: 
• A number of broken clockwork monsters 
• Half-completed or broken wagon covers and puppets 
• A deflated balloon of an oversized Aumph that has 
a small gash in it (a mending cantrip can repair 
the damage) 
• Ao undecorated float, topped with an unpainted me-
chanical gold dragon made of canvas stretched over a 
wooden frame 
Rigged with a glass canister of flammable gas, the me-
chanical gold dragon is designed to breathe fire when a 
lever is pulled. Pulling the lever cracks lhe canister and 
sets the dragon on fire. If the fire breaks out here and 
isn't extinguished promptly, it spreads lo other parts of 
the hold after 1 minute. Crew members in other parts of 
the ship detect smoke 5 minutes later, by which time the 
hold is a raging inferno. Crew members will focus on 
saving the submarine (if it's still attached) before aban-
doning ship. 
jl8. CRAFT SUPPLIES 
Eyecatcher and Hellraiser only 
Each of these cabins contains materials used to deco-
rate floats: 
• Glitter, feathers, fabric, paper, scissors, sewing nee-
dles, spools of colored thread, and flasks of glue are 
strewn over small tables. 
• Schematics for parade floats are tacked lo the walls 
alongside various tools. 
jl9. L OWE R CARGO H OLD 
Heartbreaker only 
Beastly odors fill the hold of the Hcartbreaker, becom-
ing stronger as the characters get closer to the creature 
pens (areaj20). The hold is mostly empty on parade 
days. On other days, it contains disassembled wagons 
(axles, wheels, and cages) that are used to pull exotic 
creatures through crowded streets. Tools needed to 
assemble and repair the wagons hang from hooks on 
the walls. 
Cargo Elevator. If the cargo elevalor platform is low-
ered to this area while creatures are in the 15-foot-by-
10-foot space where the platform lands, each of lhose 
creatures must succeed on a DC J 0 Dexterity saving 
throw or take I J (2dl0) bludgeoning damage and be 
knocked prone and restrained until the platform is 
raised. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw 
moves to a space of its choice next to the elevator plat-
form without provoking opportunity attacks. 
]20. CREATURE P ENS 
Heartbreaker only 
This section of the hold reeks of animal musk and 
waste. When they're not being paraded through city 
streets in cage-wagons, the monstrous attractions of 
the Sea Maidens Faire growl, chorlle, stamp, snort, 
and roar in closed stalls. Two handlers (commoners 
with proficiency in Animal Handling) walk from stall to 
stall. carrying buckets of food and speaking softly to the 
creatures. 
Each pen is effectively a cell equipped with a slid-
ing door that can be double-latched from the outside. 
A wagon assembled in areaj19 can be backed up to 
any pen. With the pen door open, a successful DC 15 
Wisdom (Animal Handling) check then coaxes a caged 
creature into the back of a wagon. This check is made 
with advantage if food is given to the creature. lf this 
check fails by 5 or more, the creature escapes, panics, 
and begins attacking indiscriminately as it tries to win 
its freedom. Any such ruckus alerts the animal handlers 
or other crew members if they are nearby. 
The following creatures are kept in the twelve pens: 
Two apes 
One rhinoceros 
One tiger 
One allosaurus 
Two panthers 
Oneowlbear 
Four giant fire beetles 
One bippogriff 
One axe beak 
Two death dogs 
One giant vulture 
One polar bear 
The death dogs and the giant vulture are evil, and the 
giant vullure can understand Common (though it can't 
speak). They seize any chance to escape and revel in the 
suffering of other creatures. 
j21. HANDLERS' CABIN 
Heartbreaker only 
This cabin contains hammocks for the two handlers 
who work in areaj20. Lf the creatures have been taken 
on parade, the handlers are asleep in their hammocks.
