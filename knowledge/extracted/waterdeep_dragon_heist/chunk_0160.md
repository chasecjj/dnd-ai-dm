WALKING STATUES OF WATERDEEP 
Scattered throughout Waterdeep are eight enormous 
statues that can defend the city in times of great peril. 
Because they are so destructive, the walking statues 
are used only to fend off armies and seemingly insur-
mountable foes. 
Each statue has a name and a unique appearance 
(see "The Walking Statues," page 182), but in terms 
of statistics they are similar. The statue known as the 
Sword maiden is too broken to be animated, and only the

Landmarks. Over the years, Waterdavians have built 
structures around and on top of several of the statues, 
believing them to be little more than landmarks at this 
point. ln their inanimate state, the statues pose little 
danger- but any structures attached to a walking statue 
are destroyed the first time it animates.

air, food, drink, or sleep. 
Crumbling Colossus. When the statue drops to 0 hit points, It 
crumbles and is destroyed. Any creature on the ground within 
30 feet of the crumbling statue must make a DC 22 Dexterity

save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Immutable Form. The statue is immune to any spell or effect 
that would alter its form.

against spells and other magical effects.

structures.

XANATHAR 
---
Xana1har is the name given to the beholder crime lord 
that lives in the dungeons under Waterdeep. It isn't the 
first beholder to claim this mantle, nor will it be the last. 
Like all beholders, Xanathar is a paranoid tyrant 
that charms and bullies its minions into servitude. The 
Xanathar Guild is made up of some of Waterdeep's 
most disreputable folk, as well as monsters forced into 
subservience or drawn to the beholder by the promise 
of treasure, food, or power. Treachery within the ranks 
of the guild is common as servants vie for the beholder·s 
favor and affection. Such boons are fleeting, though, as 
the beholder is quick to distrust those who finagle their 
way into its good graces. 
Xanathar lives in a dungeon under Skullport. a subter-
ranean settlement connected to Undermountain's third 
level. The place resembles a ramshackle town, built 
inside a giant cavern connected to an underground river. 
Members of the Xanathar Guild haunt Skullport's dilapi-
dated buildings, and flameskulls patrol its streets. 
The only creature Xanathar truly cares about aside 
from itself is a fish, named Sylgar. that it keeps in a large 
glass tank. Xanathar has minions that look after the fish 
constantly, but even their ministracions can't keep such 
a creature alive forever. Whenever the fish dies, panic 
spreads through the occupants of the lair as minions try 
to replace the fish before Xanathar realizes what has 
happened. Luckily for them, the beholder can't tell one 
fish from another. 
Xanathar is extremely fond of gold. A few years ago, 
its spies stole the Stone ofGolorr, which contained in-
formation that led to the discovery of a dwarven vault 
under Waterdeep. Xanathar was able to open the vault, 
but was forced out by the dragon inside the place. Re-
cently. someone stole the Stone ofGolorr from where it 
was hidden inside its lair, and the beholder is convinced 
that the Black Network is behind the theft. 
The beholder is caught up in the unbreakable grip 
of its own paranoia. It sees enemies everywhere. and 
lashes out at anyone it suspects of being a Zhentarim 
spy or assassin. Adventurers who attract its attention 
by dealing with known or suspected Black Network 
operatives are quickly branded as enemies that must be 
destroyed. 
GAME STATISTICS 
Xanathar is a beholder that wears magic rings on three 
of its eyestalks. It is attuned to all three rings, which 
don't alter the beholder's challenge rating. It wears a 
ring of invisibility on its fear ray eycstalk, a ring of mind 
shielding on its sleep ray eyestalk, and a ring of resis-
tance (force) on its slowing ray eycstalk. 
Xanathar's beloved fish, Sylgar, has the statistics of a 
quipper, except that it lacks the Blood Frenzy trait. 
YALAH GRALHUND 
The lady of House Gralhund is no fool. She has a keen 
mind and the wisdom to discern friend from foe. She 
also has a husband who worships her (see .. Orond Gral-
hund." page 213) and a house that has the resources of 
the Black Network at its disposal. 
~Pl't"NDIX 8 J MONSTERS .-\CllD NPCS 
Yalah stays abreast of events in the city, keeps a tight 
rein on her children, and uses her station and her fam-
ily's wealth to pry secrets from the lips of nobles, guild-
masters, and commoners alike. Though her previous 
attempts to become a Masked Lord have been thwarted, 
she believes it's only a matter of time until that honor 
is bestowed on her. Once she knows the identities and 
secrets of enough Masked Lords, Yalah is confident that 
she can bribe, blackmail, or extort her way into their 
ranks. From there, she plans to effect changes in the 
government that will ensure I louse Gralhund's prosper-
ity for generations to come. 
Yalah shares the services of a half-ore bodyguard with 
her husband, although Hrabbaz (see ''ffrabbaz," page 
205) is more loyal to her than to him. She aJso uses 
the Zhentarim who are based in House Gralhund as 
her personal spy network, not realizing that the Zhents' 
true master is Manshoon. Most of her dealings are with 
the Zhcnt master assassin Urstul Floxin (see "Urstul 
Floxin," page 216), whom she treats as an underling. 
CAME STATISTICS 
Yalah Gralhund is a Tethyrian human noble, with 
these changes: 
• Yalah is neutral evil. 
• She has an InteJligence of 16 (+3). 
• She speaks Common and Infernal.
