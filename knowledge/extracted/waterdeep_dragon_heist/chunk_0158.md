Vajra isn't the city's most powerful wizard, but she can 
hold her own. Despite her many gifts, she still ques-
tions her ability to meet the demands of her role, and 
she rarely makes a decision without first soliciting the 
advice of the Blackstaff, which contains Khelben Arun-

spies and from Harper agents.

out of Blackstaff Tower in the Castle Ward. She is also 
in charge of Force Grey, an order of highly skilled adven-
turers who are called upon to defend the city in times
