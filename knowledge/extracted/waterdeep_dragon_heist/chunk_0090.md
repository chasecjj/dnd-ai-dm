CHAPTER 7: MAESTRO'S FALL 
ARLAXLE, THE LEADER OP BRECAN D'AERTHE, 
sees membership in the Lords' Alliance as 
his path to power beyond Luskan. As the 
secret lord of a city with an unsavory repu-
tation, he has had a hard time getting a seat 
at the table with other cities of the North 
when it comes to trade and defense of the 
region. Thus, he plans to use the stolen gold 
to bargain with Laeral Silverhand for inclusion in the 
alliance, and to oust Neverwinter and its lord DaguJt 
Neverember- Jarlaxle's fiercest political opponent- from 
the group. 
FACING jARLAXLE 
As the characters investigate the Sea Maidens Faire, 
they could run into Jarlaxle, especially if they take a 
kick-in-the-door approach and storm the vessels of the 
traveling carnival. When Jarlaxle learns that the char-
acters are aboard one of his ships, he arranges to meet 
with them in the guise of Zardoz Zord. If they refuse, 
Jarlaxle orders his crew to cast the characters over-
board- or takes care of the job himself if he must. 
If he thinks the adventurers can be trusted, jarlaxle 
proposes that they join his search for the Vault of Drag-
ons. He intends to return the gold to Laeral Silverhand, 
less 5,000 gp for the characters in exchange for their 
help. He offers another 5,000 gp for their help in recov-
ering the dragonstaff of Ahghairon. If the characters 
accept,jarlaxle upholds his end of the agreement. Once 
the gold is secure, he gives the characters their cut. 
If the characters don't agree to jarlaxle's terms, or if 
they assault him, he tries to knock them unconscious 
and leave them without clothes or equipment in a gutter 
in the Dock Ward. He stores their equipment in areajl6 
aboard the Eyecatcher, with the exception of any magic 
items. Those be stashes in area U4 aboard the Scarlet 
Marpenoth, his secret submarine. 
In the unlikely event tbatjarlaxle is killed, Bregan 
D'aerthe raises him from the dead within a tenday. Once 
he's back in action, he tries to recover any gear that was 
stolen from him. 
DISRUPTI NG j ARLAXLE'S OPERATION 
Characters can hinder Jarlaxle in the ways described in 
the following two subsections. 
DESTROYTHE FIGUREHEADS 
The figureheads onjarlaxle's ships (areaJ8) create illu-
sions around drow crew members, making them appear 
human. If a figurehead is destroyed, the drow on that 
ship remain belowdecks to ensure that they don't draw 
unwanted attention. 
SINK OR STEAL A VESSEL 
If the characters sink or steal one of his sailing ships 
or the Scarlet Marpenoth,Jarlaxle tasks his crew mem-
bers with finding out what went wrong. In the case 
of a sunken ship, such wanton destruction could also 
involve the City Watch, especially if the act results in 
people drowning.

S EA M AIDENS FAIRE 
jarlaxle Baenre's seafaring carnival travels up and 
down the Sword Coast in three ships. The Eyecatcher, 
jarlaxle's flagship, is ostentatious. Mounted underneath 
it is the Scarlet Marpenoth, a submarine of Lantanese 
design. The second ship, the Hear/breaker, is primarily 
used to transport performers, strange creatures, and 
wagons. The third ship, the Hellraiser, transports musi-
cians and decorative floats. The Heartbreaker and the 
Hellraiser are presently docked. while the Eyecatcher is 
anchored in the harbor. 
All three ships are crewed by drow who are magically 
disguised to appear human. Despite their disguises, the 
drow still have the SunHght Sensitivity trait. 
APPROACHING THE SHIPS 
The Heartbreaker and the Hellraiser are docked across 
from each other at the same pier in the Dock Ward. The 
characters need only walk up a ramp from the pier to 
areajl on either ship. The pier is so busy that no one 
takes notice of the characters until they are on a vessel. 
jarlaxle's flagship is anchored in Deepwater Harbor, a 
mile away from his other ships. To reach the Eyecatcher, 
the characters must travel there by using another vessel, 
by swimming, or by flying. If the characters approach 
in a vessel known to the crew. such as a rowboat from 
another of jarlaxle's ships, the characters arouse no 
suspicion until they are seen on deck. The crew of the 
Eyecatcher crew sends word to jarlaxle immediately if 
the characters approach in an unknown vessel. 
If the characters approach the Eyecatcher in an un-
derwater vehicle, such as Grinda Garloth's apparatus 
of Kwa/ish (see chapter 4), the character piloting must 
succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check to keep 
the vehicle from being spotted by the crew of the Scarlet 
Marpenoth. If the characters approach by swimming, 
each of them must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity 
(Stealth) check to avoid being spotted by the crew of the 
Eyecatcher. 
CREWS 
The characters can learn valuable information by inter-
rogating crew members and carnival performers. 
SH IP CAPTAINS 
Although Zardoz Zord Uarlaxle Baenre) commands the 
Heel, each ship has its own captain: a Bregan D'aertbe 
drow mage disguised as a slender, well-dressed human. 
These captains know of jarlaxle's plans. They communi-
cate with each other and with jarlaxle by way of sending 
spells, which they prepare instead of fly. 
Velgos Ephezzrin captains the Hellraiser in the guise 
of a human named Fergus Crabwater. He enjoys wine a 
little too much, and characters have advantage on Cha-
risma checks made to interact with him during a meal. 
Tylan Ilueph captains the Heartbreaker as a human 
named Klarr Besham. He's a humorless taskmaster 
whose tarantula familiar is always on his shoulder. 
Llorath Pham captains the Eyecalcher as a human 
named Tarwind Arryhook. He loves games of chance 
and can't resist a good wager. 
CHAPTl!R 7 I MAESTRO'S FALL 
A successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persua-
sion) check and the mention of Zardoz Zord's name is 
enough lO gain an audience with a ship captain. If the 
characters capture one of the captains and succeed on 
a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, they learn the 
following information by asking the right questions: 
• "The Sea Maidens Faire and all its ships are under 
the command of Captain Zardoz Zord of Luskan." (A 
ship captain won't divulge Zord's true identity unless 
magically compelled to do so.) 
• "Zord has a cabin aboard the Eyecatcher and spends a 
lot of Lime there with Margo Verida and Khafeyta Mur-
zan, two of the Faire's star performers." 
• "A year ago, the Sea Maidens Faire visited the island 
nation of Lantan, where Zord acquired a submarine 
called the Scarlet Marpenoth. The submarine is 
mounted underneath the Eyecatcher." 
"Zord has operatives searching for an artifact called 
the Stone ofGolorr, which leads to a place called the 
Vault of Dragons." (For security, the captains aren't 
kept informed as to the mission's progress.) 
• "Zord has drow spies in Waterdeep- Fel'rekt Lafeen, 
Krebbyg Masq'il'yr. and Soluun Xibrindas. All carry 
Lantanese firearms." 
• "Our disguises are powered by a magical figurehead 
fixed to the fore of each ship." 
SAILORS 
The Eyecatcher, the Heartbreaker, and the Hellraiser 
are crewed by twenty sailors each: three drow elite 
warriors (mates) and seventeen drow, all magically dis-
guised as slender humans while aboard their vessel. All 
are loyal members of Bregan D'aerthe, and all know that 
Zardoz Zord isjarlaxle Baenre in disguise. They know 
nothing about the Scarlet Marpenoth or jarlaxle's plans. 
The crew has orders not to fraternize with strangers 
or guests. Characters who question crew members can 
learn the following: 
• "Zardoz Zord is master of the Sea Maidens Faire. If 
you want to meet him, talk to a ship captain." (A sailor 
won't divulge Zord's true identity unless magically 
compelled to do so.) 
• "The Sea Maidens Faire is based out ofLuskan." 
CARNIES 
Most of the carnival performers and workers are human 
commoners trained to perform a handful of tasks or 
stunts. (Performers have proficiency in the Performance 
skill.) They're kept in the dark about most things, but 
they're not oblivious. With a successful DC 10 Charisma 
check, a character can cajole or trick a carny into reveal-
ing one of the following pieces of information: 
• "Zardoz Zord uses magic to get from the Eyecatcher 
to the other boats. I've never seen him in a rowboat." 
• ·'The sailors communicate with each other using 
odd hand signals." (Members of Bregan D'aerthe use 
Drow Sign Language.) 
• "All the sailors have an aversion to sunlight:' 
• ''Have you noticed the sailors have the slightest hint of 
an Elvish accent?" 
• "All the crew members are men. Very odd."
