since he can't easily carry the dragonstaff of Ahghairon 
in dragon form. The dragon attacks only in defense of 
itself, the staff, or the gold. The only individuals autho-
rized to remove the gold under Aurinax's watch are 
Dagult Neverember and his appointed vassals, none of 
whom are currently in Waterdeep. 
The characters can try to convince Aurinax that they 
have come on Neverember's behalf. Since he has never 
met them before or heard Neverember mention them 
by name, Aurinax is doubtful of their story. Fooling the 
dragon requires each character within his line of sight to 
succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by 
the dragon's Wisdom (Insight) check. If even one char-
acter loses the contest, Aurinax senses that the group is 
lying to him. These checks are made with advantage if 
Renaer Neverember is with the party, since the dragon 
remembers meeting Renaer when he was but a child 
and can easily imagine a scenario in which Dagult Nev-
erember might use his son as his vassal. (The dragon 
knows nothing of the animosity between Renaer and 
his father.) 
The characters can try to convince the noble dragon 
that Lord Neverember embezzled the gold from the 
people ofWaterdeep, and that it would be fair and just 
to see the coin safely returned to its rightful owners. 
Deep down, Aurinax knows where the gold came from, 
but the dragon has allowed his greed and his agreement 
with Lord Neverember to cloud his moral judgment. 
With a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check, 
a character can talk the dragon into allowing the gold to 
be returned to the people to whom it rightfully belongs. 
The check is made with advantage if the characters 
brought a prominent city official with them, such as Mirt 
or Vajra Safahr, or if one of the characters professes to 
be a worshiper of Bahamut. 
Any Charisma (Intimidation) check made to influence 
Aurinax automatically fails. After the first such attempt, 
all future Charisma checks made by the party to influ-
ence Aurinax have disadvantage. 
Aurinax uses Legendary Resistance to avoid being 
charmed. If a character tries to charm him with a spell 
and fails, all future Charisma checks made by the party 
to influence Aurinax have disadvantage. 
Treasure. Choose two alcoves in the vault. Piled in 
one alcove are 500,000 gp, the combined weight of 
which is 10,000 pounds. Scattered on the floor of the 
second alcove are sixty-five 100 gp gemstones-all that 
remains of Aurinax's current food supply. 
Aurinax won't give up his gemstones or the dragon-
sta.ff of Ahghairon willingly, since they are his payment 
for guarding the gold. If need be, however, the dragon 
is willing to use the staff's power on behalf of the city in 
exchange for more gemstones. 
LEAVING THE VAULT 
As the characters leave the vault, with or without the 
gold, they are confronted by a hostile force sent by the 
main villain or villains. If the vault doors were left open, 
the characters encounter these antagonists in area V2; 
otherwise, they're lurking outside the vault, waiting for 
the characters to emerge: 
• IfXanathar is the main villain, Noska Ur'gray (see 
appendix B) arrives with six bugbears and a gazer 
(see appendix B). If Noska is dead or otherwise indis-
posed, the beholder replaces him with Nar'l Xibrindas 
(see appendix B) and his grell bodyguard. 
• If the Cassalanters are the villains, they send three 
cult fanatics and three cultists. Victoro's doppel-
ganger manservant, Willi fort Crowelle, leads the 
group in his tiefting guise unless the characters killed 
him or otherwise disposed of him earlier in this chap-
ter or in chapter 6. 
Ifjarlaxle Baenre (see appendix B) is the villain, he 
arrives with three drow gunslingers (see appendix B). 
Replace no-name drow gunslingers with Fel'rekt La-
feen, Krebbyg Masq'il'yr, and Soluun Xibrindas if they 
are alive and free. 
If Manshoon is the main villain, he sends his simula-
crum (see appendix B) along with Agorn Fuoco (NE 
male Turami human bard; see appendix B), Yevette 
Blackwater (CE female Tethyrian human swashbuck-
ler; see appendix B), and three Zhent thugs. If Agorn 
and Yevette were killed or otherwise disposed of 
earlier in this chapter or in chapter 8, replace each of 
them with one additional thug. 
The forces sent by Xanathar, the Cassalanters, and 
Manshoon attack the characters on sight.jarlaxle, on 
the other hand, congratulates characters for unlocking 
the Vault of Dragons and allows them to leave on the 
condition that they go empty-handed. He intends to see 
the gold safely returned to the city ofWaterdeep but also 
demands the dragonstaff of Ahghairon for his trouble. 
If Aurinax is alive, the characters can lure enemies to 
the dragon. Aurinax attacks any creature that attacks 
him or tries to steal his staff or the gold. He also defends 
the characters if he has made a deal with them. 
FACTION REINFORCEMENTS 
If the characters joined one or more factions in Water-
deep and kept them informed of their progress, you can 
have reinforcements arrive to help combat the villains or 
introduce a new element to the situation. 
Bregan D'aerthe. If jarlaxle Baenre (see appendix 
B) isn't the main villain, he arrives with his lieutenants, 
Fel'rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg Masq'il'yr, and Soluun Xibrin-
das, or three other drow gunslingers (see appendix B). 
jarlaxJe offers to help the characters if they agree to help 
him secure the gold for Waterdeep and the dragonstaff 
of Ahghairon for himself. 
Harpers. Mirt (see appendix B) arrives with two 
female human swashbucklers (see appendix B). If 
he's still alive and not already with the characters, Re-
naer Neverember (see appendix B) replaces one of the 
swashbucklers. 
Emerald Enclave. jeryth Phaulkon sends three 
swarms of rats to assist the characters. Once the char-
acters are no longer in peril, the rats disperse through-
out the vault. 
Force Grey. Vajra Safahr sends Meloon Wardragon 
(see appendix B) to help the characters secure the vault, 
unaware that Meloon has fallen under Xanathar's sway. 
If Xanathar is the main villain, Meloon helps the behold-
er's forces defeat the characters.
