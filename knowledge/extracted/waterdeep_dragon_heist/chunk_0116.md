TRAFFIC WARDENS 
During particularly heavy traffic and at congested ar-
eas such as the great oval road around the Market, you 
might see a member of the City Watch serving as a traf-
fic warden. Traffic wardens signal with small blue hand 
flags for traffic to proceed, and with yellow flags for traf-
fic to hold. A traffic warden can often be heard blowing 
a whistle. When you hear it, look to the warden to see if 
you are being signaled. Failure to take care might result 
not only in accident but also arrest. 
D RAYS 
These towering vehicles are, I believe, unique to Water-
deep. Invented by exiles from Lantan in the last century, 
a dray is a long, glassed-in carriage with bench seating 
that provides additional open-air bench seating on its 
roof. The driver sits at the level of the roof seating, pro-
viding a vantage point to see over other traffic and make 
eye contact with other dray drivers. You can enter this 
contraption through the back whenever it stops or slows 
down enough to make mounting the rear step safe. 
A fare taker stands al the back of the lower seating 
area to take your coin (typically 2 to 4 nibs). You can 
choose to ride inside or ascend the spiral stairway at 
the rear to ride atop the vehicle. Most drays run on the 
main north- south boulevards, but some circle the Mar-
ket, and a few run along the smaller east-west roads 
in rough areas. Be warned that when the demand for 
drays is high- during rain or snow, or to get to or from 
an event al the Field of Triumph- conditions become 
crowded and perfect for pickpockets. 
HI RE- COACH ES 
If you desire to travel in relative comfort and be the mas-
ter of your destination, simply give a spirited wave and 
shout to any hire-coach driver who has no passengers. 
Each of these handsome, two-wheeled black coaches 
comfortably seats two travelers (perhaps four if you're 
quite slim and very well acquainted), who ride facing the 
road ahead. The hire-coach's driver sits high and to the 
rear of the carriage, manipulating the horses by means 
of long reins and a short whip on a rod. The fare must 
THE UNFLAPPABLE WATERDAVIAN 
Natives of the City of Splendors are notoriously slow to 
take offense. A Waterdavian plainly states their feelings 
as a warning, so that one is apt to hear "I don't find 
that amusing, friend," said pleasantly before real anger 
is shown. Some visitors misinterpret such behavior as 
cowardice or ignorance ("He was too stupid to realize I 
insulted him!"). For those who act on such misjudgments, 
however, surprise and regret are the usual results. 
Most Waterdavians are also slow to take fright unless 
facing magic or monsters. A swaggering warrior threat-
ening them is quite likely to be stared at calmly, or even 
sneered at. ''The only mortals that Waterdavians fear are 
a few unstable wizards and the Lords," Durnan often says 
to those who are surprised by the nonchalance of the 
Yawning Portal's regulars concerning the open entrance 
to Undermountain in their midst. "And only when they've 
incurred the wrath of said persons themselves." 
be agreed upon and paid before the journey, but only 
rarely will the cost exceed a half-dozen shards. 
CARRIAGES 
The well-to-do- or those who want to ride in luxury 
during a day out- can hire a full carriage, many of which 
are as finely outfitted as those owned by the nobility. Up 
to eight can take such a ride in silken comfort. Prices 
and services vary, but generally you agree to rent the 
carriage, the services of the driver, and any attendant 
servants or guards for a full day. 
TRAVEL I N W I NTER 
The folk of Waterdeep often remain indoors in the 
colder months, particularly when it rains or snows. The 
flow of trade and travelers into the city slows to a trickle 
during winter, and as a result, traffic diminishes and 
drays and hire-coaches become more scarce. Fortu-
nately, the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen works 
with the Wheelwrights' Guild and the Wagon-makers' 
and Coach Builders' Guild to convert the drays and hire-
coaches that do operate into sledges, so that some are 
available even in the worst weather.
