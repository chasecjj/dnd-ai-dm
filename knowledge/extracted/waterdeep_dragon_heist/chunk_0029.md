ESIDENTS OF TuOLLSKULL ALLEY ARE SHAKEN 
by a loud whoosh, rattling windows, and the 
screams of city folk. A fireball spell has just 
detonated in the street, and the neighborhood 
is thrown into chaos. As members of the City 
Guard, the City Watch, and the Watchful Order 
of Magists and Protectors rush to the scene, 
the characters are afforded a chance to assess the 
damage and investigate further. This incident sets into 
motion the main plot and puts the characters on a colli-
sion course with those who want to find and claim Lord 
Neverember's hidden cache of gold. 
The fireball goes off early in the morning, at a time 
when all the characters are in Trollskull Manor. Read 
aloud the following text ro set the scene: 
Windows rattle as the roar of an explosion fills Trollskull 
Alley. Charred bodies and anguished screams Ay through 
the air. A thick cloud of acrid smoke billows outward 
from the blast, which seems to have occurred right out-
side your door. 
Let the players tell you what their characters are doing 
at this moment and how they react to the explosion. 
Those who want to guess the nature of the explosion 
can, with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) 
check, conclude that someone just cast a fireball 
spell outside. 
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? 
Dalakhar, a rock gnome spy working for Lord Dagult 
Neverember, was on his way to see the characters when 
the fireball went off, killing him and ten other people. 
The gnome is important because he was carrying the 
Stone ofGolorr(see appendix A)-the key to finding 
Lord Neverember's hidden cache of gold. 
Hounded by agents of the Zhentarim, the Xanathar 
Guild, and Bregan D'aerthe. Dalakhar was unable to 
escape from Waterdeep with the artifact, so he planned 
to entrust it to the characters briefly, for surely the folk 
who rescued Lord Neverember's son could keep it safe 
where he could not. 
By the time the events of this chapter have played 
out, the Stone ofGolorr has changed hands a few times 
and the characters have learned more about the big pic-
ture-though they still have a long chase ahead of them. 
ZHENTS CAUGHT IN THE ACT 
Three members of the Black etwork, including the 
Zhent assassin Urstul Floxin (see appendix B), were 
close to nabbing Dalakhar when they were caught in the 
blast. Of the three, only Urstul survived. Though he was 
wounded, he was able to pluck the Stone ofGolorr from 
Dalakhar's pocket before fleeing the scene. While other 
survivors were coming to their senses, Urstul stumbled 
through the smoke and haze and eventually made his 
way back to Gralhund Villa a short distance away. 
CHAPTER 3 I FIREBALL

HOUSE G RALHUND ---
The heads of the Gralhund noble family, Yalah Gralhund 
and her husband, Orond, are providing coin and shel-
ter to Urstul and his fellow Zhents in exchange for the 
promise of getting their fair share of the hidden cache 
of gold. But the Gralhunds aren't willing to put their 
trust entirely in the Black Network; they sent out their 
own agent to shadow the Zhents, eliminate Dalakhar, 
and obtain the Stone ofGolorr on their behalf. Yalah 
gave the would-be assassin a necklace of fireballs with 
instructions on how and when to use it. When it seemed 
as though Dalakhar might give Urstul Floxin the slip, 
this agent hurled one of the beads from the necklace to 
stop the gnome in his tracks. 
The Gralhunds' assassin is a nirnblewright (see 
appendix B) that escaped from the House oflnspired 
Hands, the temple ofGond in the Sea Ward, a month 
ago. The construct hitched a ride on House Gralhund's 
coach. Yalah Gralhund befriended it, offered it shelter, 
and used it as a servant until she and her husband found 
a more sinister use for it. 
The incident with the fireball has strained the alliance 
between the Gralhunds and the Black Network. Urstul 
Floxin is refusing to hand over the Stone ofGolorr until 
he speaks to his secret master, Manshoon. Meanwhile, 
the Gralhunds are weighing the risks of betraying and 
murdering Urstul in their own house. If the characters' 
investigation go well, they'll blunder into this den of 
snakes before the chapter is done. 
UNRAVELING THE P LOT 
During their investigation, the characters should learn 
who or what cast the fireball (a nimblewright), why the 
attack was commitled (to steal the Stone ofGolorr), and 
where the stone was taken (Gralhund Villa). lf the inves-
tigation stalls, friendly NPCs might step forward to help 
in exchange for compensation. One such figure is Vin-
cent Trench, the private detective, who lives in Trollskull 
Alley (see chapter 2, area TS). The characters can also 
consult with friendly factions such as the Harpers. 
THE CRIME SCENE 
In the wake of the explosion, people emerge from their 
houses and shops to survey the devastation. The fire-
ball didn't set any buildings ablaze, but it left eleven 
people dead: 
• One elderly female human who was out for a walk (no 
one recognizes her) 
• Two cloaked male humans (Zhentarim sellswords) 
clad in leather armor with sheathed longswords 
Two female humans and one male half-elf dressed in 
plain clothes (servants of wealthy North Ward fami-
lies, killed while running errands) 
• One male gnome (Dalakhar) wearing a burned cloak 
and clutching a dagger 
• Two female halflings who were playing a flute and a 
fiddle, and two male halflings who were dancing 
The characters have only a few minutes to search 
the crime scene before members of the City Guard ar-
rive. After that, they aren't allowed anywhere near the 
OH APT£R 3 I FIRl!BALl. 
bodies, although invisible and similarly hidden charac-
ters can search the crime scene further. A search of the 
bodies accompanied by a successful DC lS Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals the following: 
• One of the dead male humans has a black, winged 
snake (the symbol of the Black Network) tattooed on 
his right forearm. 
• The dead gnome has dry waste on his boots and 
cloak, suggesting he has spent time in the sewers 
recently. He also has a pouch containing five 100 gp 
gemstones. 
A character can try to snatch Dalakhar's pouch with-
out being seen by NPC onlookers, doing so with a suc-
cessful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a 
failed check, the character still acquires the pouch, but 
someone observes the theft and reports it to City Watch 
constables once they show up (see "The Watch Arrives" 
below). This witness to the theft can be silenced with a 
bribe of SO gp or more. 
AFTER THE BLAST 
The characters have a few minutes to examine the 
crime scene before the City Guard arrives and cordons 
off Trollskull Alley, posting six guards at each entrance. 
The guards don't allow anyone in or out without permis-
sion from a superior officer. Another six guards, includ-
ing a sergeant with 18 hit points, make their way to the 
crime scene and watch over the dead bodies until the 
City Watch arrives. Lingering smoke from the fireball 
also attracts a Griffon Cavalry rider (see appendix B). 
As its griffon mount circles the neighborhood, the rider 
watches the streets and alleys for suspicious figures. 
THE W AT CH ARRIVES 
Twenty minutes after the explosion, a City Watch ser-
geant named Saeth Cromley (see appendix B) escorts 
a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protec-
tors named Barnibus Blastwind (see appendix B) to the 
crime scene. Barnibus quietly takes charge of the inves-
tigation at that point, while Sergeant Cromley directs a 
force of twenty constables (veterans) to knock on doors 
and question locals. 
Before allowing the corpses to be removed and taken 
to local temples, Barnibus inspects the scene closely 
and reaches the following conclusions, which he prefers 
to keep to himself but might share with other members 
of the Watchful Order: 
• The gnome was running from armed pursuers, of 
which there were three. The third person who was 
chasing the gnome isn't among the dead. 
• The gnome and his pursuers were moving toward the 
tavern in Trollskull Alley (which Barnibus will soon 
come to realize is the characters' property). 
• Neither the gnome nor his pursuers saw the 
blast coming. 
Given these findings, Barnibus decides to question 
the tavern's owners and occupants, with Sergeant 
Cromley by his side as a witness and bodyguard. Spe-
cifically, Barnibus wants to find out the gnome's identity 
and whether he was known to anyone. The characters,
