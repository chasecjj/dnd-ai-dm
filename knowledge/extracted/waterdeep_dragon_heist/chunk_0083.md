C3. LIBRARY 
This is the Cassalanters· private library. It contains the 
following features: 
• The scent of old parchment hangs thick in the air. 
• The walls are lined with tall shelves packed with col-
orful, leather-bound books. Each bookshelf is outfitted 
with a ladder on a rolling track to enable people to 
reach the highest books. 
• S helves that take up the entire southwest wall hold 
not books but eighty wide-necked glass bottles filled 
with swirling mist and sealed with corks. 
Hanging on the north wall between two bookshelves 
is a 7-foot-tall portrait of Lord and Lady Cassalanter 
holding two infant children and standing beside 
their teenage son. Osvaldo. (This portrait conceals a 
secret door.) 
If Terenzio and Elzerina are here. they're playing on 
the sliding ladders. 
Books. None of the books are magical. 
jars of Mist. The glass bottles on the southwest shelf 
contain magically captured sounds, including songs, op-
eras, and recorded lectures. Uncorking a bottle tempo-
rarily releases its auditory contents into the library. after 
which the sound returns to its bottle. Breaking a bottle 
releases the sound, but the sound dissipates after it 
plays once. All the bottles are labeled. Sample contents 
include the following: 
• "Ahghairon's Dragonward," a lecture given by Khelben 
Arunsun about the dragonward that protects Water-
deep (see "Ahghairon's Dragonward," page 6). 
• "Canticle of the Silver Chalice," a hymn to the demi-
god Siamorphe. 
Wulfgar and the Crystal Shard, an epic opera detailing 
the adventures of a barbarian, a dwarf, and a drow in 
lcewind Dale. 
"Your Beardy Face," a traditional dwarven love song 
popular in the Moonsea region. 
Secret Door. The Cassalanter family portrait hides 
a secret door. Tilting the painting causes the door to 
swing outward on hidden hinges, revealing the pantry 
(area Cl 1) beyond. A character can notice a slight gap 
beneath the secret door with a successful DC 18 Wis-
dom (Perception) check. 
C4. READING ROOM 
This reading nook has the following features: 
• Lighc pours into this room through four tall bay win-
dows that look out on the butterHy garden (area C25). 
Furnishings include a luxurious armchair and a small 
side table where an empty wine glass sits atop a 
small book. 
• A door in the northern wall has a butterfly-shaped, 
stained-glass peephole. 
lfVictoro Cassalanter (see appendix B) is here, he's 
reading a historical text titled The Rise and Fall of Hell-
gate Keep and taking notes in his journal. 
journal. The small book on the side table is a journal 
that Victoro Cassalanter uses to take notes while read-
ing. It mostly contains dry observations on atlases of 
CH APTER 6 I HELL OF A SUMMBR 
FaerOn and history books. A character who flips through 
the journal and succeeds on a DC IS Intelligence (Inves-
tigation) check can pick out a few notes made by Victoro 
that are unrelated to his reading: 
• "Neverember's dragons are an answer to our prayers." 
• "The Cassalanter mausoleum. Inform Y. G." (The ini-
tials refer to Lady Yalah Gralhund.) 
"Golorr is an aboleth. Now it all makes sense." 
If the characters are still searching for the Stone 
ofGolorr in chapter 4, you can include in this jour-
nal a clue regarding the stone's location. (If the Cas-
salanters have the stone. it's hidden in area C6 when it's 
not in use.) 
C5. FOYER 
Two guards in House Cassalanter livery are stationed in 
this marble-floored foyer al all hours. lt has seven exits: 
A door to the entrance hall (area Cl) 
An open arch that leads to a spacious dining 
room (area C9) 
Three unmarked doors on the east wall (to areas C6, 
C7, and C8) 
A grand staircase that ascends to the second Boor 
(area C13) 
An unassuming door under the stairs that leads to the 
cellar (area C26) 
Founders' Day. The foyer is filled with lavish bou-
quets in ceramic floor vases and wealthy guests chatting 
loudly and drinking sparkling wine, while the gentle 
music of a string quartet drifts down from upstairs . 
C6. V t c TORo's OFFICE 
The door to this room is locked. The room contains the 
following features: 
• Tall stacks of legal tomes and financial ledgers rest 
atop a solid mahogany desk. 
• A freestanding suit of bronze armor (complete 
with helm, gauntlets, and greatsword) stands just 
inside the door. 
If Victoro Cassalanter (see appendix B) is here, he's 
seated behind the desk with fingers steepled, deep 
in thought. 
Armor. The suit of armor standing by the door is a 
helmed horror. It obeys Victoro's commands. When 
Victoro isn't present, it attacks anyone who opens the 
door without a key or anyone not of Cassalanter blood 
who opens Victoro's desk. The Cassalanter children 
know about this construct and warn friendly charac-
ters about it. 
Desk. Victoro's desk is locked and can be opened 
with Victoro's golden key. A character can pick the 
lock by succeeding on a DC 18 Dexterity check using 
thieves' tools. The desk drawer contains thirteen sealed 
scroll tubes, a signed contract inside each one. These 
contracts outline the terms of loans made by Victoro 
to various nobles, merchants, and guilds. The drawer 
also has a secret compartment that characters can find 
with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. It 
holds a holy symbol of Asmodeus crafted from solid gold 
(worth 250 gp).
