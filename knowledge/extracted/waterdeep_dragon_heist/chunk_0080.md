ICTORO ANO AM MALIA CASSA LANTER STRUCK 
a deal with Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine 
Hells. Three years ago. they traded away the 
souls of their children to escape financial 
ruin. The soul of their eldest son. Osvaldo, 
was taken immediately. What was left behind 
was transformed into a chain devil, which 
the Cassalanters confined to their attic. 
Their two youngest children, Terenzio and Elzerina, are 
doomed to lose their souls when they turn nine years 
old a mere ten days after Founders' Day, a midsummer 
festival that celebrates Waterdeep's founding. 
After the deal was struck, the Cassalanters enjoyed a 
miraculous comeback. Their banking and money-lend-
ing business thrived while their competition suffered. 
The disappearance of their eldest son (and heir appar-
ent) earned them sympathy. Their philanthropic en-
deavors bought them legitimacy and new friends. They 
became the envy of Waterdavian nobility in short order. 
Seemingly blessed, the Cassalanters attracted new fol-
lowers to their cult of devil worship, which was Asmode-
us's plan all along. 
Reneging on a contract with Asmodeus is a luxury 
no mortal can afford, but there is a way for Lord and 
Lady Cassalanter to save the souls ofTerenzio and El-
zerina. A clause in the contract allows them to preserve 
their remaining (and future) children's lives by instead 
paying ·'one shy of a million gold coins, and the sacri-
fice of one shy of one hundred unfortunate souls." The 
Cassalanters have most of the coin they need, but they 
require the gold from the Vault of Dragons to buy their 
children's salvation without bankrupting themselves. 
Victoro is in charge of locating the Vault of Dragons 
and securing the gold within it. Ammalia, for her part. 
plans to sacrifice ninety-nine souls in one fell swoop by 
throwing a feast on Founders' Day featuring poisoned 
food. Both the souls and the gold must be paid to As-
modeus at the same time. Foiling either one of these 
schemes spells doom for the Cassalanters' plot and their 
youngest children. 
CULT OF ASMODEUS 
Lord and Lady Cassalanter are the heads of a secre-
tive cult of Asmodeus. The cult convenes at midnight 
once every tenday in the temple of Asmodeus beneath 
Cassalanter Villa. During rituals of worship. members 
of the cult, including Lord and Lady Cassalanter, wear 
crimson robes, golden masks, and golden sacriflcial 
daggers. The masks and daggers are worth 75 gp each 
for the gold alone. 
MEET THE CASSALANTERS 
Each member of the Cassalanter family relaxes in differ-
ent parts 6f the house and reacts separately to the dis-
covery of characters intruding in their home. Lord and 
Lady Cassalanter are often out of the house on business. 
especially as Founders· Day draws near; they return 
home an hour before dinner.

LADY AMMALIA CASSALANTER 
Lady Cassalanter reacts with surprise to the sight of 
uninvited guests, but quickly conceals her feelings with 
a welcoming smile. She attempts to gain the intruders' 
confidence by pretending to believe that they are guests 
ofVictoro's and saying that she simply was not told of 
their presence. With this pretense established, she tries 
to learn the characters' true intentions, casting charm 
person on the party using a 5th-level spell slot (affecting 
up to five creatures within 30 feet) if necessary. Using 
magic in this way is illegal, but Ammalia has a lot of 
goodwill banked in Waterdeep- enough to curry favor 
with a magistrate. 
During the hours when Ammalia is home and awake. 
her location in the villa can be determined randomly:

Ammalia's Location 
01- 70 She's tending to her butterfly garden {area C25). 
71 - 90 She's smoking on the balcony (area C25a). 
91- 00 She's weeping before Osvaldo in the attic 
{area C24). 
LORD VrcTORO CASSALANTER 
Victoro Cassalanter reacts with fiery rage to the sight of 
uninvited guests. He demands to know their names and 
calls for the butler, Willifort Crowelle, to show them out. 
If he has the chance, he subtly casts dominate person 
on one of the characters using an 8th-level spell slot 
(extending its duration to 8 hours) to plant a spy among 
their ranks. As soon as the intruders are gone, he retires 
to his office (area C6) and uses his action to take total 
control of the dominated character. The dominated char-
acter reports to the City Watch that the party broke into 
Cassalanter Villa and must be arrested for their crime. 
During the hours when Victoro is home and awake, 
his location in the villa can be determined randomly: 
dl 00 
Victoro's Location 
01-70 He's in his office (area C6). 
71- 90 He's in the reading room (area C4). 
91- 00 He's with Ammalia at one of the three locations

(ASSALANTER LORE 
A successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check reveals 
the following information about CassalanterYilla and its 
inhabitants: 
• The Cassalanters fell on hard times a few years back, but 
they have since reversed their fortunes and restored their 
lucrative banking and money-lending business. 
• Victoro and Ammalia's eldest son disappeared three 
years ago when the family was on the verge of bank· 
ruptcy. They have two surviving children, young twins 
named Terenzio and Elzerina. 
• Lord Victoro Cassalanter is the only living heir of the late 
Caladorn Cassalanter, a former Masked Lord and a hero 
of the North. 
• Over the years, the Cassalanters have founded a number 
of philanthropic societies and made generous donations 
to temples dedicated to good-aligned deities. They are 
known to worship Siamorphe, a demigod whose ethos is 
the nobility's right and responsibility to rule. 
CllAPTER 6 I HELL OF A SUMMER 
T'ERENZIO AND ELZERINA 
The Cassalanter twins aren't members of their parents" 
cult and have no other friends. since they are privately 
tutored and rarely allowed to leave the estate. Around 
strangers, Terenzio becomes suspicious and meek. 
while Elzerina seems brash and outgoing. Both chil-
dren are incredibly excited to meet friendly strangers 
and treat their "new friends" to a trip around the house. 
They help the characters sneak through the villa, since 
the ch ildren know they aren't supposed to have guests. 
During the hours when the children are awake. their 
location in the villa can be determined randomly: 
dlOO 
01-50 
51- 75 
76-00 
Terenzio and Elzerina's Location 
They're playing in their room {area C18). 
They're in the library (area C3). 
They're chasing butterflies in the garden (area C25). 
Terenzio and Elzerina have places in the house that 
their parents have forbade them from visiting-and that 
they are excited to explore, now that they have friends to 
accompany them. These locations are as follows: 
• Their father's office (area C6) 
• The attic (area C24) 
• The wine cellar area (C28) 
If asked about their parents, Terenzio and Elzerina 
report that their parents are searching for some missing 
dragons. (What their parents plan to do with a bunch of 
scary, winged reptiles is beyond them, and Terenzio and 
Elzerina are too scared to ask.) If befriended, they reveal 
that their father keeps a journal in his office (area C6). 
If asked about their older brother, Osvaldo. Terenzio 
and Elzerina repeat what their parents have told them: 
he's attending school in a faraway city (they don't recall 
which one). Neither knows the cruel fate that has be-
fallen Osvaldo (see area C24) or suspects that a similar 
fate awaits them. 
HEAD SERVANTS 
The head servants of Cassalanter Villa are members of 
the cult. These four servants are described below. All 
appear to be tieflings, though one is not. The following 
changes apply to the tiefiings' stat blocks: 
• The tiefiings are lawful evil. 
• They have these racial traits: They know the thauma-
turgy cantrip, and Charisma is their spellcasting abil-
ity for this spell. They have resistance to fire damage. 
They have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. They 
speak Common and Infernal. 
WlLLIFORT CROWELLE 
Willi fort dresses in a sharp black suit and wears thin-
rimmed spectacles. He's a doppelganger that usually 
takes the form of an aging male tiefiing, and he greets 
all guests in the entrance hall (area Cl). 
As the Cassalanters' chief butler and Lord Victoro's 
personal attendant, Willifort Crowelle makes a point of 
knowing everything that transpires within the villa. If 
the Cassalanters have guests, he escorts them during 
their entire visit, using stealth if necessary. He ushers 
nosy guests away from areas or objects that might link 
the Cassalanters with the Asmodeus-worshiping cult.
