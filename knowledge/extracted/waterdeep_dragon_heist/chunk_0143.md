D URNAN 
Durnan is the owner and proprietor of the Yawning 
Portal. Although he looks like a middle-aged man whose 
best days are behind him, Durnan has a sharp mind 
and can still swing a sword when he must. He doesn't 
like talking about his past, and he won't reveal anything 
about his time as an adventurer. 
If Durnan has any living family members, he doesn't 
speak of them. He rarely says two words when one will 
do. He has a dark sense of humor and spares no pity on 
those who take the risk of entering Undermountain. 
He keeps Grimvault, his magic greatsword, within 
reach under the bar, and can chop tables in half with it if 
he so desires. He also can pull out a double crossbow (a 
heavy crossbow with reduced range that fires two bolts 
at the same target). Still, if he gets involved in a brawl, 
he prefers fighting with fists or a well-flung tankard. 
Durnan doesn't often venture far from the Yawning 
Portal, using his employees to run errands for him 
as needed. If he's feeling charitable, he might gently 
discourage likable "nobodies" from venturing into Un-
dermountain, if he thinks they wouldn't survive. He can 
also direct adventurers toward tavern regulars who 
might be able to help them or offer useful information. 
FLOON BLAGMAAR 
Floan, a native Waterdavian in his early thirties, is a 
handsome fellow but not very bright. He used to work 
as an escort in festhalls but is currently unemployed. 
Several months ago, he came upon a married noble en-
gaging in some indiscreet behavior, and now lives off the 
generous bribe he is being paid to keep silent. 
With friends all over the city, Floon spends most of 
his time drinking and carousing. He gets by on his 
looks and doesn't know what to do with his life, and has 
shown little interest in working for a living. 
GAME STATISTICS 
Floon is a chaotic good Illuskan human commoner with 
an Intelligence of 7 (-2) and a Charisma of 13 (+l). He 
speaks Common.
