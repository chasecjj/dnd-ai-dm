APPENDIX 1l I MONSTERS AND NPCS 
Victoro is a priest of Asmodeus, though his devotion 
to the Lord of the Nine Hells is a secret known only 
to his wife and his closest friends. Most Waterdavians 
know him as a successful banker, philanthropist, and 
worshiper of Lathander. Some of his business profits go 
toward feeding and sheltering the poor. But behind !his 
veneer of generosity, Victoro is a self-serving beast. 
The soul ofVictoro's eldest son, Osvaldo. is forever 
lost and can't be saved. To allay his guilt. Victoro has 
forged a plan to win back the souls of his young twins, 
Terenzio and Elzerina. Under the terms of the contract. 
their souls will be forfeit on their ninth birthdays, and 
that day is fast approaching. But Victoro can buy his way 
out of the obligation by providing, as the contract states, 
"'one shy of a million gold coins and the sacrifice of one 
shy of a hundred unfortunate souls." 
Victoro is well schooled, suave, slow to anger, and 
blessed with good health, long life, and immunity to dis-
ease. He dresses in the latest fashions and walks with a 
ruby-tipped cane, though not because he needs to. This 
cane has the magical properties of a rod of rulership. 
VOLOTHAM P GEDDA RM 
The bombastic world traveler Volothamp Geddarm 
is enjoying some downtime in Waterdeep following a 
successful book tour promoting his latest work, Volo:S 
Guide to Monsters. He spends most of his free time in 
the taproom of the Yawning Portal, reuniting with old 
friends and mulling over his next book project. 
Volo has an inflated opinion of himself and his impor-
tance in the world, but he's not without his charm. There 
is nothing he won't do to help a friend in need.
