accommodate a Small or Medium creature. The chair is 
situated before a panel of dials, levers, and buttons. Ter-
varound and Anverth stand by the back wall, monitoring 
gauges and performing system checks. A copper speak-
ing tube enables them to communicate with Breena 
Baffiestone in the engine room (area U2). 
The gnomes can pilot the Scarlet Marpenoth with-
out needing to make a check. Any other creature must 
succeed on a DC 20 Jntelligcnce check to figure out the 
controls. From the control panel, the pilot can detach 
the submarine from the Eyecatcher, as well as control 
its speed, direction, and depth. The pilot can electrify 
the outer hull for 1 minute, after which the system re-
quires 1 hour to recharge. Any creature that comes into 
contact with or starts its turn in contact with the outer 
hull when it's electrified must make a DC 15 Dexterity 
check, taking 22 {4dl0) lightning damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A 
creature wearing metal armor has disadvantage on this 
saving throw. 
U8. ENGINEERS' STATEROOMS 
Each of these four compartments contains an off-duty 
rock gnome engineer sleeping in a small hammock, 
beneath which are two steel footlockers. The four rock 
gnomes are named Cockaby Fapplestamp, Ellywick 
Fiddlefen, Gcrbo Reese, and Zaffrab Horcusporcus. 
Footlockers. Each footlocker belongs to a partic-
ular gnome engineer stationed aboard the Scarlet 
Marpenoth. Both contain folded clothes sized for a 
CH APTER 7 I MAESTRO'S FALL 
gnome. One of them also holds a set of grease-stained 
overalls and a set of tinker's tools that belong to the 
gnome asleep in the bunk. There is a 25 percent chance 
that a footlocker also contains a clockwork toy, a fire 
starter, or a music box (as described in the "Rock 
Gnome" section in chapter 2 of the Player's Handbook). 
U9. DIN !NG ROOM 
This room has the following features: 
• A walnut dining table is surrounded by eight padded 
swivel chairs. The height of each chair can be adjusted 
to accommodate a Small or Medium creature. 
• Soft, ambient music fills the room, created by magic. 
UlO. GALLEY 
This room has the following features: 
• An iron stove sits in one corner. 
In the opposite corner stands a steel food preparation 
table with utensils dangling above it. Built into the ta-
ble is a lidded steel box attached to a pedal on the floor 
below. When the pedal is pumped, water and moving 
brushes scrub dishes and utensils that have been 
placed into the box. 
A cart holds cutlery and dishes. 
Ull. PANTRY 
Metal shelves lining the walls hold fresh fruit, vegeta-
bles, casks of wine, and meat. Two steel barrels (one 
containing ale, the other drinking water) stand beneath 
the shelves.

U12. PRIVY 
This privy has a toilet and a washbasin, both attached to 
pipes. Above the basin is a hinged mirror, behind which 
is a compartment containing soap and towels. 
Ul3. AIR SYSTEM 
The door to this area is locked. A plaque on this door 
reads "AIR SYSTEM" in Common and Gnomish. The 
room has the following features: 
• The area is filled with machines that hiss, whir, and 
clatter constantly. 
• Drawers in the walls contain screwdrivers, wrenches, 
and other tools. 
To port and starboard, 3-foot-high, 2~-foot-wide pas-
sageways lead deeper into the machinery. Creatures 
that are Medium or larger must squeeze to move 
through these passages. 
Machinery. The quasi-magical machinery in this area 
generates and circulates fresh air throughout the sub-
marine. A detect magic spell or similar magic reveals an 
aura of conjuration magic throughout the area. 
A character who has proficiency with tinker's tools can 
use them to disable the machinery with a successful DC 
15 Intelligence check. The same check reactivates the 
disabled machinery. Whether it succeeds or fails, each 
check represents 10 minutes of work. The machinery 
can also be destroyed. It has AC 16, 50 hit points, and 
immunity to poison and psychic damage. 
When this machinery shuts down, air stops pumping 
throughout the vessel. Unless the air system is reacti-
vated, creatures trapped in the submarine that need oxy-
gen to breathe will begin to suffocate after two days (see 
"Suffocating" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). 
SPECIAL EVENTS 
You can use one or more of the following events if the 
characters take an interest in the Sea Maidens Faire. 
THE FRIENDLY D RAGON 
This encounter can be used as the characters approach 
the Eyecatcher. Read: 
In the water ahead, a large shape speeds toward you. 
As it gets closer, you recognize it as a dragon with 
bronze-colored scales. Slewing to a stop, the creature 
gives a toothy grin, then raises a claw in a small wave. 
"Well met!" it chirps. 
Zelifarn, a young bronze dragon, recently moved 
into Deepwater Harbor. He has spent the past several 
months scouring wrecks at the bottom of the harbor 
for treasure and stashing precious baubles in a hidden 
underwater cave. Recently, he noticed a strange craft 
mounted on the underside of the Eyecatcher. His at-
tempts to treat with the crew have met with no success, 
but he's curious to know more. Since the characters 
appear to be headed toward a rendezvous with the Eye-
catcher, Zelifarn would like them to find out all they can 
about the underwater vessel without raising suspicion. 
The dragon promises to meet them again after they have 
completed their mission. In exchange for information, 
he offers to give the party a barnacle-covered chest that 
he found recently. He hasn't opened it yet, so its contents 
are unknown to him, but he can smell gold inside. 
TREASURE 
Zelifarn approaches the characters again as they leave 
the Eyecatcher. If they tell him more about the contents 
of the submarine and he believes that they're being 
truthful, he gives them the promised reward: an old 
chest with a rusted lock that can be busted or pried open 
with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. It 
contains 300 sp plus a golden amulet shaped like an oc-
topus with amethyst eyes (worth 250 gp). 
A secret compartment in the chest's lid can be found 
with a successful DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
1t contains a stoppered wooden scroll tube that holds a 
spell scroll of revivify. 
A NIGHT TO REMEMBER 
If the characters stake out the ships of the Sea Maidens 
Faire, they observe strange activity on the pier during 
their first night of surveillance: 
A thick fog unexpectedly rises along the water, engulfing 
vessels and docks alike. As the gray miasma thickens, the 
creaking sound of shifting ships becomes increasingly 
haunting. Suddenly, you spot three shadows gliding 
through the gloom like elves slipping through a forest. 
Where they came from and where they're going, you 
don't know. 
The shadowy figures are the three drow gunslingers 
Fel'rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg Masq'il'yr, and Soluun Xibrin-
das (see appendix B). If any of these drow are dead or 
otherwise indisposed, replace them with drow elite 
warriors. The drow used the cover of the fog to come 
ashore in one of the Eyecatcher's rowboats. The boat is 
tied off at the end of the pier between the Heartbreaker 
and the Hell raiser. 
These Bregan D'aerthe spies are on their way to a 
secret meeting with Laeral Silverhand (see appendix 
B). The Open Lord is waiting for them in an alley in the 
Dock Ward, under the cloak of an invisibility spell. She 
remains invisible for the entire meeting. 
Harper spies in Luskan recently warned Laeral that 
jarlaxle might be in Waterdeep. She reached out to him 
with a sendina spell to arrange this meeting, in the hope 
of finding out his plans. The characters can follow the 
drow spies to the rendezvous. If the drow realize they're 
being followed, they make no effort to shake their pursu-
ers. If they're attacked, they scatter and try to complete 
their mission before heading back to the Eyecatcher. 
lf a battle erupts and escape appears impossible, the 
drow fight to the death. A City Watch patrol consisting of 
six veterans arrives ld4 minutes later to make arrests.
