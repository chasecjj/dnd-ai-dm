HLAM 
This venerable human monk lives in a cave halfway up 
the side of Mount Waterdeep. Hlam is the grand mas-
ter of the Order of the Even-Handed, a small monastic 
group devoted to Tyr. Would-be students periodically 
visit him to learn the Way of the Sacred Fists, which 
combines cleric magic and monk training. They usually 
return to the city confused, bruised, and not inclined to 
visit again. 
In times of great peril, Hlam can be called on to help. 
Sometimes he offers pearls of wisdom, and sometimes 
he descends from his cave to set things right with fist-
icuffs. He can show up at any point in the story as a 
helpful figure, and the characters can visit him in his 
cave if they need guidance or training. The Order of the 
Gauntlet considers him a staunch ally. 
Hlam is immune to disease and doesn't require food 
or water. Although he ages, he suffers none of the frailty 
of old age.
