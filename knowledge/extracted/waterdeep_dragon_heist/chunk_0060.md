B3. SECRET D OORS 
Secret doors blend with the surrounding stonework on 
opposite sides of this sewer tunnel. One door opens into 
area B7, the other into area BIO. Characters who have 
a passive Perception score of 15 or higher spot both 
secret doors as they pass by. Otherwise, finding a secret 
door requires a search of the wall and a successful DC 
15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The secret doors are set 
high enough that opening them doesn't cause sewage to 
flow into adjoining areas. 
B4. RUST Y IRON D OOR 
A door made of rusted iron is set into the wall above a 
dry, I-foot-wide stone ledge. The door's lock corroded 
long ago, and the door squeals loudly on rusty hinges 
when opened. 
B5. ARROW SLITS 
A brick wall with arrow slits was added to this room at 
some point. The arrow slits are designed to allow ar-
chers to fire at intruders who come through the door at 
area B4. The arrow slits provide three-quarters cover. 
B6. STORAGE R OOM 
An unlocked wooden door closes off this empty room. 
B7. R UBBLE-FILLED CELLAR 
A wa ll has collapsed, creating a larger space out of two 
smaller rooms. The air is heavy with dust, and the floor 
is strewn with rubble, refuse, and rat droppings. 
Secret Door. The secret door to area B3 is easily 
spotted from this side (no check required). 
CHAPTER 4 I DRAGON SEASON 
1 square = 5 feet 
B8. SUNKEN CELLAR 
This sunken cellar has these features: 
• An unlocked iron door is set into the east wall. 
• A crumbling stone staircase against the south wall 
climbs up to a landing, where a wooden door is held 
shut with a chain and a padlock. 
Iron Door. The door opens into a small, empty stor-
age room with hooks hanging from the ceiling. 
Stairs Up. The lock can be picked with a successful 
DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools, or 
the door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 
Strength (Athletics) check. It opens into an alley behind 
a boarded-up tenement. 
B9. RAT-I NFESTED CELLAR 
These rooms are situated below a hostel (75 percent 
chance) or an orphanage (25 percent chance). Harmless 
rats crawl about, minding their own business. 
B9a. Stone stairs climb 10 feet to a wooden door that 
opens into a street or alley. Crates and barrels stacked at 
the bottom of the stairs hold edible foodstuffs, but noth-
ing else of value. 
B9b. A plain wooden door opens into a room contain-
ing dusty furnishings in storage. The furniture includes 
a scratched wooden desk, several wobbly chairs, a coat 
rack, two small tables, and an empty wooden trunk. 
There's a 25 percent chance that one piece of furniture 
(determined randomly) is a mimic that usually feeds on 
rats but never passes up a bigger meal.

BIO. OLD TAVERN CELLAR 
This spacious, empty cellar has the following features: 
• Stone pillars and arches support the ceiling. 
• Mismatched stonework on either side of a half-demol-
ished wall indicates that this area was once two sepa-
rate chambers. 
Stone stairs climb to a bricked-up doorway. (The door 
once led to an alley behind an old tavern.) 
Secret Door. The secret door to area B3 is easily 
spotted from this side (no check required). 
Bll. BACK CELLARS 
These rooms are extensions of area BlO. 
Blla. This room used to be a wine cellar. Its walls are 
lined with piles of rotting wood (storage racks) and bro-
ken bottles. 
Bllb. Once a cold storage room and root cellar, this 
empty chamber is choked with dust and cobwebs. 
CELLAR COMPLEX: SPRING ---
The characters have learned that a haltling necroman-
cer named Losser MirkJav took the Stone ofGo/orr. He 
lives in a cellar complex under a powdered wig shop 
in the Trades Ward. The shop, Dandymops, is closed 
and locked with an iron gate. The lock can be picked by 
a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity 
check using thieves' tools, or the gate can be forced 
open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) 
check. Since the shop is in a highly visible location, an 
attempt to break into it is 75 percent likely to be noticed 
by someone who alerts the City Watch. Two veterans of 
the City Watch arrive in ldlO minutes to investigate the 
shop and talk to witnesses. 
Xanathar's gazer (see appendix B) doesn't follow 
characters into the shop. It remains outside and waits 
for Xanathar Guild forces to arrive. If the characters 
destroyed the gazer in an earlier encounter, another one 
arrives with the Xanathar Guild forces. 
DUNGEON ENTRANCE 
Area 81 is the basement of the wig shop and the charac-
ters' point of entry into the cellar complex. 
MISTY SEWERS 
The dense fog from outside settles in the sewers, and 
areas 82, B3, and 84 are lightly obscured. 
NECROMANCER 
Losser Mirklav is a lightfoot halfiing mage, with 
these changes: 
• He is chaotic evil and has 31 (9d6) hit points. 
• He has these racial traits: He is Small, and his walk-
ing speed is 25 feet. He can move through the space 
of a Medium or larger creature. He has advantage on 
saving throws against being frightened. He speaks 
Common and Haltling. 
• He has the animate dead and blight spells prepared, 
instead of counterspell and greater invisibility. All his 
spell slots are currently expended. 
Losser carries a spellbook bound in stitched flesh that 
contains all his prepared spells. He also has a key to 
the padlocked door in area BB and 4dl0 gp in a pouch 
made of elf skin and cinched with a rope made of woven 
dwarf hair. 
Losser has made several changes to the complex: 
• Area B6 contains three beds-two sized for Losser's 
human apprentices and a smaller bed sized for him. 
• Area 810 contains twelve skeletons that attack any-
one other than Losser and his apprentices. 
• Area Bl l contains piles of human bones stolen from 
the City of the Dead. Losser hasn't gotten around to 
animating them yet. 
WHERE'S THE STONE? 
Before the characters reach Losser, kenku members of 
the Xanathar Guild break down the door leading into 
the cellar complex via area BB and confront the necro-
mancer. The characters find Losser cowering in one 
corner of area 87. Two skeletons stand between him 
and three kenku. The kenku aim to kill the halfling. 
Lying on the floor around them are four dead kenku and 
the remains of two destroyed (and previously animated) 
skeletons. 
If the characters demand the Stone ofGo/orr, Losser 
tells them the truth: he surrendered it to the keoku, two 
of which fled south with it. In area BB. the characters 
see one kenku standing over the bodies ofLosser's 
murdered human apprentices, Retchyo and Kreela. This 
kenku is joined by Xanathar's gazer (see appendix 8). 
The kenku and the gazer try to hold off the characters 
for as long as possible, buying time for a second kenku 
to flee with the Stone ofGolorr. 
If the characters pursue the stone and leave Losser 
alive, he eventually slips away and retreats to area 811. 
NEXT ENCOUNTER 
Once the characters defeat Xanathar's forces in the cel-
lar, they can chase after the fleeing kenku that has the 
Stone ofGo/orr in its clutches. Proceed with encounter 
3, "Street Chase." 
CELLAR COMPLEX: SUMMER 
The characters are hot on the trail of three street ur-
chins as the children scamper into the sewers under the 
Dock Ward. 
SICKENING SMELL 
The summer heat makes the sewer smell worse than 
usual, and characters become poisoned by the stench 
unless they cover their noses with perfumed scarves. 
The effect lasts until they leave the sewers. The street 
urchins and other creatures that live in the sewers are 
accustomed to the smell and aren't poisoned in this way. 
SEARCH FOR THE URCHINS 
The characters approach the cellar complex from the 
east, eventually coming upon an iron door in the side of 
the sewer tunnel (area B4). 
The street urchins took the Stone ofGolorr to area 
87 {which serves as their clubhouse). entering the room 
through a secret door (area 83). The eldest child. Nat, 
attuned to the stone, but contact with the aboleth so ter-
rified her that she dropped it, screamed, and ran away.
