THE BLACK VIPER 
The Black Viper was a notorious burglar, pickpocket, 
mugger, and assassin who died a century ago, after 
a long and nefarious career. Esvele Rosznar, a brash 
young noble, has recently adopted the Black Viper's 
persona to lead a secret life of crime. Like many other 
nobles, Esvele gossips about the Black Viper's exploits 
to lend credence to the villain's mystique. 
The Rosznar family was convicted of slave trading-
highly illegal in Waterdeep and banished over a hun-
dred years ago, but has since returned. The Rosznars' 
inability to regain the respect they feel they deserve 
rankles them. The slave trade has continued in Arnn 
and elsewhere, and it's not like other noble houses don·t 
have skeletons in their closets. But just because of a lit-
tle family squabble that went public, the Rosznar name 
has been said with a sneer for a century. As part of the 
family's constant effort to prove this conception wrong 
and win others' respect, Esvele has been brought up 
to be the most proper noble possible, partaking in les-
sons of etiquette, dance, and poise as befits someone of 
her station. 
In her younger days, Esvele openly rebelled, but that 
behavior led to locked doors at night and house guards

watching her every move during the day. So she taught 
herself how to pick locks, pluck keys from belts and 
pouches, clamber up walls. and sneak past guards-
playing the perfect daughter by day while cutting loose 
at night. To hide her identity from those she met. she 
wore a hood and mask. exchanging her fine clothes for 
the kind of practical clothing her parents would never 
let her wear. 
One of the things Esvele has learned is to embrace 
the legend of the Black Viper. When she throws back 
her cloak to reveal the costume she has put together, 
most folk toss their purses and flee. If that doesn't work, 
she usually needs only to draw her dagger. Of course, 
some of the nobles she targets are made of sterner stuff, 
so Esvele has learned how to fight as well. She knows 
she's playing a dangerous game, but is satisfied that at 
least one member of the Rosznar family is earning the 
respect of Waterdeep's nobility.
