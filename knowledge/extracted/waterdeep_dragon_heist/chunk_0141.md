lSTRfD HORN 
lstrid is regarded as the Black Network's Master of 
Trade and Coin in Waterdeep. The shield dwarf oper-
ates an illegal lending operation out of a heavily guarded 
warehouse in the Dock Ward. offering loans to those in 
need of coin. Her interest rates are comparable to those 
of her competitors {including noble families of bankers 
such as the Cassalanters and the Irlingstars), but the 
penalties for not paying back lstrid's loans are severe. 
lstrid worships Vergadain, the dwarven god of wealth 
and luck. She likes having others indebted to her, and 
she employs thugs and enforcers to collect on her loans. 
Jf those resources prove inadequate, Istrid can call on 
her old adventuring companions for assistance.

crafts magical ones for his Zhent friends.

vices having been bought by House Gralhund and tbe 
Black Network operatives loyal to Mansboon. The rock 
gnome uses paper birds (see appendix A) to send mes-
sages both to his new friends and his old ones.
