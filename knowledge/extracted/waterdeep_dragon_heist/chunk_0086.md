C21. MASTER BEDROOM 
The door to this room is locked. The room contains the 
following noteworthy features: 
The walls are adorned with nine friezes, each one de· 
picting a layer of the ine Hells. 
A four-poster bed draped in deep red curtains and 
tipped with gold spires stands before an ornate door 
carved from dark hardwood with a gold latch. (This 
door is locked and leads to area C22.) 
A search of the room reveals a golden lockbox tucked 
under the bed. 
Golden Lockbox. Both Victoro and Ammalia keep 
their cult regalia (see "Cult of Asmodeus," page ll5) in 
a solid gold lockbox (worth 750 gp) hidden under their 
bed. The box can be unlocked with either Victoro's or 
Ammalia's golden key, or by a character who makes a 
successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. 
It can also be pried open with a successful DC 16 
Strength (Athletics) check. 
If the box is opened by any means other than a golden 
key. poison gas sprays out from holes in the underside 
of the lid, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on 
the box. This trap can't be disarmed. Any creature in 
its area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, 
taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. The gas dissi-
pates quickly. 
C22. AMMALIA
1S PRIVATE STUDY 
The door to this room is locked. The room contains the 
following features: 
• The walls are lined with bookshelves packed with 
thick tomes. 
• A grimoire with a red leather cover sits on a desk 
carved from dark oak. 
• A ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling. 
Bookshelves. The books on the shelves include works 
of fiction and nonfiction. 
Desk. Aside from the grimoire (described below), the 
desk holds an ornate golden candlestick (worth 125 gp), 
a golden inkwell (worth 25 gp), and a feathered quill 
pen (worth 15 gp). The desk drawer contains a wax seal 
bearing the Cassalanter crest, Ammalia Cassalanter's 
spellbook (which contains all the spells she has pre-
pared), and ten vials of jet-black poison known as mid-
night tears (see "Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon 
Master's Guide). Ammalia plans to taint the Founders' 
Day feast with the poison (see "Special Events"). 
Red Grimoire. The tome on the desk, bound in crim-
son leather, details a diabolical ritual that Ammalia and 
Victoro enacted to first contact the archdevil Asmodeus. 
Opening it reveals nothing but blank pages with a few 
drops of dry blood on them. If a drop of humanoid 
blood is spilled on any page, lnfernal text on that page 
becomes legible, remaining so until the book is closed. 
The blood remains even after the text vanishes. 
CHAPTER 6 I HELL OF A SUMMER

Any character with the Ritual Casting feature (or the 
Ritual Caster feat) who spends 24 hours reading the 
book can master the ritual described within. The ritual 
takes 11 minutes to cast and requires incense and a vial 
of unholy water (which are consumed during the perfor-
mance of the ritual). At the end of the ritual, a proxy of 
Asmodeus appears and grants its summoner the benefit 
of a commune spell. The proxy is formed of incense 
smoke and resembles a pit fiend. A character must finish 
a long rest before performing the ritual again. 
Trapdoor. The trapdoor in the ceiling is the entrance 
to the attic. 
C23. ATTIC LANDING 
A thick scent of sulfur pervades the attic. The only illu-
mination is a beam of light that shines feebly through a 
shuttered window at the west end of the room. 
This attic is soundproof as long as no doors are open. 
Osvaldo's howling can be heard outside the attic only if 
the trapdoor between this room and area C22 and the 
door between this room and area C24 are both open at 
the same time. Additionally. creatures that have telep-
athy can't communicate telepathically with creatures 
outside the attic unless the doors are open. 
Terenzio and Elzerina have heard howling coming 
from the attic two or three times in their lives and are 
curious about what lurks there. 
C24. O SVALDO'S PRISON 
If Ammalia Cassalanter or Victoro Cassalanter (see 
appendix B) or both are present, the door to this room 
<.:HAl'TER GI HELL Of A SUMMER 
is unlocked but closed. Otherwise, it's locked shut. and 
Victoro and Ammalia carry the only keys. When the 
characters first open the door, read: 
1 
You are greeted with a wave of incoherent howling, as if 
opening the door broke down a dam that had been hold-
ing back a madman's screams. 
l 
Osvaldo Cassalanter (see appendix B) shrieks and 
moans at all hours of the day. He is trying desperately to 
get someone to hear him and come to his rescue. If one 
or both of his parents are here, he spits curses at them 
as they weep before him. 
Guarding the room are two imps in spider form. They 
answer to Lord Cassalanter, and their job is to kill birds, 
rats, and other vermin that find their way into the attic. 
They attack anyone who tries to free Osvaldo or threat-
ens other family members present. 
The Cassalanter heir apparent is a soulless abomina· 
lion thanks to his parents' thoughtless greed. His empty 
shell of a body has been transformed into a chain devil 
that his parents have imprisoned using his own chains. 
A 10-foot-diameter pentagram has been burned into the 
floor around him. A detect magic spell reveals a power-
ful aura of abjuration magic emanating from the symbol. 
Osvaldo's chains are wrapped around the beams 
and timbers that frame the room. He can't damage the 
house, nor can he break his own chains. He can only
