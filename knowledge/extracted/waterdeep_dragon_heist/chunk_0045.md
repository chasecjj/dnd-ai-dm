MAP 4.2: MtSTSHORE 
Xanathar has learned where he is being kept. Any bug-
bears that survived the initial attack try to rescue Ott, 
while Avareen and Zorbog do their best to fight them off. 
If Ott is set free, he runs back to the waiting eyestalks of 
his insane beholder master. Characters who follow him 
are led straight to Xanathar's lair (see chapter 5). 
NEXT ENCOUNTER 
Any characters within 10 feet of the Zhents' front door 
can make a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check. Those 
who succeed on the check hear a mocking laugh above 
the howling wind and glimpse a cloaked figure on a 
nearby roof, darting away through the blizzard. If the 
characters chase after this figure, proceed with encoun-
ter 5, "Rooftop Chase." 
ENCOUNTER 2: MISTSHORE 
Mistshore is a run-down Dock Ward neighborhood 
that reeks of fish and scorched timber. A fire swept 
through the area a little over a year ago, and most of 
the buildings are now burned-out shells with (at best) 
sails for roofs. Fishing poles and nets line the dock, and 
the 15-foot-deep water is covered by a thick layer of ice 
during the winter. 
AREAS OF MISTSHORE 
Mistshore is a riotous assemblage of ramshackle homes 
made of wood from old ships and inhabited by impov-
erished Waterdavians. Several buildings were reduced 
1 square = 5 feet 
to ash by the fire last year. Although some were rebuilt, 
others were ruined beyond repair and are now used as 
roofless dens by homeless children and rats. 
The following locations are keyed to map 4.2. 
Dl. KRAKEN'S FOLLY 
The Kraken's Folly is a beached pirate ship that some 
residents of Mistshore use as a tenement. At any given 
time, 4d6 bandits loiter on deck, hoping that someone 
who needs muscle will offer them work. These ruffians 
live in the rat-infested cabins belowdecks. They are will-
ing to come to the aid of anyone who asks- for a price. 
Each demands 1 gp to get involved in a fight or create a 
distraction on behalf of their employer. 
D2. GRINDA'S RESIDENCE 
A mad treasure hunter named Grinda Garloth (CN 
female Illuskan human mage who speaks Common, 
Dwarvish, Halfting, and Undercommon) lives here. Her 
ramshackle home contains an unmade bed, an alche-
mist's laboratory, a small stove, a coat rack, a table, a 
stool, a stuffed chair in poor condition, a wash basin, 
and a locked wooden sea chest with a glyph of warding 
spell cast on it. Grinda carries the key, and the glyph 
triggers an explosive runes effect (see the spell descrip-
tion in the Player's Handbook) if anyone other than 
Grinda lifts the lid of the chest. 
Chest. Grinda's chest contains a heavy iron key that 
locks and unlocks the Garloth family mausoleum in the 
City of the Dead (see "Mistshore: Spring" below).

03. GRINDA'S APPARATUS 
Grinda Garloth keeps her apparatus of Kwalish here 
when she's not using the vehicle to hunt for treasure in 
Deepwater Harbor. While the apparatus is here, it ftoats 
in an enclosed dock. Underwater metal doors leading 
out to the harbor are kept shut by an iron bar across the 
inside. The apparatus can lift the iron bar automatically; 
a creature inside the bay can lift it with a successful DC 
20 Strength (Athletics) check. 
Borrowing the Apparatus. Crinda allows the char-
acters to borrow her apparatus of Kwalisi1 on the condi-
tion that they first use the device to search the bottom 
of Deepwater Harbor for treasure and give her half of 
whatever they find. To meet the mage's demands. the 
characters must spend a day searching the harbor. At 
the end of the day, the pilot makes an Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check. Multiply the total of the check by 10 
to determine the gold piece value of any treasure found. 
Crinda sells the bounty and gives half to the characters. 
As lhe characters search the harbor for treasure, roll 
any die. If an even number is rolled, an awakened shark 
named Obliteros attacks them. Grinda has had several 
close encounters with the shark recently. but fails to 
mention this to the characters for fear of scaring them 
off. Obliteros is a giant shark, with these changes: 
• The shark's alignment is chaotic evil. 
• Its Intelligence score is 10 (+0), and it can speak and 
understand Aquan. 
C H APTER 4 I DRAGON SEASON 
MISTSH ORE: S PRI NG 
Xanathar has sent forces to collect the Stone ofGolorr 
from Grinda Garloth, known up and down the wharf as 
an eccentric wizard who owns a submersible contrap-
tion that she uses to hunt for treasure on the bottom of 
Deepwater Harbor. The characters have no trouble get-
ting directions to her Mistshore residence (area 02). 
When the characters arrive at her home, Grinda is 
holed up inside, having barricaded the doors with furni-
ture. Trying to break down the doors are four members 
of the Xanathar GuiJd (CE male human bandits) under 
the command of a dwarf enforcer named Noska Ur'gray 
(see appendix B). A merrow also under Noska's com-
mand swims beneath the docks. It surfaces to attack 
when the characters arrive. 
If the characters come to Grinda's defense. Noska 
orders his thugs to attack them while he takes potshots 
at the characters with his crossbow. Two rounds later, 
eight more bandits leap down from the Kraken's Folly 
(area DJ) and join the fray. These hooligans were paid 1 
gp each to watch Noska's back. The characters can turn 
them against Noska by offering a larger bribe (at least 
5 gp each). 
If the characters turn the hooligans against oska or 
reduce the dwarf to half his hit points or fewer. Noska 
flees. Any remaining Xanathar Guild members cover his 
escape. Grinda emerges from her residence to thank the 
characters once the fight has concluded.
