A character with thieves' tools can pick the lock on a 
door or the window with a successful DC 10 Dexterity 
check. Characters who enter quietly can try to catch the 
kenku by surprise. If the characters knock before en-
tering or announce their arrival in some other way, the 
kenku hide as described above. 
Tables and chairs have been carelessly tossed across the 
floor. The corpses of a dozen men lie along the walls, 
their rapiers and daggers lying nearby. On the north side 
of the area, stairs rise to an open level above. 
If the kenku aren't hidden, add: 
Four short, avian creatures with long beaks and black 
feathers look over in surprise from where they stand in 
the middle of the warehouse. Each wears a hooded cloak 
and wields a shortsword. 
The corpses belong to five human Zhentarim sellswords 
(the same ones who kidnapped Floon and Renaer) and 
seven human Xanathar Guild thugs, all of them clad in 
leather armor. Each Zhent has a black tattoo of a winged 
snake on his neck or forearm, and one of the Xanathar 
Guild members has a black tattoo on the palm of his 
right hand that looks like a circle with ten spokes radiat-
ing out from its circumference (the symbol of Xanathar). 
The kenku fight until two of them are incapacitated or 
killed, whereupon the survivors try to nee. A successful 
DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check forces captured 
kenku to divulge what they know. 
WHAT THE KEN KU KNOW 
When kenku speak, they mimic sounds and voices they 
have heard before. Under interrogation, they repeat the 
following phrases: 
In a deep voice with an orcish accent: "Xanathar 
sends its regards.,. 
• In a thin, nasally voice: "Tie up the pretty boy in the 
back room!" and "Follow the yellow signs in the sew-
ers." (This remark refers to tunnels in the sewers that 
are marked with Xanathar's symbol where they lead 
to the Xanathar Guild hideout.) 
• In a scratchy voice: "No time to loot the place.just get 
him to the boss." 
Z2. STORAGE CLOSET 
The door to this back room hangs loosely on broken 
hinges. The cramped chamber beyond smells strongly 
of sour fish and vinegar. It is filled with discarded ropes. 
canvas tarpaulins, and splintered wood from smashed 
barrels. Renaer Neverember (see appendix B) is hjding 
here, having slipped free of his rope bonds. The charac-
ters can hear his ragged breathing coming from under a 
tarpaulin at the north end of the room. 
ROLEPLAYING RENAER 
Renaer is unarmed. Marred by grime and the lingering 
stench of rancid pickled herring, he speaks with grace 
and articulation, as befits his noble upbringing. His trust 
is easily gained but impossible to restore once broken.

On the night of the abduction, Renaer was concerned 
that Floon was too intoxicated to find his way home by 
himself and offered to escort him. The two were jumped 
by five thugs as they left Fillet Lane and headed north on 
Zastrow Street. 
Renaer feels guilty that Floon was taken, since he be-
lieves (correctly) that they mistook Floon for him. If the 
characters ask Renaer to join their search for Floon, he 
agrees to do so, arming himself with a dagger and a ra-
pier scavenged from the dead Zhents in the warehouse. 
If a character asks Renaer why the Zhents kidnapped 
him, he gives the following truthful reply: 
"The Zhentarim thinks that my father embezzled a large 
amount of gold while he was Open Lord, and that he 
hid the dragons somewhere in the city. They think they 
can find it by using an artifact called the Stone of Colorr, 
which was in the hands of the Xanathar Guild until re· 
cently. Apparently, someone stole it. The Zhents thought 
I knew something about all of this, but I don't. My father 
and I haven't spoken in years." 
Z3. SECRET ROOM 
This room is hidden behind a secret door that can be 
found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. When the secret door is opened, the characters 
can hear the faint sound of a bell ringing in the offices 
above them (area ZS).

The Zhents have stashed two wooden crates here. The 
first, stolen from the docks, contains four wood-framed 
paintings wrapped in leather. The paintings depict 
the cities of Luskan, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, and 
Baldur's Gate and are worth 75 gp each. 
The second crate, stolen from a caravan on the High 
Road, contains fifteen 10-pound silver trade bars, all 
black from corrosion but still worth 50 gp each. 
Z4. BALCONY 
The open second level is stacked with crates where it 
overlooks the main warehouse. Characters who search 
through the crates find all sorts of junk, including moth-
eaten bolts of cloth, bottles of spoiled olive oil, and hun-
dreds of pairs of wooden-soled sandals that were all the 
rage last summer but are now out of fashion. None of 
this junk is valuable. 
Z5. O FFICES 
The upper floor contains a suite of offices that get little 
use by the Zhents. The rooms have desks, chairs, and 
bare shelves covered with dust and draped in cobwebs. 
Harmless rats skitter about. 
Mounted above each office door is a steel alarm bell. 
The bells are connected by wires to the secret door in 
area 23, and they ring loudly when that door is opened. 
TREASURE 
A character who searches the offices finds an unused 
paper bird (see appendix A).
