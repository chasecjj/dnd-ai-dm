Dancing Construct. The dressed "mannequin" is a 
magical construct that serves as a dance partner. It has 
the statistics of a nimblewright (see appendix B) but 
has no effective attacks and is worth 0 XP. When a hu-
manoid bows or curtsies before the construct. it makes 
the other gesture while a magic mouth spell plays a re-
corded message in Common: "Which dance would you 
like? Galliard? Pavane? Waltz?'" The construct follows 
its partner's lead until the dance ends. when it becomes 
still again. 
Founders' Day. During the party, dozens of wealthy 
masked guests dance lo a lively waltz played by a 
string quartet.

pies for the noble guests. 
C l5. BANQUET H ALL 
The only piece of furniture in this expansive hall is a 
long wooden dining table that happens to be a giant 
mimic in disguise. It has the statistics of a normal 
mimic, with these changes:

• As an action, it can make three attacks: two with its 
pseudopods and one with its bite. 
• It has a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP). 
The mimic is well treated by the Cassalanters and 
won't harm any member of the household. It obeys only 
Lord and Lady Cassalanter. 
Founders' Day. The room is outfitted with dozens of 
chairs, and the table is filled with food. Two dozen party 
guests are gorging themselves here at any time. Four 
doppelgangers from the Yawning Portal have slipped 
into the party disguised as nobles. Their leader, Bonnie 
(see "Familiar Paces," page 20), poses as a minor 
noblewoman going by the name Lymeria Lhaurilstar; 
she was hoping lo have a fun night al the party, but she's 
willing to help the characters if they need aid.

check using thieves' tools. It can also be pried open with 
a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check.
