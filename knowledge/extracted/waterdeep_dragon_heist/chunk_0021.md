these spies are paying particular attention to the activi-
ties of the drow party members. 
JA RLAXLE B AENRE 
If the party reports the drow to the City Watch,Jarlaxle 
ends the surveillance and breaks off all contact with the 
characters for the time being. 
On the other hand, if the characters try to confront 
the drow spies, they avoid contact but leave behind a 
black eye patch as a calling card. The next day,Jarlaxle 
Baenre (see appendix B) shows up at the party's 
headquarters, using his hat of disguise to appear as a 
haberdasher named J.B. Nevercott. In this guise, he 
asks to speak privately with drow characters who he 
thinks might make suitable Brcgan D'aerthe recruits. 
Only drow are given serious consideration, butjarlaxle 
doesn't care if they're male or female. As a test, he offers 
them their first mission. 
Jarlaxle is a consummate actor who never lets down 
his guard. Even if the characters discern his true iden-
tity, he never admits to being anything other than what 
he pretends to be.

Mission Brief 
"Outlying farms are being terrorized by a 
scarecrow come to life. It has slaughtered live· 
stock, chased horses, and spooked farmers. 
No people have been killed as yet, so the City 
Guard is dragging its heels. Something must 
be done!" 
"Sir Ambrose Everdawn, a grizzled old cham-
pion of Kelemvor, has offered to help the City 
Guard catch a necromancer who's stealing 
bones from the City of the Dead and animating 
them as skeletons. Sir Ambrose could use your 
help, if you're not too busy." 
"Doppelgangers threaten the balance of power 
in Waterdeep. Rumor has it a group of them 
are hiding in the Yawning Portal. Root them 
out and rid the city of them if you can." 
"The Xanathar Guild is releasing monsters 
to distract the City Watch and the City Guard 
while its members stir up trouble elsewhere. 
The authorities are having trouble catching 
and killing a flying horror known as a grell. 
This aberration was latest seen snatching up 
an old woman in the Dock Ward. Unless we 
intervene, she won't be the last." 
EMERALD ENCLAVE 
The Emerald Enclave takes an interest in characters 
who seek to preserve the balance within Waterdeep 
(particularly clerics of nature, druids, and rangers). Any 
such character is visited by a white cat that speaks the 
following message in a melodious male voice: 
! 
"Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet I 
us at Phaulkonmere in the Southern Ward." 
The cat is an ordinary animal upon which an animal 
messenger spell was cast. h dashes away after deliver-
ing its invitation. 
M E LA NNOR F ELLBRANCH 
The characters' main contact in the Emerald Enclave 
is Melannor Fellbranch, the friendly but humorless 
groundskeeper of Phaulkonmere, a compound located 
one block south of Kolat Towers (see chapter 8). Phaul-
konmere is owned by the Tarm and Phaulkon noble 
families. Melannor delivers missions by way of animal 
messenger spells and is partial to using cats and pi-
geons as couriers. He quickly assigns new members 
their first mission. 
Mission Requirements and Reward 
Not one but three scarecrows are terrorizing Undercliff. One wears 
a sackcloth hood, another has a rotting pumpkin head, and the 
third is covered with a threadbare blanket. Characters who camp in 
a field for the better part of a day or night have a 10 percent chance 
of encountering one of the scarecrows. The attacks continue until 
all three scarecrows are destroyed. Reward: Each Emerald Enclave 
character gains l renown for ending the threat. 
Convincing Ambrose Everdawn (LG male human Tethyrian knight) 
that the party intends to help requires a successful DC 13 Charisma 
(Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, Sir Ambrose asks the 
party to patrol the southern half of the cemetery for ten consecutive 
nights while he patrols the north half. The characters have a cumu· 
lative 10 percent chance each night of encountering six skeletons, 
but there's no sign of the necromancer who animated them. Once 
the skeletons are destroyed, no further encounters occur. After a 
tenday, Sir Ambrose releases the characters from service. Reward: 
Each Emerald Enclave character gains 1 renown. Each party mem-
ber who patrolled the cemetery for all ten nights receives 100 gp. 
The characters need to confront "Bonnie" the doppelganger and, 
with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) 
check, convince her to leave Waterdeep and take her gang with her. 
Reward: Each Emerald Enclave character gains 2 renown. 
Locating the grell requires a successful DC 18 Intelligence (lnves· 
tigation) check followed by a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Survival) 
check. Each check, whether successful or not, represents l hour of 
gathering information or tracking spoor. In fact, there are two grells. 
One grell tries to flee if the other is killed. Reward: Each Emerald 
Enclave character gains 2 renown. )eryth bestows a charm of hero· 
ism (see "Supernatural Gifts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's 
Guide) on each party member who helped slay the grells.
