NIHILOOR 
The illithid Nihiloorworks for Xanathar, spending its 
days creating intellect devourers and setting them loose 
in the sewers ofWaterdeep. Each intellect devourer at-
tacks the first humanoid it encounters, using its victim 
as a puppet to spy on the city and relay information back 
to Nihiloor. Occasionally, an intellect devourer is in-
structed to seek out a particular kind of target, such as a 
member of the City Guard or the City Watch. Sometimes 
its instructions will include orders to capture specific 
Waterdavians and bring them to Skullport, where they 
can be enslaved or ransomed. 
Nihiloor has an alien mind, and it considers itself 
Xanathar's equal. It has no interest in supplanting the 
beholder, however, preferring to operate in the shadows 
and pursue its own fell schemes. 
GAME STATISTICS 
Nihiloor is a mfad flayer.

N IMBLEWRIGHT 
A nimblewright is a magical construct created to serve 
as a guard or assassin. Composed predominantly of 
lightweight wood and powered by magic, it can pass for 
humanoid while wearing clothing. Some nimblewrights 
wear plain clothing, while others are clad in flashier 
attire. A nimblewright is emotionless, its face frozen in 
whatever expression was given to it by its creator. 
Duelist. A nimblewright moves like a dancer and 
fights like a swashbuckler, using dodges and parries to 
avoid damage while deftly skewering its foes. 
Constructed Nature. A nimblewright doesn't require 
air, food, drink, or sleep. Damage it takes can be re-
paired with mending spells, but a nimblewright reduced 
to 0 hit points is permanently destroyed.
