ANSHOON YEARNS TO RULE WATER DEEP 
as a tyrant, take over the Zhentarim, 
and use both seats of power to plunder 
and control the Sword Coast. He needs 
the gold in the Vault of Dragons to pay 
off Masked Lords and Zhentarim lead-
ers whose support will be instrumental 
when the time comes to oust Lady Laeral Silverhand as 
Open Lord. Manshoon has a long list of powerful ene-
mies, among them the Harpers, Elminster of Shadow-
dale, Halaster Blackcloak of Undermountain, and the 
Blackstaff of Waterdeep. These enemies would quickly 
move against Manshoon if they learned he was biding 
in Waterdeep. For his evil plans to succeed, Manshoon 
must operate in the shadows for the time being. 
FACING MANSHOON 
A head-on battle with Manshoon isn't likely to go well for 
the characters. That said, the wizard's greatest weak-
ness is that he has powerful enemies in Waterdeep. The 
risk of exposure keeps him hidden, and the characters 
can thwart him by furnishing his enemies with proof 
that he's alive (::iftcr a fashion) and operating in Water-
deep. When it comes to Manshoon clones, deciding to 
"let the city deal with it" is a wise course of action. 
If the characters find themselves at the evil wizard's 
mercy, Manshoon will gladly trade their pitiful lives for 
the Stone ofGolorr and the keys to unlock the Vault of 
Dragons. In exchange for helping him get the gold. he 
promises the characters 10 percent of the trove (50,000 
gp). Manshoon has no intention of honoring this agree-
ment, but it can help buy the characters some time. 
If the characters manage to kill Manshoon and the 
local authorities are made aware of the act, no murder 
charges are filed. Rather, the characters' actions are cel-
ebrated. Laeral Silverhand summons them to the Palace 
of Waterdeep to thank them officially, in her capacity as 
Open Lord. Sometime later, Vajra Safahr invites them 
to BlackstafTTower to thank them for their service and 
offer them membership in Force Grey. 
DISRU PT ING M ANSH OON'S 
OPERATION 
Characters can hinder Manshoon in the following ways. 
RELEASE THE BARLGURA 
1f the characters free the barlgura demon in area K15 
and allow it to roam Kolat Towers, Manshoon loses 
many followers to the demon's rampage. 
R EPORT MANSHOON 
Delivering proof that Manshoon is hiding in Waterdeep 
to Laeral Silverhand, Mirt, the Harpers, Force Grey, the 
Blackstaff, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gaunt-
let, the City Watch, or the Watchful Order ofMagists 
and Protectors triggers a far-reaching effort to oust 
him Crom the city. Such proof can be obtained from any 
of Manshoon's lieutenants, who can be captured and

turned over for interrogation. These lieutenants include 
Sidra Romeir (area K2), Mana fret Cherryport (area K3). 
Urstul Floxin (area ES), Vevette Blackwater and Agorn 
Fuoco (area ES), and Havia Quickknife and Mookie 
Plush (area ElO). 
The ledger in area E13 also contains proof of Man-
shoon's malfeasance. Giving it to Laeral Silverhand, 
Vajra Safahr, Mirl, or a magister provides enough evi-
dence for them to act on. 
Once Manshoon's whereabouts are established, the 
City Guard cordons off and surrounds Kolat Towers. 
The Blackstaff and the Watchful Order assist as needed. 
lf the characters deactivated the force field, the siege is 
brief and Manshoon's forces are routed. If the force field 
remains in place, the Watchful Order can deactivate it. 
When all is said and done, Manshoon is forced to re-
treat to his cxtradimensional sanctum. From there, he 
continues his search for the Vault of Dragons while fend-
ing off attackers. 
STEAL MANSHOON'S SPELLBOOK 
Stealing the spellbook from area E13 causes Manshoon 
to slow his search for the Vault of Dragons while he 
either tries to replace it or sends a simulacrum (see ap-
pendix B) and other forces to retrieve it. 
KOLAT TOWERS 
This dilapidated, two-towered edifice stands tall in the 
Southern Ward. Its neighbors are aware of the magi-
cal force field that surrounds it, and they can see light 
from continual flame spells spilling out of the windows,

Despite these persistent magical effects, most folk 
believe the structure is abandoned. Others think it's 
haunted by the ghosts of the Kolat brothers. They're 
wrong, of course. 
Manshoon posts no visible guards outside Kolat 
Towers, since he wants others to believe the site is aban-
doned. The evil wizard and his underlings come and go 
using teleportation circles inside the towers. 
FORCE FIELD 
An invisible field of magical force surrounds and covers 
Kolat Towers. The field is paper-thin and stands just 
outside the outer wall of the estate, extending upward 
to contain the buildings in their entirety. Nothing can 
pass through the barrier. including air, fog, rain. and 
snow. Creatures that don't realize the field is there 
bounce off it, with birds especially prone to striking it. 
The ground outside the field is regularly littered with 
the tiny corpses of birds that broke their necks hit-
ting it. and street cleaners come by every morning to 
sweep them up. 
DIGGING UNDER THE FORCE FIELD 
There are no openings in the force field, which extends 
1 foot underground. It takes 1 hour for a character with 
a shovel to dig a hole deep enough for a Medium crea-
ture to squeeze through, going under the field to the 
other side of the towers' outer wall. Since Kolat Towers 
is surrounded by other buildings, there's a 75 percent 
chance that any digging attracts 2d6 members of the 
City Walch (veter ans), who pul a slop to it.
