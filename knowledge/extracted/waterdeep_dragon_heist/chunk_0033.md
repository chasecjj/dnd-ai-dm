CHAPTER 3 I FIREBALL 
Matchless Pipe. A switch made of flint is built into the 
bowl of this fine wooden smoking pipe. With a few flicks 
of the switch, the pipe lights itself. 
FINDING N1M's CREATION 
Equipped with the nimblewright detector, the characters 
can search for Nim's escaped creation. A ward-by-ward 
search is the best approach, but let the players tell you 
how their characters conduct the search. Depending on 
where they go, the search could take days. 
A character mounted on a griffon can complete a 
city-wide search in a couple of hours. To secure the 
use of a griffon, a character must either be a member 
of the Order of the Gauntlet on good terms with Savra 
Belabranta or a member of the Lords' Alliance on good 
terms withjalester Silvermane. As it happens, a young 
griffon named Bonesnapper is being trained to serve 
as a mount in the Griffon Cavalry. If Savra or jalester is 
inclined to help the party, the characters can arrange to 
meet the griffon and its trajner outside the River Gate 
the following morning shortly after dawn. (The griffon 
and its trainer normally reside in Peaktop Aerie atop 
Mount Waterdeep, but most civilians aren't welcome 
there.) To gain Bonesnapper's trust, a character must 
succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. 
The griffon won't allow any character who fails the 
check to ride it. 
Nim's errant nimblewright is in Gralhund Villa on 
Saerdoun Street, in the North Ward. It isn't, however, 
the only nimblewright to be found outside the House 
of Inspired Hands. If the characters decide to search 
the Dock Ward, the nimblewright detector starts to 
whir when it comes within range of a couple of the 
ships in port. 
DOCK WARD DISTRACTION 
Zardoz Zord, owner of the Sea Maidens Faire, has 
brought his three ships to Waterdeep. Two of these gal-
leons, the Heartbreaker and the Hell raiser, are docked. 
Zord's flagship, the Eyecatcher, is anchored in Deepwa-
ter Harbor. Each of the three ships (described in chapter 
7) has at least one nimblewright aboard. 
The docks are bustling and chaotic during the day, 
except in winter. At night, darkness provides sufficient 
cover for characters to approach the docked vessels 
unseen. If one or more characters are caught aboard a 
ship, the crew tries to corner them until the shjp's cap-
tain can have words with them. The nimblewrights, they 
say, are "attractions and nothing more." If the characters 
ask to speak to the owner of the fleet, a sending spell is 
used to contact Zord, who invites the characters to dine 
with him aboard the Eyecatcher. 
Dining with Zardoz Zord. Characters who accept 
Zord's offer are shuttled by dinghy to his flagship, 
welcomed aboard by drow crew members magically 
disguised as attractive humans (see chapter 7 for more 
information). and led to the captain's dining cabin 
(areajlO):

The dining cabin is bedecked with golden filigree, the 
purple curtains festooned with silken tassels, the wood 
paneling scented with perfume. A magnificent feast laid 
out on golden platters sprawls atop a mahogany table of 
exquisite craftsmanship. Even the doilies are something 
to behold. Standing behind it all with wine glass in hand 
is a well-built, scantily clad man, his scarlet apparel de-
signed to accentuate his trim figure and bountiful chest 
hair. A Aashy rapier hangs from his stylish belt. 
"Welcome aboard the fyecatcher," he says, Aashing his 
pearly white teeth. "Zardoz Zord. at your service." 
This dashing figure is none other than j arlaxle Baenre 
(see appendix B) magically disguised as Zardoz Zord. 
The characters have piqued Jarlaxle's curiosity. He 
doesn't know much about them (yet) and wants to de-
termine whether they pose a threat {they don't). To win 
them over, he shares the following information over din-
ner and wine: 
• The Sea Maidens Faire, owned and operated by Zord, 
is a seafaring carnival based in Luskan that travels 
along the Sword Coast. It provides good, wholesome 
entertainment in the form of fantastic street parades. 
• The Heartbreaker and the Hell raiser are used to 
transport entertainers, wagons, and parade floats. The 
Eyecatcher is Zord's command ship and private yacht. 
All three ships are built for comfort and speed. 
• Zord visits the distant island of Lantan about once 
a year. During his last visit, he purchased four nim-
blewrights from a Lantanese wizard. He keeps two 
aboard bis flagship, and one aboard each of the other 
two vessels. 
• When they're not marching in a parade, Zord's 
nimblewrights remain aboard his ships. "They're 
perfectly harmless," he attests, whereupon a 
nimblewright holding a decanter enters the dining 
cabin and quietly refills everyone's wine glasses. 
If the characters mention the Stone of Golorr, Zord 
shrugs his shoulders in a manner that suggests he 
doesn't know what they're talking about. He also feigns 
disinterest in Waterdeep politics, saying, "Every city 
has problems, l suppose. My job as an entertainer is 
to make people forget about politics for a while." Char-
acters who are suspicious of Zord can make a DC 24 
Wisdom (Insight) check. Any character who succeeds 
on the check senses that there's much more to him than 
meets the eye. 
Jarlaxle owns a hat of disguise but doesn't need it to 
hide his true form while he's aboard any of his ships. 
His disguise (and the disguises of his drow subordi-
nates) can be dispelled only by destroying the ship's 
figurehead (see chapter 7). If the characters somehow 
discern his true form,Jarlaxle gives the party a slow nod 
of his head, dryly says "Bravo!" and lets them make the 
next move. 
When dinner is concluded, Zord bids the characters 
farewell and sees that they are escorted safely back to 
the docks. 
DROW CHARACTERS 
If the adventuring party includes one or more drow 
characters, Captain Zord pays close attention to what 
they do and say, but doesn't treat them any differently 
from the other party members. 
WHAT RENAER K NOWS 
At some point during their investigation, the characters 
might want to speak to Renaer Neverember about the 
fireball, given his own recent brush with the Zhentarim. 
Conversely, he could decide to pay them a visit at their 
tavern. If he's told that a gnome and two Zhents were 
killed in the blast, Renaer drops a bombshell: 
"When the Lords ofWaterdeep ousted my father, I 
thought his long, dark shadow was finally gone for good. 
The truth is, I want nothing to do with him. But his spies 
hound me. One of them, a gnome named Dalakhar, had 
been watching me for months. Then, about two tendays 
ago, the spy was suddenly nowhere to be seen. My father 
didn't trust many people, but he trusted that gnome. 
"I spoke to a few of Dalakhar's friends. Apparently, he 
was on a special mission to retrieve the Stone of Golorr 
and was afraid that the Zhentarim and the Xanathar 
Guild were close to catching him. When he heard about 
my kidnapping, he wanted more information about the 
adventurers who had rescued me. I think Dalakhar was 
planning to pay you to deliver the Stone of Colorr to my 
father in Neverwinter." 
Any attempt to follow up with Dalakhar's friends proves 
futile, since they have gone into hiding in the wake of the 
gnome's sudden demise. 
If the characters tell Renaer that Fala Lefaliir saw a 
man fleeing Trollskull Alley (see "Eyewitnesses," page 
45), Renaer reaches out to his friends in the Harpers. 
A day later, he returns with the following information: 
The man Fala saw matches the description ofUrstul 
Floxin, a suspected member of the Black Network. 
• Another North Ward resident claims he saw Urstul 
enter Gralhund Villa, in the North Ward, shortly after 
the fireball incident. The resident reported him to the 
City Watch because Urstul looked suspicious. 
• Two City Watch constables spoke to Lord Gralhund. 
He assured them that no one had broken into the 
estate and that everything was fine. The constables 
had no grounds to get a search warrant, so they didn't 
pursue the matter.
