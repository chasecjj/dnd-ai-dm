three carnival ships (the Eyecatcher, the Heartbreaker, 
and the Hell raiser) crewed by disguised drow and a host 
of non-drow performers (musicians, acrobats, actors, 
and the like). The ships' cargo consists mostly of wagons 
and floats that can be hastily assembled and paraded 
through the city. The drow use these parades to draw 
attention away from their illicit activities. 
fn the magical guise of a flamboyant Tlluskan captain 
named Zardoz Zord,Jarlaxle oversees things from the 
Eyecatcher, his flagship, and the Scarlet Marpenoth, a 
submarine mounted underneath it. He relies on three 
drow gunslingers- Fel'rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg Masq'il'yr, 
and Soluun Xibrindas- to do most of his dirty work in 
the city. For more information onJarlaxle and his lieu-
tenants, see appendix B. 
Bregan D'aerthe is skilled at infiltrating criminal orga-
nizations. Xanathar's drow advisor. ar'I Xibriodas (see 
appendix B), is actually a Bregan D'aerthe spy. 
Bregan D'aerthe support comes in these ways: 
• The adventurers receive small, unmarked black 
pouches of coins from an anonymous source. 
• The adventurers receive an invitation lo dine with 
Zardoz Zord aboard his flagship, during whichjar-
laxJe takes their measure and offers assistance if they 
impress him. 
• Bregan D'aerthe members buy off or quietly dispose 
of individuals who threaten the adventurers (usually 
without asking). 
EMERALD ENCLAVE 
A character must demonstrate an interest in protecting 
nature or the natural order to join the Emerald Enclave. 
Druids and rangers are especially welcome. 
Waterdeep harbors a few members of the faction. 
which seeks to foster harmony between nature and civ-
ilization. Members living in Waterdeep help guard the 
city against unnatural threats, including aberrations and 
undead. They also watch over the City of the Dead (Wa-
terdeep's public cemetery) and the city's parks. 
Members of the Emerald Enclave can be found in 
Phaulkonmere. a noble villa in the Southern Ward. and 
at the SnobeedJe Orchard and Meadery in Uodercliff. 
The walls of Phaulkonmere enclose fabulous gardens, 
and the buildings are covered with moss and ivy. The 
place is owned by descendants of two wealthy families-
the Tarms (longtime Waterdav1ans) and the Phaulkons 
(who are of Cormyrean descent). They spend most of the 
year traveling abroad and entrust the estate to a half-
elf groundskeeper named Melannor Fellbranch. He is 
joined by Jeryth Phaulkon, a noblewoman turned demi-
god who serves Mielikki, divine lady of the forest. 
The Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery is run by the 
Snobeedle family of halftings, among them an old druid 
named Blossom Snobeedle. Blossom's youngest son, 
Dasher, disappeared in Waterdeep about six months 
ago. He was infected with lycanthropy and is now a 
member of a wererat gang called the Shard Shunners. 
INTRODUCTION

Emerald Enclave support comes in these ways: 
• Enclave members share information they've gathered 
from magicaJ conversations with animals in the city. 
• Melannor Fellbranch (see "Emerald Enclave," page 
35) provides free food and care for the adventurers' 
animals at Phaulkonmere. 
• One adventurer receives a supernatural charm (see 
"Supernatural Gifts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Mas-
ter's Guide) bestowed by Jeryth Phaulkon (see "Emer-
ald Enclave,"' page 35). 
FORCE GREY 
To join Force Grey, one must first become a member of 
the Gray Hands. An individual who has served in the 
City Watch or the City Guard is eligible to join, as are 
characters who are willing to swear oaths to defend 
Waterdeep, its citizens, and its laws with their lives. Ad-
venturers who show promise might be invited to join the 
Gray Hands, a faction overseen by the Blackstaff, Vajra 
Safa hr. Members of the Gray Hands complete assign-
ments dictated by Vajra. 
Force Grey is an elite cadre of specialized adventur-
ers, drawn from the ranks of the Gray Hands, whose 
fighting prowess is matched only by their loyalty to the 
city. Force Grey attracts the best of the best. Characters 
don't begin their adventuring careers as members of 
Force Grey, but they can work up to that status. 
Whenever Waterdeep has a problem that can't be 
handled by diplomats or the city's other armed forces. 
the Open Lord has the option to mobilize Force Grey. 
Such action is usually taken as a last resort, since some 
past members of the group have exhibited a tendency to 
indulge in wanton violence, causing as much damage as 
they ostensibly prevent. 
Although the Open Lord sets mission goals and pa-
rameters whenever the unit is activated, the Force Grey 
team needed to complete any given assignment is made 
up of individuals handpicked by the Blackstaff. 
If members of Force Grey (and, in some cases, the 
Gray Hands) are arrested for a crime, the Open Lord or 
the Blackstaff will usually intervene on their behalf and 
facilitate their release. 
Force Grey support comes in these ways: 
Adventurers who are arrested are released under the 
loose supervision ofVajra Safahr (see appendix B). 
The adventurers receive a helpful uncommon or rare 
magic item that they're allowed to use for a time (until 
it mysteriously disappears). 
• Meloon Wardragon (see appendix B) or some other re-
spected member of Force Grey helps the adventurers 
out of a tough situation. 
HARPERS 
Any smart, non-evil character can join the Harpers of 
Waterdeep. Bards and wizards are especially welcome. 
Harpers are altruists who work behind the scenes to 
keep power out of the hands of evil tyrants. In the cur-
INTRODUCTION 
rent situation, it doesn't take long for them to suspect 
that the Zhentarim is wholly or partially responsible for 
the escalation of violence in Waterdeep. Harper spies 
might use the adventurers as instruments to get at the 
truth. Various nobles and guild masters in the city are 
Harper sympathizers. 
The Harpers have several secret gathering places 
in Waterdeep, among them Ulbrinter Villa, an estate 
located on Delzorin Street between Vhezoar Street 
and Brondar's Way, in the North Ward Oust south of 
Trollskull Alley). The elf lady of the house, Remallia 
Haventree ("Remi" to her friends), the widow of Lord 
Arthagast Ulbri nter, is a high-ranking member of the 
faction. Other key members include Renaer Neverem-
ber, the estranged son of Lord Dagult Neverember, and 
Mirt, an advisor to Open Lord Laeral Silverhand. See 
appendix B for more information on these NPCs. 
Harpers prefer to conduct their business in bustling 
inns and taverns such as the Yawning Portal, or in quiet 
locations such as the City of the Dead. 
Harper support comes in these ways: 
• The Harpers make common and uncommon potions 
and scrolls available to the adventurers at a reduced 
or deferred cost depending on the circumstances. 
• Remallia Haventree (see appendix B) feeds useful bits 
of information to the adventurers and might also offer 
them temporary shelter. 
• If the adventurers are accosted and overwhelmed, one 
or more Harpers come to their rescue. A Harper res-
cue team usually consists of a bard (see appendix B) 
or a mage, plus ld4 + 3 spies or veterans. 
LORDS' ALLIANCE 
To become a member of the Lords' Alliance faction in 
Waterdeep, a character must be a Watcrdavian citizen. 
Those with criminal records can also join, provided they 
demonstrate their allegiance to the city. 
The Lords' Alliance is a confederation of cities and 
towns up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the 
North, including (among others) Baidu r's Gate, Mirabar, 
Mithra! Hall, Neverwinter, and Silverymoon. Members 
of the alliance must come to one another's aid in times 
of need, and the organization uses field operatives (dip-
lomats. spies, and assassins) to safeguard its interests. 
Waterdeep is one of the most influential and invested 
members of the Lords' Alliance. Waterdeep's Open 
Lord, Laeral Silverhand, uses spies to keep tabs on 
adventurers in the city, rewarding those who place Wa-
terdeep's interests above their own. Laeral employs ad-
venturers as agents of the Lords' Alliance. among them 
Jalester Silvermane. See appendix B for more informa-
tion on these NPCs. 
Laeral spends most of her time in the Palace of 
Waterdeep. Within walking distance of the palace are 
well-maintained government residences set aside for 
the use of representatives of other Lords' Alliance cities 
and towns.
