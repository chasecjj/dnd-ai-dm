D ISCOVERING THE DROW 
Any character who spends l hour observing a ship's 
crew can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
With a successful check, the character notices that most 
crew members speak Common with an Elvish accent 
and exchange hand signals when they think no one is 
looking. A drow character recognizes the hand signals 
as Drow Sign Language. 
The changes wrought by the magic of the ships' figure-
heads (see areaj8) fail to hold up to physical inspection, 
meaning that characters who interact with crew mem-
bers have a chance to notice the illusion. For example, a 
character who grabs one of the sailors by the ear would 
quickly realize by touch that the ear is pointed. not 
rounded as it appears. Additionally, any drow character 
who boards one of these ships instantly takes on the 
illusory form of a human of the same gender, height, and 
weight, because of the magic of the ship's figurehead. 
SHIP FEATURES 
Each ship has the statistics of a sailing ship (see the 
Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table in chapter 5 of 
the Dungeon Master's Guide) as well as the features de-
scribed in the following subsections. 
ALARMS 
If intruders are detected or a fight breaks out on one 
of the ships, the entire crew (one drow mage captain, 
three drow elite warriors, and seventeen drow) mo-
bilizes to combat the threat. The drow prefer to take 
captives or render enemies unconscious rather than kill 
them. Captives are thrown in the brig (area]15) until 
]arlaxle decides what to do with them, and their gear is 
stowed in the armory (area]l6). 
CElLINGS 
Cabins, holds, and passageways have 8-foot-high ceil-
ings with 6-foot-high doorways connecting them. 
DOORS 
Unless otherwise noted, doors are made of wood. A 
door's lock can be picked by a character who makes a 
successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, 
or a door can be forced open by a character who makes 
a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A ship's 
captain has keys to all locked doors aboard his vessel. 
ELEVATOR PLATFORMS 
Each ship is equipped with an elevator platform that can 
be lowered and raised with a lever to make loading and 
unloading cargo easier. When not in use, this platform 
stays in the lowest cargo hold of each ship. See the de-
scriptions of the cargo holds for more information. 
LIGHTING 
Areas belowdecks are brightly lit by hanging lanterns. 
RIGGING 
Rigging can be climbed without an ability check.

AREAS OF THE SHIPS 
The Eyecatcher, the Heartbreaker, and the Hellraiser 
have the same general configuration and occupants, cor-
responding to map 7.L Exceptions are noted in an area's 
description and on the map. 
Jl. MAIN DECK 
Three sailors (drow) and a mate (drow elite warrior) 
are on deck at all times. If the characters board the ship 
and ask to speak with the captain, the mate asks their 
business before even thinking about disturbing hjm. 
jolly Boats. Four rowboats are stacked on top of each 
other on this deck. Ropes and pulleys are used to hoist 
these boats in and out of the water. 
J2 . STORAGE 
The smell of tar permeates this cluttered cabin, which 
contains the following features: 
• Barrels of tar are secured with nets to the starboard 
wall below mounted tools. 
• Against the port wall, tight rolls of white canvas are 
stacked on top of each other and secured with rope. 
J3. MATES' CABIN 
This cabin has the following features: 
• Twin hammocks hang perpendicular to one another. 
Two off-duty mates {drow elite warriors) relax in 
the hammocks. 
Three walnut chests sit under the hammocks. The 
chests are unlocked. 
Treasure. Each chest holds two sets of common 
clothes, a waterskin filled with wine, and a pouch con-
taining 3d6 gp and 4d10 sp. 
J4. CREW CABINS 
Each of these cabins holds four han1mocks. One off-duty 
sailor (drow) rests in each cabin. 
J5. GALLEY 
Heat and savory scents burst from this cramped cabin, 
which contains the following features: 
A busy cook (commoner) works a frying pan with one 
hand and stirs a pot with the other over a small stove. 
Dirty dishes are stacked in a washbasin. 
• A table holds foods in various states of preparation. 
The cook is too busy to speak with characters, and is 
quick to holler in alarm if attacked, drawing the atten-
tion of the crew. 
]6. PANTRY 
Secured to the walls are racks of cooking ingredients, 
including jars of spices, sacks of A our, and casks of lard. 
J7. D INING CABIN 
The crew dines here throughout the day. At any given 
time, the cabin contains the following: 
• Six sailors (drow) are enjoying a meal. 
• Aboard the Heartbreaker or the Hellraiser, the sailors 
are joined by ld4 carnies (commoners). 
CHAPTER. 7 I MAESTRO'S FALL 
• Furnishings include a table, ten stools, and two oak 
cabinets containing dishes, tankards, and utensils. 
]8. FORECASTLE 
The forecastle is within sight of the sailors on the main 
deck (areajl), the aft castle lower deck (areaj9), and the 
aft castle upper deck (areajll). 
Figurehead. A gilded wooden figurehead of a female 
elf with flowing hair sticks out from the ship's prow, 
reaching forth with both hands. Since Lhe figurehead is 
unpainted, there's no way to tell that it depicts a drow, 
but a character who inspects the figurehead closely and 
succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check no-
tices a tiny embossed spider on its forehead. 
A detect magic spell or similar magic reveals an aura 
of illusion magic around the figurehead- the effect that 
makes every drow aboard the ship appear as a human. 
A drow's gender, height, and weight are unchanged; the 
illusion affects only appearance, not voice or manner-
isms. Casting dispel magic on a disguised drow causes 
the illusion around it to wink out only for a moment. An 
antimagic field suppresses the figurehead's magic within 
the field's area. Destroying the figurehead ends the ef-
fect throughout the ship. A figurehead has AC 15, 50 hit 
points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. 
J9. AFT CASTLE LOWER DECK 
This deck has the following features: 
• Two sailors (drow) are here at all times. 
Stairs to port and starboard climb to the aft castle up-
per deck (areajll) and the captain's wheel. 
Anchor. The ship's anchor is accessed from this deck. 
It can be raised or lowered by one creature in 10 rounds 
(1 minute), by two creatures in 5 rounds, by three crea-
tures in 3 rounds, or by four creatures in 1 round. 
JlO. CAPTAIN'S CABIN 
Regardless of which ship the characters are on, this op-
ulent cabin contains the following features: 
• Stylish purple drapes cover the large windows that 
look out over the harbor. 
To one side of a central pillar rests a comfortable bed, 
its oak headboard carved to resemble a kraken. An 
oak dining table surrounded by six high-backed chairs 
rests on the opposite side of the central pillar . 
• Other furnishings include a glass-doored cabinet con-
taining shelves of books, a wooden trunk sealed with 
a padlock, and a small writing desk. 
Captain. Each ship's captain {drow mage) can usually 
be found here, with a nimblewrigbt (see appendix B) 
acting as an attendant and bodyguard. 
A captain is happy to meet with characters who ask 
to speak with him, mostly to gauge whether they pose 
a threat. If the characters are polite, the captain invites 
them to join him for a meal. If the characters grow tire-
some or threatening, he commands them to leave the 
ship at once, sounding an alarm if they refuse. 
Fastened to each captain's belt is a ring holding a 
number of keys. One key unlocks the trunk in this cabin; 
other keys unlock any locked doors on the captain's ship.
