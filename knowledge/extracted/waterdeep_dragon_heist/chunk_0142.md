ZIRAJ THE HUNTER 
Ziraj is a half-ore hunter who wields an oversized bow 
Lhat shoots correspondingly large arrows. He is the 
Master of Assassination for the Black Network. If Ziraj 
sets out to kill someone, it's because one of his friends 
(Oavil, Istrid. Skeemo, or Tashlyn) asked him to. The 
characters might become Ziraj's prey, or Ziraj might 
come to their aid to eliminate a common enemy. He's 
the strong, silent type. 
The City Watch has received reports of a figure who 
haunts the rooftops of Waterdeep- a hulking shadow 
that glares from its perch, rains down death in the form 
of long black arrows, and slinks off without so much as a 
whisper. Where he comes from if he even has a home-
remains a mystery, as does the question of where he 
might show up next. 
Treasure. Ziraj wears +2 leather armor and carries 
an oversized longbow. This unique weapon can be used 
only by a Medium or larger creature that has a Strength 
of 18 or higher. The bow shoots oversized arrows that 
deal piercing damage equal to 2d6 +the wielder's 
Strength modifier. Its range is the same as an ordi-
nary longbow.

Dreadful Aspect (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). Ziraj 
exudes magical menace. Each enemy within 30 feet of him 
must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be fright· 
ened ofZiraj for l minute. If a frightened enemy ends its turn 
more than 30 feet away from Ziraj, the enemy can repeat the 
saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
DROW GUNSLINGER 
Firearms aren't widely available in the North, but some 
members of Bregan O'aerthe are equipped with Lan-
tanese pistols, bullets, and packets of smokepowder. 
These drow gunslingers are expert pistoleers, as skilled 
with their guns as the best archers are with their bows. 
fEL'REKT L AFEEN 
Fel'rekt is a male drow who was born female. Unhappy 
with the treatment of males in his society, he petitioned 
to join Bregan D'aerthe. jarlaxle took a shine to Fel'rekt 
almost immediately, and the young drow has since be-
come one ofjarlaxle"s most loyal lieutenants. Eager to 
prove himself, Fel'rekt is quick to volunteer for tasks and 
hurls himself into combat with verve. 
Fel'rekt and Krebbyg Masq'il'yr are close friends 
and work as a team, trading banter and jokes at their 
enemies' expense. Fel'rekt lacks the cruelty common to 
most drow, and he won't kill an adversary unless he is 
left with no other choice.

Fey Ancestry. The drow has advantage on saving throws against

ing at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on the drow's

tacks with a pistol.
