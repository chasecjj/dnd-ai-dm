MELOON WARDRAGON 
Meloon is a handsome, formidable warrior in his prime. 
who serves the goddess Tymora and loves a good fight. 
His friends- among them Renaer Neverember and 
Vajra Safahr- describe him as honest. optimistic. and 
extraordinarily lucky. Until recently. he was a member 
of Force Grey and reported directly to the Blackstaff. ln 
recent months, Meloon has spent mueb of his time at the 
Yawning Portal. 
Three months ago, out of boredom. Meloon accompa-
nied a fledgling band of adventurers on an expedition to 
Undermountain. There, his luck ran out. While resting 
in the dungeon, the adventuring party was attacked by 
monsters unleashed by Xanathar- including a number 
of intellect devourers. One of the creatures succeeded in 
magically devouring and replacing Meloon's brain, turn-
ing the champion of Tymora into a puppet. After finish-
ing off his unsuspecting companions, Meloon returned 
to Waterdcep as a Xanathar Guild spy. 
The intellect devourer that inhabits Meloon's skull was 
bred by Nihiloor, a mind flayer in Xanathar's employ. It 
knows everything Meloon knew, and Meloon behaves 
much as he did before his descent into Undermountain. 
He hangs out at the Yawning Portal. tries to bond with 
adventurers, and offers a helping hand whenever doing 
so feels appropriate. The intellect devourer's primary 
goals are to steer adventurers away from Undermoun-
tain and get them to undertake quests that further 
the aims of Xanathar. Such quests usually involve the 
eradication of Xanathar's enemies, and Meloon is all too 
eager to fight alongside those who fall for his ruse.

M IRT 
Once known as Mirt the Merciless and the Old Wolf, 
Mirt made a fortune and carved out a reputation as an 
adventurer and philanderer. Today, an older and wiser 
Mi rt serves as one of the Masked Lords, a Harper, and 
a close advisor to Laeral Silverhand. The years have not 
worn him down, and though he has grown soft in the 
flesh, he remains deceptively strong, vigorous, and clear 
of mind. Mi rt has survived the passing of centuries by 
means of magic, and of all the Masked Lords, he is the 
least concerned with concealing his identity. 
Despite his prodigious girth, Mirt can move with good 
speed when he must, and he hasn't let his adventuring 
skills wither. His wife, Asper, passed away several years 
ago, and his rambling mansion has seen better days. 
Mirt spends his days embroiled in politics and whiles 
away his nights in drink and debauchery.
