Zhents. Two female lightfoot halflings-Havia Quick-
knife and Mookie Plush- believe that Manshoon is the 
rightful leader of the Zhentarim. They serve him fear-
lessly, and will sacrifice themselves to ensure that his 
plans come to fruition. They are martial arts adepts 
(see appendix B), with these changes: 
• Havia and Mookie are lawful evil. 
• They have 49 (lld6 + 11) hit points each. 
They have these racial traits: They are Small, and 
their walking speed is 25 feet. They can move through 
the space of a Medium or larger creature. They have 
advantage on saving throws against being frightened. 
They speak Common and Halfling. 
Havia and Mookie each wear a teleporter ring (see 
"Teleporter Rings," page 157). 
Ell. ZHENT QUARTERS 
This room contains the following features: 
• Pressed against the walls of this room are five wooden 
beds (three sized for humans, two for halflings). 
• Next to each bed is a wooden chest. 
• An alabaster staircase descends to area El2. 
Kaevja Cynavero, Yevette Blackwater, Agoro Fuoco, 
Havia Quickknife, and Mookie Plush all sleep here. 
Treasure. In addition to folded clothes and worthless 
personal effects, each of the chests holds treasure. 
Kaevja's chest contains a gold amulet inset with a red 
crystal rune (worth 250 gp). A successful DC 15 Intelli-
gence (Arcana) check reveals that the rune is a symbol 
of evocation, though the amulet is nonmagical. 
Yevette's chest has three potions of healing. 
Agorn's chest contains a bundle of love letters from 
someone named Tamzyn. Hidden in one of the enve-
lopes is an elegant platinum necklace (worth 250 gp), 
featuring a tiny cameo containing a sketched portrait of 
a beautiful Turami woman. 
In Havia's chest is a golden comb shaped like a styl-
ized dragon with tiny rubies for eyes (worth 250 gp). 
Mookie's chest contains a tiny halfling doll. Stuffed 
inside the doll is a pouch that holds five 100 gp pearls. 
El2. MANSHOON'S QUARTERS 
No one aside from Manshoon is allowed down here. The 
alabaster stairs that lead to this room descend 10 feet 
farther to area El3. 
This room contains the following features: 
• Across from the stairs stands a large bed with pur-
ple sheets. Sitting on the edge of the bed is a hand-
some young male human in elegant robes. Long 
black hair partially conceals his angelic face as he 
attaches a metal appendage to the withered stump of 
his left arm. 
The only other piece of furniture is a table with legs 
carved to resemble winged serpents. Displayed on the 
table is a metal mask with an intimidating, tyranni-
cal visage. 
The handsome young figure is Manshoon (see appen-
dix B), who is much older than he looks. 
CHAPTER 8 I WINTER WIZARDRY 
This version of Manshoon isn't spoiling for a fight. 
He commends the characters for making it this far and 
shows no concern for the Zhents they defeated to reach 
him, since he considers all his followers expendable. 
The characters' best chance of survival is to convince 
Manshoon that they can be cowed or bribed into work-
ing for him. Weary of his conflict with the Xanathar 
Guild, Manshoon suggests that the characters prove 
their usefulness to him by hunting down and killing 
Xanathar in its lair (see chapter 5). Manshoon also 
demands that they keep his presence in Waterdeep 
a secret for now, saying that he will reward them for 
their discretion "when the time comes." In exchange, 
he allows the characters to return to Waterdeep and 
promises them positions of power in his organization 
once Xanathar's death is confirmed. He has no intention 
of making good on this promise, but refusing to work 
for him puts the characters in a tight spot, since the evil 
archwizard can't risk exposure. 
If a fight breaks out, Manshooo grabs his staff of 
power(which he hides under the bed) and holds his 
ground. For more information on how to play Man-
shoon, see "Facing Manshoon" at the beginning of 
this chapter. 
Tyrant's Mask. The mask on the table is nonmagical, 
but Manshoon likes to put it on before meeting with bis 
followers. 
E13. MANSHOON'S STUDY 
The alabaster stairs end here. The room contains the 
following features: 
• A plush lavender carpet covers the floor. 
• In one far corner of the room, a low table is set 
between two purple couches. The table has a thin 
drawer built into it. 
In the other far corner, Manshoon's spellbook rests 
atop a black marble lectern protected by an invisible 
helmed horror. The construct attacks anyone other 
than Manshoon who disturbs the book (becoming visi-
ble as it does so). It obeys Manshoon's commands if he 
is present, and it fights until destroyed. 
Table. The table's drawer has an arcane lock spell 
cast on it. The spell can be bypassed by someone 
who makes a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using 
thieves' tools, or with a knock spell or similar magic. 
The drawer can also be forced open with a success-
ful DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check. Inside is a 
leather-bound ledger that provides a paper trail implicat-
ing Manshoon in two blackmail schemes. An hour spent 
studying the ledger uncovers the following information: 
• Corylus Thaon, a racist Waterdavian noble, is paying 
the Zhentarim not to reveal that he hired Zhent thugs 
to assault nonhumans. 
• Jelenn Urmbrusk, a Waterdavian noble, receives regu-
lar payments from the Zbentarim to offset monies he 
loses in bad investments. 
The ledger doesn't reveal that Corylus Thann and 
jelenn Urmbrusk are Masked Lords, or that Manshoon's 
blackmail of them also forces them to use their infiu-
