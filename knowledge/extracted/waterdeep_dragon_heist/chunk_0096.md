MAP 7.2: Sc;ARLE T MllRPENOT H 
The gnomes know a great deal about submarines and 
very little about everything else. They are treated well 
by jarlaxle, but a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimi-
dation) check or a bribe of I 00 gp or more can convince 
a gnome to surrender its master keys, tamper with the 
engine, or pilot the submarine as the characters direct. 
SUBMARINE FEATURES 
The Scarlet Marpenoth has AC 20, 300 hit points, a 
damage threshold of 15, and immunity to poison and 
psychic damage. Tbe submarine's structural integrity 
fails when the vessel drops to 0 hit points, whereupon 
it floods and sinks. The submarine is worth 15,000 gp 
intact and requires at least one pilot and one engineer 
to operate. It has a maximum speed of 2 miles per hour 
and can hold up to 10 passengers plus 2 tons of cargo. 
The submarine has the following general features: 
• fnterior spaces are unlit. (The drow and the gnomes 
rely on darkvision to see.) 
• All furnishings and features are bolted down. 
Chambers are 8 feet high, with 6-foot-high passages 
and doorways connecting them. 
Air magically circulates through a complex ventilation 
system and small metal grills set into the floors. 
Doors are made of steel and have AC 19, 27 hit points, 
a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and 
psychic damage. A door's lock can be picked by a char-
acter who makes a successful DC 18 Dexterity check 
using thieves' tools. A door can be forced open by a 
character who succeeds on a DC 25 Strength (Athlet-
<'llAPTER 7 I MAESTRO'S FALL 
ics) check. jarlaJCle and the gnomes aboard the Scarlet 
Marpenoth have keys to all locked doors. All doors are 
airtight while closed. 
AREAS OF THE SCARLET MARPENOTH 
The following locations are keyed to map 7.2. 
Ul. ENTRANCE HATCH 
Characters descending from Zardoz Zord's cabin on the 
Eyecatcher (areaj30) arrive in this chamber. From this 
side, the circular metal hatch is opened by turning its 
valve wheel. This area is magically pressurized to keep 
water from entering the Scarlet Marpenoth if the hatch 
is opened while the submarine isn't docked to the Eye-
catcher. But if both the outer hatch and the inner door 
are opened underwater, the submarine will flood. 
U2. ENGINE ROOM 
The door to this area is locked. A plaque on the door 
reads "ENGINE ROOM" in Common and Gnomish. The 
room has the following features: 
The engine room is filled with machines that hiss, 
whir, and clatter constantly. A rock gnome named 
Breena Baffiestone monitors the machinery at all 
times. Nearby is a copper speaking tube, which en-
ables her to communicate with the control room com-
mand center (area U7b). 
• Drawers in the walls contain screwdrivers, wrenches, 
and other tools. 


--- Page 144 ---

• To port and starboard, 3-foot-high, 21"2-foot-wide 
passageways lead deeper into the machinery. Me-
dium creatures must squeeze to move through 
these passages. 
Machinery. The engine is a quasi-magical machine 
that controls the submarine's propulsion and depth and 
powers the fins and rudder that control direction. A 
detect magic spell or similar magic reveals an aura of 
transmutation magic throughout the area. 
A character who has proficiency with tinker's tools 
can use the tools to disable the engine with a successful 
DC 15 Intelligence check. The same check reactivates 
the disabled engine. Whether it succeeds or fails, each 
check represents 10 minutes of work. The engine can 
also be destroyed. Jt has AC 16, 50 hit points, and immu-
nity to poison and psychic damage. 
U3. SoLuu N's STATEROOM 
If he has not been encountered and disposed of else-
where, a drow gunslinger named Soluun Xibrindas (see 
appendix B) is here, worshiping before a shrine of Lolth. 
His stateroom has the following features: 
• The port alcove contains a net hammock and a steel 
footlocker. 
A black metal shrine ofLolth covered in tiny spider 
statuettes stands against one wall. Al its top is a sculp-
ture of the demon goddess, with the head and upper 
body of a female drow and the lower body of a spider. 
• A Lantanese diving suit hangs in the closet to 
the south. 
Diving Suit. This experimental device consists of a 
pressure-resistant padded suit, made of canvas with 
iron fittings and iron gauntlets. A fishbowl helmet at· 
taches to the suit's collar and functions as a cap of water 
breathing. 
Treasure. The shrine weighs 50 pounds and is worth 
125 gp as an art object. The footlocker contains a pouch 
holding 50 gp and a potion of healing. The potion's crys-
tal flask, shaped like a spider, is worth 25 gp. 
U4. jARLAXLE'S STATEROOM 
The door to this tidy cabin is locked. The cabin contains 
the following features: 
• The scent of lavender magically permeates the cabin. 
(The scent is created by magic and can be dispelled.) 
• A hammock is suspended in the starboard alcove. A 
detect magic spell or similar magic reveals that the 
wall behind the hammock radiates an aura of trans-
mutation magic. 
Other furnishings include a tall harp with a stool 
nearby, a harpsichord with a matching bench, a free-
standing mirror, and a large wooden trunk. 
Closet. The locked closet aft of the cabin contains a 
wooden rack stocked with sixty bottles of wine. Each 
one is a rare vintage worth 25 gp. 
Magic Window. Touching the wall behind the ham-
mock renders the wall transparent from this side. and 
touching it again makes this "window" go away. When 
the wall is transparent, creatures in the cabin can see 
out, but creatures outside the submarine can't see in. 
Wooden Trunk. The trunk isn't locked. Lifting the lid 
causes panels in the front and sides to open, releasing a 
swarm of mechanical spiders that attacks anyone other 
than Jarlaxle. This swarm has the statistics of a swarm 
of insects (spiders), with these changes: 
• The swarm is made up of Tiny constructs. 
It doesn't require air. food, drink, or sleep. 
• The swarm has vulnerability to lightning damage, 
is immune to exhaustion, and can't be charmed, 
frightened, paralyzed, petrified, knocked prone, 
or poisoned. 
The chest has a secret compartment in the bottom 
that can be detected and opened with a successful DC 
13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If jarlaxle has the Stone 
o!Go!orr. he keeps it in the secret compartment, along 
with any magic items he might have claimed from the 
characters. The compartment is otherwise empty. 
U5. FEL'REKT'S STATEROOM 
If he has not been encountered and defeated elsewhere, 
a drow gunslinger named Fel'rekt Lafeen (see appendix 
B) is here, cleaning his pistol. His stateroom contains a 
net hammock and a steel footlocker . 
Treasure. Fel'rekt's footlocker contains 65 gp in a 
pouch, a comb carved from dragon bone (worth 5 gp), 
and a pair of obsidian dice (worth 25 gp). 
U6. KREBBYG'S STATEROOM 
lf he has not been encountered and defeated elsewhere, 
a drow gunslinger named Krebbyg Masq'il'yr (see ap-
pendix B) is here, sharpening his sword. His stateroom 
contains a net hammock and nothing else. 
U7. CONTROL ROOM 
The control room has two levels: an observation deck 
(U7a) and a command center (U7b), with two ladders 
running between levels. Two circular soundproof 
windows are embedded in the port and starboard 
bulkheads. The window panes are made of glassteel, a 
resilient metal magically rendered transparent. Curious 
merfolk who live in Deepwater Harbor investigate the 
submarine from time to time, and might be seen peering 
through the windows. 
U7a. Observation Deck. If jarlaxle Baeore (see 
appendix B) is forced to retreat to the submarine, he is 
here when the characters first arrive. The observation 
deck is an elevated. 10-foot-high metal platform with 
a grilled noor, supported by two metal columns. Two 
padded swivel chairs are bolted to the deck, which is 
enclosed by a thin steel railing. The height of each chair 
can be adjusted to accommodate a Small or Medium 
creature. Between the two chairs is a bronze periscope 
that can be raised or lowered whenever the submarine 
is detached from the Eyecatcher. 
U7b. Command Center. Three rock gnome engineers 
named Lorella Middenpump, Tervaround Waggletop, 
and Anverth Leffery are on duty here, along with two 
r 
drow elite warriors named Karabal L'enz and Marro 
Qaz'arrt. The drow guard the control room and keep the 
gnomes on task. 
Lorella sits in the pilot's swivel chair, which is 
bolted to the floor and can be lowered or raised to
