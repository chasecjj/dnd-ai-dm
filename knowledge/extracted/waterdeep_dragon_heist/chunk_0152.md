NAR'L XIBRINDAS 
Xanathar's advisor is a nervous and conniving male 
drow named Nar'I Xibrindas. Nar'l's house was wiped 
out long ago, but he and his elder brother Soluun sur-
vived and joined Bregan D'aerthe. A year ago, Nar'I was 
given the difficult task of infiltrating the Xanathar Guild 
and getting as close to the beholder as possible. Not only 
did he succeed, but in the course of gaining Xanathar's 
trust, he managed to convince the beholder to eliminate 
its other advisors. The beholder's paranoia will even-
tually cause Xanathar to question the drow's loyalty, 
though, and Nar'I has become increasingly worried 
about his future. If forced to decide between himself and 
Bregao D'aerthe, he'll choose the former and betray his 
drow allies to save his own skin. 
Xanathar is aware that something is off with Nar'I, 
and recently assigned him a grell bodyguard. The grell 
has instructions to dispose of Nar'I at the first sign of 
disloyalty. 
GAME STATISTICS 
Nar'I Xibrindas is a drow mage. He prepares and casts 
the sending spell whenever he needs to communicate 
with his brother. [n addition to his other gear, Nar'I 
carries a vial containing three doses of eyescratch, a 
contact poison. A creature that comes into contact with 
the poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving 
throw or be poisoned for 1 hour and blinded while poi-
soned in this way. A lesser restoration spell or similar 
magic ends the effect.
