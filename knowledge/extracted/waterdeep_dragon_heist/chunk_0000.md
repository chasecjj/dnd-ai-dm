FOREWORD 
A simple question began rattling around in my head 
over two years ago as I was bidding fareweJJ to Barovia, 
dragging myself out of the depths of Maelstrom, and 
planning a yearlong expedition to Chult. Where do we 
go next? After mulling over several options. we decided 
it would be refreshing to return to civilization. 
Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is a treasure hunt with an 
urban backdrop. We've visited Watcrdeep before, but 
not like this. Clever heroes will respect the city's rules. 
Those who get on the city's bad side are in for a rough 
time, as the City of Splendors is home to some of the 
most powerful figures in the Forgotten Realms. 
Charlie Sanders. a lifelong D&D player. brought his 
experience writing for television to the project by help-
ing flesh out the story bible months before work on the 
adventure was scheduled to begin. Matthew Mercer, 
whom you might know from the livestreamed show 
Critical Role, lent us his boundless imagination and 
helped flesh out the villains and their motives. A D&D 
adventure is only as good as its villains, and Waterdeep: 
Dragon Heist has multiple baddies to choose from. 
Before I pull back the curtain and lead you into the 
heart of Waterdeep, I wish to thank Ed Greenwood for 
making the City of Splendors what it is: the kind of mag-
ical place you wish in your heart was real.
