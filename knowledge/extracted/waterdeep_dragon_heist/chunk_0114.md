drays and hire-coaches- not to accept anything but 
coins minted in Waterdeep. 
Though you can trade your coinage for Waterdeep 
currency with anyone willing to do so, the exchequers at 
the Palace of Waterdeep make exchanges with no asso-
ciated fee. The queue there can be quite long, necessitat· 
ing that you make an appointment-often a day or more 
in advance. For a swifter transaction, I recommend any 
member of the Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters, 
or of the Jewelers' Guild. Both have the most reliable 
scales and abide by guild-wide rates of exchange. 
Be sure to exchange taols and harbor moons be-
fore leaving the city, as their value greatly diminishes 
elsewhere! 
T AXES AND FEES 
As established in the first year of the reign of the previ-
ous Open Lord, Dagult Neverember, Waterdeep collects 
a monthly tax from all who live within its official wards. 
The tax is 1 shard per person above the age of ten 
years, and is collected door-to-door by patrols of the City 
Guard on the last day of each month. 
Individuals who so desire can pay a single dragon 
in tax and receive a writ exempting them for twelve 
months, but the writ must be produced every month 
when the Guard calls, or a new payment is required. If 
the Guard knocks at a door and receives no answer, a 
notice of lien with an estimation of tax is affixed to the 
door. The debt must be dealt with before the next month 
ends, with payment to be made to any magister. 
Those who have no fixed residence can still be taxed 
if they are confronted in any building, be it an inn or an 
outhouse. So if you're out and around on the last day of 
the month, you'll no doubt experience "taxing traffic" as 
the streets become clogged with people trying to avoid 
the collectors. 
Waterdeep also raises revenue by charging other fees, 
such as the following: 
1 nib per day for rental of a stall in the Market 
1 shard (above and beyond any fines imposed) from any· 
one convicted by a magister, per conviction 
1 dragon per conveyance leaving the city, empty or full 
5 dragons per ship that touches dock in Waterdeep (ex· 
cept for city ships and diplomatic vessels), collected 
from the captain and covering a stay of up to fourteen 
days (a ship that leaves the harbor and returns during 
that time pays the tax upon reentry) 
In times of trouble, direct taxes can also be imposed: 
A fire tax (usually 1 dragon per household), levied when-
ever a fire destroys a large portion of the city 
A wall tax or harbor tax (usually 1 dragon per house-
hold) raised to directly pay for needed repairs or 
expansions 
A lance tax raised to provide a payroll for mercenaries 
hired by the city when required (usually 1 shard per 
household each tenday until the Lords repeal the tax)
