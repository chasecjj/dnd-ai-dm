MAP 4 .6 , COURTHOUSE 
teleportation circle in area 05. If the characters had 
the opportunity and the foresight to destroy the circle 
prior to obtaining the stone, the simulacrum instead 
must travel to Yellowspire on foot, giving the characters 
ample time to get away before it arrives as long as they 
leave within 1 hour after obtaining the stone. The sim-
ulacrum tirelessly pursues the stone, and characters 
who flee would do themselves well not to leave tracks 
in the snow. 
NEXT ENCOUNTER 
If a character becomes attuned to the Stone ofGolorr, 
it reveals the location of the Vault of Dragons. under the 
Brandath family mausoleum in the City of the Dead, and 
the three keys needed to enter it. When the characters 
are ready to visit the mausoleum, proceed with encoun-
ter 4, "Mausoleum."

H4. MAGISTER
1S OFFICE 
This grand office contains several plush armchairs and 
a large walnut desk. The seal of Waterdeep is embla-
zoned on the wood floor.

bodyguard.

at a time. The back door to the carriage is secured with 
chains and two padlocks. Each veteran on duty has a 
key that opens one of the padlocks.

bar that obstructs the doors to the outside. A successful 
DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check enables one person to 
do it alone. 
COURTHOUSE: SUMMER 
After obtaining the Stone ofGolorr, the characters are 
arrested by the City Watch soon after they emerge from 
the sewers. 
UNDER ARREST 
The arresting force consists of twelve veterans, a Watch 
sergeant and eleven constables. They demand that the 
characters surrender their weapons and come along qui-
etly. For guidance on how to handle character arrests, 
see "Breaking the Law," page 10. 
The characters are charged with disturbing the peace, 
a minor offense that carries a fine and results in an 
edict. The charge stems from their conduct in encounter 
3, "Street Chase." Depending on how they comported 
themselves in previous encounters, the characters might 
be charged with additional crimes against the city or its 
citizens, possibly including brandishing weapons with-
out due cause, robbery, assaulting a citizen, or murder. 
If they resist arrest, they are charged with hampering 
justice. See the Code Legal handout in appendix C for 
the penalties associated with such crimes. 
Characters who give up their visible weapons without 
a fuss aren't searched, but those who give the Watch 
a hard time are searched for hidden weapons (and 
stripped of anything that could potentially cause harm). 
A character can conceal a Tiny object from the Watch 
with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check. If the Stone ofGolorr is found during a search, 
the Watch sergeant inspects it, concludes that it's noth· 
ing of consequence, and returns it to its owner. 
DOCK WARD COURTHOUSE 
Arrested characters are brought to a courthouse in the 
Dock Ward and confined to cells (area H8) until their 
trial. Any items taken from them during their arrest are 
entrusted to the front desk clerk (area Hl) pending the 
trial's outcome. A character can take a short rest while 
incarcerated and use that time to attune to the Stone 
ofGolorr. After ld6 hours, word comes down that the 
magister is prepared to hear the characters' testimony, 
whereupon the guards in area H8 unlock the characters' 
cells and escort them to the courtroom (area HS), where 
the magister is waiting. 
FALSE CAPTAIN 
If Lord Cassalanter's doppelgaoger valet is still at large, 
it kills a Watch captain and uses the victim's uniform 
to impersonate another Watch captain the characters 
have met before. Then, in the guise of Hyustus Staget 
(see "The Watch Arrives," page 27), the doppelganger 
kills the guards in area H8 with its bare hands and
