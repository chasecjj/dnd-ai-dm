JARLAXLE B AENRE 
jarlaxle is a flamboyant, swashbuckling drow icono-
clast. He leads a renegade drow faction called Bregan 
D'aerthc, made up of disenfranchised male drow, most 
of them culled from destroyed or disgraced houses. 
Gifted with a sharp mind, a sense of humor, puissant 
skill with a blade, and a wealth of useful magic items, 
Jarlaxle infiltrated the city of Luskan, brought a kind 
of order to its lawlessness, and declared himself its 
secret lord. 
Jarlaxle likes to weave a tangled web of schemes that 
leave his enemies baffled- the latest of which is a plan to 
legitimize Luskan by making it a member of the Lords' 
Alliance. The city's unsavory reputation has thwarted 
all previous efforts, and the current leaders of the Lords' 
Alliance have voiced their opposition to Luskan's ad-
mittance. A few have flatly declared that the city will 
never be welcome in the alliance. Nonetheless,Jarlaxle 
aims to persuade Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of 
Waterdeep, to champion Luskan's cause even if that 
means losing other alliance members in the process.

APPENDIX B) MONSTERS AND NPCS 
Tying Luskan's fortunes to those of Waterdeep would 
increasejarlaxle's political and economic power on the 
Sword Coast. 
Jarlaxle has come to Waterdeep in the guise of an 
llluskan human named Zardoz Zord. "Captain Zord" 
is the master of the Sea Maidens Faire, a carnival that 
travels up and down the Sword Coast in three ships: 
the Eyecatcher. the Heartbreaker, and the Hellraiser 
(all words that describejarlaxle). He spends most of 
his time aboard the Eyecatcher, his personal ship. The 
other two vessels carry members of the carnival and 
their parade wagons. 
jarlaxle has forged an alliance with Lantan (an island 
to the south), and has armed his Bregan D"aerthe lieu-
tenants with Lantanese firearms that rely on magical 
smokepowder to function. He has also acquired a Lan-
tanese submarine called the Scarlet Marpenoth. This 
underwater vessel is mounted below the Eyecatcher and 
kept out of sight. Jarlaxle plans on using the submarine 
to flee Waterdeep if his scheme unravels. 
jarlaxle's loyalties are to himself first and foremost, 
and to Bregan D'aerthe secondarily. 
Legendary Resistance (1/Day). If Jarlaxle fails a saving throw, he 
can choose to succeed instead.

and he can attune to magic items that normally require attune-
ment by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. 
Sneak Attack (1/Turn). Jarlaxle deals an extra 24 (7d6) damage 
when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage 
on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally 
of )arlaxle's that isn't incapacitated and )arlaxle doesn't have 
disadvantage on the attack roll. 
Suave Defense. While jarlaxle is wearing light or no armor and
