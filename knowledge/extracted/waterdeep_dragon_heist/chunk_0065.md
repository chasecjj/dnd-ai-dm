Xanathar (see appendix B) gladly accompanies char-
acters to the vault if that's the way to guarantee getting 
its share of the treasure. Regardless of the arrangement 
it makes with the characters, "its share" equates to all 
the treasure. In other words, Xanathar turns on the 
party once the vault is unlocked, unless a powerful NPC 
(such as Laeral Silverhand or Vajra Safahr) is present to 
keep the mad beholder in check. 
BRONZE D RAGON SCA LE 
Zelifarn, a young bronze dragon, has taken up res-
idence in Deepwater Harbor. Many sailors and dock 
workers have seen the dragon, and Grinda Garlotb (see 
"Encounter 2: Mistshore,'' page 65) owns an appa-
ratus of Kwalish that characters can use to search for 
the dragon. Characters who go looking for Zelifam find 
him lurking inside a shipwreck 120 feet underwater. 
As the characters approach the wreck, Zelifarn comes 
out and tries to scare them away. (He's not done search-
ing the wreck for treasure.) He inflicts harm only in 
self-defense. 
A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check or 
an offer of treasure worth at least 1,000 gp convinces 
the dragon to talk with the characters and part with 
one of his scales. If the characters mention the contents 
of the Vault of Dragons, Zelifarn demands a promise 
of 10 percent of the gold before he gives them what 
they came for. 
CASK OF D WARVEN ALE 
A cask of dwarven aJe is easily obtained at any market 
in Waterdeep for 5 gp. There is a 20 percent chance that 
the characters buy a knock-off brand that isn't made by 
dwarves. Any dwarf character can tell genuine dwarven 
ale from the fake stuff simply by having a taste. 
D RUNKEN E LF 
Any elf who is poisoned from drinking alcohol qualifies 
as this key. 
GEMS WORTH AT LEAST 1,000 GP 
One or more gemstones qualify as this key as long as 
their combined value is 1,000 gp or more. Such gems 
can be found during the adventure or bought in the mar-
kets of Waterdeep. 
GIFT FROM A QUEEN 
Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, was 
once the queen of an ancient kingdom called Stornanter. 
The characters can recall this fact with a successful DC 
20 Intelligence (History) check or learn it through infor-
mation gathering. They can request an audience with 
Laeral throughjalester Silvermane or Mirt. Laeral gives 
them a gift- a feather quill given to her by the archmage 
Elminster himself-if they promise to return the stolen 
gold to Waterdeep's coffers. 
INVISIBLE CREATURE 
Any creature under the effect of an invisibility spell 
counts as this key, as do naturally invisible creatures.

PAINTING OF A DWARF MINER 
A painting of a dwarf miner priced at 5d 10 gp can be 
found each day a character spends searching art shops. 
A character proficient with painter's supplies can create 
a painting that qualifies as this key. rt takes 3d6 hours to 
finish the painting. 
PAIR OF BUGBEAR EARS 
The Xanathar Guild employs bugbears, and characters 
can chop the ears off any of them. A live bugbear also 
counts as this key. 
PERFORMANCE OF "YOUR BEARDY FACE" 
The dwarf love song, ''Your Beardy Face," is a duet per-
formed by bagpipers. The characters can obtain this 
music easily for 1 gp and hire two performers to play the 
piece for 10 gp each. A character who has proficiency 
with bagpipes can perform the song, though a success-
ful DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check using bag-
pipes is required for the performance to count as this 
key. A glass jar in Cassalanter Villa (see chapter 6, area 
C3) plays this song when it is uncorked. 
SEVERED DROW HAND 
This ghastly key can be forcibly obtained from a mem-
ber of Bregan D'aerthe or some other dark elf. If the 
characters have encountered no drow, they might hear 
rumors that Xanathar employs a drow advisor. 
SHAPECHANGER 
Any living creature of the shapechanger subtype, such 
as a doppelganger or a wererat, serves as this key. Bon-
nie the doppelganger (see "Familiar Faces," page 20) 
can be persuaded to accompany the characters if she 
is friendly toward one or more of them. The characters 
can also reach out to the Shard Shunners, a local gang 
of halfiing wererats. For an up-front payment of 500 gp, 
the wererats happily oblige. 
SILVERED WARHAMMER 
The characters can buy a silvered warhammer for 115 
gp, or they can give a silver bar to Embric and Avi (see 
chapter 2, area T3) and have the genasi smiths craft one. 
SUNLIGHT 
Since the vault lies deep underground, natural sunlight 
is difficult to come by. Clever characters can buy twenty 
steel mirrors (5 gp each) and arrange them in places 
(and at the proper angles) so that sunlight from outside 
can be reflected underground and shone upon the vault 
entrance. Setting up these mirrors and getting their 
alignment just right takes 2d4 + 2 hours regardless of 
the number of characters involved. 
UNICORN 
Although conjuring up a real unicorn is likely beyond 
the abilities of the characters, they could ask Laeral 
Silverhand or Vajra Safahr to cast the summon celes-
tial spell. The characters can gain an audience with 
Laeral or Vajra through Renaer Neverember or another 
well-connected NPC. If the characters tell Laeral or 
Vajra the truth about the Vault of Dragons and prom-
ise to turn the gold over to the authorities, either one 
CHAPTER 4 I DRAGON SEASON 
agrees to accompany the characters to the vault and cast 
the spell. 
The unicorn need not be a real unicorn to serve as 
this key. The Sea Maidens Faire (see chapter 7) uses a 
unicorn float in its parades, and a stuffed unicorn can be 
found in Cassalanter Villa (see chapter 6, area T18). 
VAULT OF DRAGONS 
Once the characters have the Stone of Golorr, they can 
use it to determine the location of the Vault of Dragons 
and the keys needed to enter it. 
VAULT FEATURES 
All areas of the vault have the following features: 
• Any spell that tries to contact a creature in the vault 
fails, as does any spell that attempts to scry on the 
vault interior or any creatures within. Teleporting into 
the vault from outside is impossible. 
• Walls are made of mortared stone. Doors are solid 
stone slabs with stone handles and hinges. 
• Except in area V9, there are no light sources. 
AREAS OF THE VAULT 
The following locations are keyed to map 4.9. 
Vl. VAULT DOOR 
A 20-foot-high, 20-foot-wide stone corridor ends be-
fore an adamantine double door bearing Dwarvish 
runes. The doors have neither handles nor hinges. The 
writing on them reads, "THE THREE KEYS. BRING 
THEM FORTH." 
The doors part, sliding back into the walls, when the 
three correct keys are brought with 5 feet of them. They 
remain open until Aurinax or someone else speaks the 
command word to close them ("Azaam"). The keys can 
open the doors from either side. The doors can't be 
forced open or damaged in any way, and attempts to cir-
cumvent them with magic fail automatically. 
V2. ENTRANCE FOYER 
This vast chamber has the following features: 
• Three age-worn columns support crumbling stone 
bridges 60 feet overhead, with the ceiling rising an-
other 20 feet beyond that. 
• Set into alcoves are twelve sets of double doors 
made of iron. Each door is 10 feet wide, 10 feet high, 
and embossed with images of dwarf warriors in 
plate armor. 
Crumbling Bridges. The bridges connect area V4 to 
adamantine doors that seal off areas V6, V7, and V8. 
The eastern half of the northern bridge and the western 
half of the southern bridge are unstable. Either bridge 
collapses if more than 150 pounds of weight is applied 
to it. A creature standing on a section of bridge when 
it collapses must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or fall 60 feet to the floor below. 
The middle bridge has a 15-foot-wide gap in it. A char-
acter can clear this gap with a running jump-but part 
of the bridge breaks away under the character's feet on
