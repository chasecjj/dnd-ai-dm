0ROND GRALHUND 
The Gralhunds are nobles who trade in arms and 
mercenaries, and whose family motto is "We see both 
sides." Orond is the patriarch, but he's not a quick-think-
ing or cultured sort- and deep down, he knows it. He 
leaves most of the plotting and socializing to his wife, 
Yalah, to whom he is devoted. 
When several of the Masked Lords were assassinated 
in quick succession some years ago. Lord Gralhund had 
expected his wife to fill one of the vacancies. That never 
happened, though, despite many promises and bribes. 
After she was passed over, Orond became insanely an-
gry, and he has remained that way ever since. 
Less than a year ago, the Gralhunds were approached 
by agents of the Zhentarim loyal lo Manshoon, and the 
nobles formed an alliance with them. House Gralhund 
gives the Zhents coin and allows them to use the fami-
ly's noble villa as a refuge. In exchange, the house reaps 
all the benefits that the Black Network offers, including 
intelligence that its spies have gathered. So while the 
Zhents use House Gralhund as a shield, the Gralhunds 
are using the Zhenls to ascertain the identities and 
weaknesses of the Masked Lords. 
Orond doesn't fully grasp how entwined the Black 
Network and his family have become it is now next to 
impossible to separate one from the other. lfs no secret 
in Waterdeep that the Black Network has firmly rooted 
itself in House Gralhund. But what's not generally 
known is thal the Zhents in House Gralhund are agents 
of Manshoon. Neither Orond nor any other member of 
his family knows about the wizard's clone. As far as 
Orond and his wife are concerned, the local leaders 
of the Black Network (with Urstul Floxin chief among 
them) reside with them in the family villa. 
Orond is a short, stocky man who dresses well and is 
easy on the eyes. When he opens his mouth, his boorish 
nature, inflated sense of self-importance, fragile ego, 
and despicable opinions about "the common rabble" 
come to the fore, and his charm quickly dissipates. 
When not in his wife's company, he is prone to excessive 
boasting and temper tantrums. When he must speak 
to strangers, he keeps his half-ore bodyguard Hrabbaz 
close by, for fear that others might attack and rob him at
