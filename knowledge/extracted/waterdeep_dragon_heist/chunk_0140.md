APl'ENDIX B I MONSTERS AND NPCS 
THE D OOM RAIDERS 
The Doom Raiders were five unscrupulous adventurers 
who liked to plunder lich lairs (called "dooms" by some). 
They gave up adventuring to join the Black Network 
and came to Waterdeep three years ago with plans to 
establish a Zhentarim foothold in the city. In that time, 
they have forged alliances with various nobles and 
guilds and run afoul of others, all the while fending off 
Harper spies. 
DAVIL STARSONG 
Within the Waterdeep division of the Black Network, 
Davil is accorded the title of Master of Opportunities 
and Negotiations because he's good at sniffing out lucra-
tive business deals, and he makes friends easily. 
Like many sun elves, Davi! has an affinity for magic 
and is gifted with the kind of patience that comes with 
a long life span. Unlike most, he's not the least bit 
pretentious or aloof. He keeps a room at the Yawning 
Portal and does all his business in the establishment's 
taproom. He negotiates deals with grace and aplomb, 
even while drunk, and uses an elven lute as a spell-
casting focus. 
Davit can put the characters in contact with other 
leaders of the Black Network's Waterdeep division, 
namely Istrid Horn (if they need a loan), Skeemo Weird-
bottle (if they need magic), Tashlyn Yafeera (if they need 
weapons or mercenaries), and Ziraj the Hunter (if they 
need a highly skilled assassin).
