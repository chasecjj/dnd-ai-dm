HRABBAZ 
Hrabbaz is a muscle-bound half-ore with a cleft palate 
who serves the lord and lady of House Gralhund as 
a bodyguard. He is well mannered and dresses im-
peccably- a disarming appearance that belies a mur-
derous heart. Though he has great respect for Lady 
Yalab Gralhund. he is less fond of her moody husband, 
and wouldn't be sad to see Orond knocked down a 
peg or two.
