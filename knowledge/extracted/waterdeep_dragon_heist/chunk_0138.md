AURINAX 
Aurinax is a male adult gold dragon who can freely 
ignore Ahghairon s dragonward (see "Ahghairon's Drag-
onward," page 6) and reside in the city. Maaril, the 
archmage who last wielded the dragonslaff of Ahghai-
ron, was Aurinax's friend, and invited the dragon to stay 
with him in the city's Dragon Tower. Shortly before the 
Spellplague, Maaril went mad and left Waterdeep. en-
trusting the dragonstaff of Ahghairon to Aurinax. (See 
appendix A for information on the dragonstaff.) 
When Dagult Neverember became the Open Lord 
of Waterdeep, he cut a deal with the dragon. Under its 
terms, Aurinax could keep the dragonstaff of Ahghairon 
in exchange for guarding a vault beneath the city. When 
Neverember eventually removed the treasure from 
the vault, Aurinax and the dragonstaffcould return to 
the Dragon Tower. As it happens, no one has come to 
remove the treasure, and the faithful Aurinax has re-
mained in the vault. The vault is warded against scrying 
magic, and there's no one left in Waterdeep who knows 
about Aurinax or the whereabouts of the dragonstaff. 
GAME STATISTICS 
Aurinax is an adult gold dragon. He often assumes the 
form of an elderly gold dwarf named Barak Clangham-
mer. who uses the dragonstaff as a walking stick.
