GUILD MEMBERSHIP 
Any characters with the guild artisan background are 
assumed to have free membership in one Waterdeep 
guild of their choice. Arcane spellcasters living in the 
city are required by law to register with the Watchful Or-
der of Magists and Protectors, so that they can be called 
on to defend the city with their magic in times of need. 
Waterdeep's most prominent guilds appear on the 
Guilds ofWaterdeep list. By law, there are no active 
thieves' guilds in Waterdeep, and the Xanatbar Guild 
isn't an actual guild but a faction (see "Factions in Wa-
terdeep," page 14). 
To join a guild, one must possess a background, a pro-
ficiency, or a status that the guild values. For example, a 
character with the sailor background is welcome to join 
the Master Mariners' Guild. One can practice a profes-
sion and not be a guild member, but sucb autonomy car-
ries a cost. The guilds do everything they can to entice 
new members to join and pay for membership, and they 
go out of their way to hinder independent business own-
ers, up to and including driving them out of business. A 
baker who refuses lo join the Bakers' Guild might find 
her flour supply cut off. while a wizard who refuses to
