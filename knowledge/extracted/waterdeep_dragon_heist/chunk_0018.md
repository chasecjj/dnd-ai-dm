MAP t. 2: Xl\Nl\T .. l\R Gu1LO H10EOUT (Soun•ERN Wl\RO) 
The half-ore is Grum'shar, a low-end Xanathar Guild 
boss. As soon as his minions retrieved who they thought 
was Renaer Neverember. the half-ore begged Nihiloor 
let him witness the interrogation of the captive, not real-
izing until after he did so that he had mistaken the pris-
oner's identity. Grum'shar attacks the characters in the 
hope of salvaging his reputation. He is an apprentice 
wizard (see appendix B), with these changes: 
• Grum'shar is chaotic evil. 
• He has these racial traits: When reduced to 0 hit 
points. he drops to 1 hit point instead (but can't do this 
again until he finishes a long rest). He has darkvision 
out to a range of 60 feet. He speaks Common and Ore. 
R OLEPLAYING FLOON 
As a result of Grum'shar's torture. Floon Blagmaar (see 
appendix B) has 1 hit point left. If he is healed by the 
characters, he is eternally grateful and shows his affec-
tion by hugging them. He stays close to them, trusting in 
their ability to protect him. lf Renaer is with the party, 
he can shoulder the burden of protecting Floon. 
TREASURE 
In a satchel. Grum'shar carries his spellbook, which 
contains the following spells: burning hands. disguise 
self. false life, shield, unseen servant, and witch bolt. 
Tucked behind the stone chair is a small, unlocked 
wooden chest containing two potions of healing, 16 gp, 
82 sp, and 250 cp. 
Q8. GETAWAY PASSAGE 
This room looks empty, but a thorough search accompa-
nied by a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check 
reveals a rough-hewn tunnel hidden beneath a loose 
flagstone. The low tunnel leads north to area Q9. 
Q9. PRIVATE CELLAR ---
An innocent halRing family, the Peabodys, brews beer 
in this cellar, which lies beneath their home on Fishgut 
Alley in the Dock Ward. Their cellar contains brewing 
supplies and lots of worthless clutter. 
The halfiings haven't noticed the secret tunnel that 
leads to the Xanathar Guild hideout; it's concealed be-
neath a large flagstone that requires a Strength score of 
10 or higher to be lifted. 
D EVELOPMENT 
If the characters ascend out of the cellar and enter 
the Peabodys' small house, the halfiings are initially 
alarmed but can be easily calmed. Upon learning of the 
secret trapdoor, they vow to seal it up again but allow 
the characters to make use of it if the need arises. 
Ql0. SLEEPING Q UARTERS ---
Straw pallets lie on the floor, and rusty manacles are 
bolted to the walls. 
Qll. B ACK DOOR 
This hideout contains a secret roure to Xanathar's lair. 
CHAPTER 1 I A FRIEND!:'\ NEED

In the middle of this otherwise empty room is a stone 
pillar carved with a small symbol: a perfect circle with 
ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from its cir-
cumference. In the middle of this circle is a smaller cir-
cular indentation that bears a passing resemblance to a 
lidless eye. 
If the stone eye in Nibiloor's possession is pressed into 
the circular indentation, an opaque black doorway mag-
ically opens in the south wall. The opening is 8 feet tall 
and 4 feet wide. Any creature that passes through it ap-
pears in area X22 of Xanathar's lair (see chapter 5). The 
door is a one-way portal, and it closes again 1 minute 
after the stone eye is removed from the pillar. 
NOT-SO-SECRET DOOR 
The secret door is plainly visible to anyone who ap-
proaches it from the east. 
Ql2. HOSTEL CELLAR 
A narrow passage leads to the cellar of a halfling-owned 
hostel on Spices Street in the Dock Ward. Medium char-
acters must squeeze co reach this area from the tunnel. 
The hostel is used as a base by the Shard Shunners. a 
gang of ha I fling wererats. They are aware of the Xana-
thar Guild hideout, and the two gangs are tenuous allies. 
Roscoe Underbough, a Shard Shunner in hybrid form, 
guards the cellar. He hides in the northwest storeroom, 
ready to jump out and scare away anyone who heads for 
the stairs. Not eager to commit murder, Roscoe allows 
retreating characters to Ree back to the sewers. He is a 
wererat. with these changes: 
Roscoe is Small and has 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points. 
He has these racial traits: He can move through the 
space of a Medium or larger creature. He has ad-
vantage on saving throws against being frightened. 
He speaks Common and Halfling, and he knows 
thieves' cant. 
DEVELOPMENT 
If the characters defeat Roscoe or slip past him, they 
can make their way up into the hostel, which caters to a 
mostly halfling clientele. With none of the other Shard 
S hunners currently present. the characters are greeted 
warmly by staff and patrons, who point them in the di-
rection of the nearest bathhouse. 
COMPLETING VoLo 's Q UEST 
Returning to the Yawning Portal with Floon Blagmaar 
in tow marks the end of this introductory quest. All that 
remains is for the characters to collect their reward. 
REWARDS 
Volo is drinking alone in the Yawning Portal while anx-
iously awaiting news of Floon's fate. He springs up and 
runs to embrace the characters and his friend as soon 
as he sees them. 
CHAPTER I I A l'llIENO IN NEED 
A GOOD DEED 
If the characters reunite Volo with Floon. Volo gives 
them a rather sheepish look as he explains their reward: 
"I confess that I have but few coins to spare. But never 
let it be said that Volo reneges on a promise. Allow me to 
present something much more valuable." He holds out 
a scroll tube. ''The deed to a remarkable property here in 
Waterdeep! We'll need a magistrate to witness the trans-
fer of ownership. I'll arrange a meeting with one after 
you've inspected the estate and deemed it satisfactory." 
The tube contains a deed to Trollskull Manor, a historic 
building in the North Ward that the characters can 
claim as a home base. The deed has been notarized and 
appears legitimate (because it is). Volo recently bought 
the property because it is rumored to be haunted, and he 
was hoping that investigating it might yield a chapter for 
his next book. Volos Guide to Spirits and Specters. 
lf the characters accept their reward, Volo sets up a 
meeting with a tiefting magistrate named Kylynne Sil-
merhelve. The brief session takes place at a courthouse 
in the Castle Ward at highsun. Magistrate Silmerhelve 
witnesses the transfer of the deed, rendering the new 
ownership official, with the impatience of one who has 
more important matters to attend to. She also collects 
an estate transfer tax of 25 gp, which is normally paid 
by the new owners. If the characters can't afford this fee 
or don't want to pay it and they have befriended Renaer 
Neverember, be makes sure that Volo has a pouch of 
coins to cover the expense. 
FINE FRIENDS 
Volo, Floon. and Renaer all express their gratitude 
through camaraderie. If the characters need to call upon 
their new friends for an occasional favor, any of them 
are happy to oblige. Floon has little to offer the charac-
ters, but friendship with Volo and Renaer has its perks. 
Volo knows the best places to ear and find merriment. 
He can also give characters a tour ofWaterdeep. lf 
the characters accept his offer, share the information 
in chapter 9, "Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion," with 
the players. 
Although Renaer is estranged from his rich and pow-
erful father, he still has friends in high places. including 
Harpers who can come to the characters' rescue if they 
need it. If the characters are looking for an audience 
with influential persons in Waterdeep, Renaer can set 
up meetings with Mirt, Rema Ilia Haventree (see ap-
pendix B for both), or just about any other Waterdavian 
noble, if he thinks the characters will comport them-
selves well. 
LEVEL ADVANCEMENT 
If you're using milestone level advancement instead of 
tracking experience points, the characters advance from 
1st to 2nd level when they return to Volo after having 
explored the Xanathar Guild hideout.
