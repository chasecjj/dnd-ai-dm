passageway that slopes down. The characters can walk 
right through the illusion, which has no substance, and 
a dispel magic spell destroys it. The tunnel wends down-
ward for several hundred feet, gradually widening to 20 
feet where it ends at the doors to the Vault of Dragons.

ment), and you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexter-
ity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone on the far roof-
top. Or you can cross the gap using a 10-foot·long 
rope line that stretches between the two rooftops; 
each foot of rope line costs 2 feet of movement.

CHAPTER 4 I DRAOON SEASON 
ENC OUNT ER 5: 
ROOFTOP CHASE 
This encounter uses the chase rules in chapter 8 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide. It also uses the Rooftop Chase 
Complications table, which applies only to creatures 
moving across rooftops on foot. Flying creatures needn't 
roll on the table. 
ROOFTOP CHASE: SUMMER -------
The characters are trying to catch up with three spined 
devils that keep low above the rooftops, so as not to be 
seen by Waterdeep's Griffon Cavalry. The devils are 100 
feet away from the characters at the start of the chase. 
If the devil carrying the Stone of Golorr becomes 
incapacitated, another devil snatches the stone and 
flees with it. 
NEXT E NCOUNT ER 
When the characters are close to getting the stone, or 
when you want the chase to end, all remaining spined 
devils duck into an alley. If the characters lose their 
quarry, they can question city folk on the ground who 
saw where the devils went. Continue with encounter 
1, "Alley." 
ROOFTOP CHASE: AUTUMN 
The characters are chasing two drow gunslingers (see 
appendix B) across windy rooftops in the Dock Ward. 
The drow stick together as they run, but each one acts 
on his own initiative count. 
Fel'rekt Lafeen and Krebbyg Masq'il'yr start out 40 
feet ahead of their pursuers. They do nothing but move 
on their turns, trying to put as much distance between 
themselves and the characters as possible. Fel'rekt has 
the Stone of Golorr at the start of the chase, but one 
drow gunslinger can pass the stone to the other as a 
reaction as long as the two drow are within 10 feet of 
each other. 
NEXT ENCOUNTER 
The drow keep running across the rooftops until they 
get to the run-down dockside neighborhood known as 
Mistshore. Characters who remain in pursuit can follow 
them all the way there. If all the characters lose their 
quarry, they can question city folk on the ground who 
saw the drow heading toward Mistshore. In either case, 
proceed with encounter 2, "Mistshore." 
ROOFTOP CHASE: WINTER 
A Zhent named Yevette Blackwater (CE female 
Tethyrian human swashbuckler; see appendix 8) has 
snatched the Stone of Golorr and is fleeing as fast as she 
can across icy rooftops during a blizzard. Characters 
who intend to pursue her are 60 feet away from their 
quarry at the start of the chase and must also take to the 
rooftops or lose sight of her. 
Yevette was a vicious pirate before she joined the 
Zhentarim and rose to become one of Manshoon's 
favored lieutenants. She cackles madly in the face of
