The wisest among these leaders gain Ilneval's favor 
and rise to become known as blades, tactical experts 
who advise their chief in matters of war. Blades lead 
from the front, wading into combat fearlessly while bark-
ing orders at lesser soldiers. A blade knows how to use 
orcish ferocity to best advantage, and helps the ordinary 
warriors to work together against their adversaries. 
0RC CLAW OF LUTHIC 
Luthic is Gruumsh's wife and the paragon of maternity 
to all ores. She is the Cave Mother, a fierce dweller in 
the darkness who raises new broods of ores to be vi-
cious and strong. Her symbol is the cave bear, and ore 
females raise such bears alongside ore whelps. Females 
particularly attracted to Luthic grow long nails and 
lacquer them, learning to use these claws as weapons 
much as Luthic uses her own. 
Ore females devoted to Luthic are in charge of forti-
fying and maintaining an ore stronghold. They help to 
guarantee the survival of the tribe, and most are skilled 
in the healing arts. The most powerful among Luthic's 
disciples are the claws of Luthic, which can use the 
Cave Mother's magic to heal, protect, and curse.

Corrupted Carrier. When the ore is reduced to O hit points, it 
explodes, and any creature within 10 feet ofit must make a DC 
13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature 
takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and becomes poisoned. On a 
success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poi-
soned. A creature poisoned by this effect can repeat the save 
at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. While poisoned by this effect, a creature can't regain 
hit points. 
Nurtured One of Yurtrus. The ore has advantage on saving 
throws against poison and disease.

Hit: 4 (ld4 + 2) slashing damage plus 2 (ld4) necrotic damage. 
Corrupted Vengeance. The ore reduces itself to O hit points, 
triggering its Corrupted Carrier trait.
