DRAEGLOTH 
A draegloth is a half-drow, half-glabrezu demon, born 
of a drow high priestess in an unholy, dangerous ritual. 
Gifted with innate magic and physical might, it usually 
remains in the service of its mother's house, lending its 
thirst for destruction to that house's plans to triumph 
over its rivals. 
A draegloth is an ogre-sized, four-armed humanoid 
with purple-black skin and yellow-white hair. Two of its 
arms are huge and muscular, tipped with sharp claws; 
the other two are the size and shape of drow arms, ca-
pable of delicate movements. Although the creature is 
heavily muscled, it is graceful and quiet like a drow. Its 
face is clearly demonic, with bestial features, glowing 
red eyes, an elongated doglike snout, and a mouth full of 
sharp teeth. 
Blessing on the House. The ritual to create a drae-
gloth succeeds only rarely, but when it does, it is a great 
event that is seen by the drow of the house as a sign 
of the demon lord Lolth's favor-and a sign of Lolth's 
disregard for the family's rivals, which were not thus 
gifted. The birth prompts the leaders of the house to 
begin crafting new plans to strike at its rivals when the 
draegloth is fully grown. These plans always use the 
draegloth in a significant role, because its abilities can 
turn the tide in a battle against a house that doesn't have 
a draegloth of its own. 
-Volo 
Subservient Enforcers. Although it plays an import-
ant part in the welfare of its house, a draegloth can't 
rise above the status of a favored slave or a consort to 
a priestess. Before a draegloth is given any duties, it re-
ceives instruction in accepting the role set for it and not 
challenging authority. Draegloths instinctively resist this 
sort of treatment, but most of them take out their frus-
tration on their house's enemies. A draegloth that can't 
suppress its ambitions might abandon its house and 
strike out on its own. Whether these rebellious drae-
gloths are part of Lolth's plan for sowing even greater 
chaos is unclear. 
Brute Cunning and Dark Magic. A draegloth loves 
the feeling of tearing opponents apart with its claws and 
teeth and of wielding the magic that courses through its 
veins. Most are too impatient to bother with complicated 
tactics, but a few go on to learn more destructive magic.
