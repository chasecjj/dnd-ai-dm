YUAN-TI NAMES 
Yuan-ti names have meanings that have been passed 
down through the generations, although spellings and 
inflections have changed over time. 
Some yuan-ti add more sibilants to their birth names 
create an exaggerated hissing sound, based on one's 
personal preference and whether an individual's anat-
001y can more easily pronounce the name in this altered 
form. An adopted name of this sort is recognized as a 
wariant of the birth name, rather than a unique name 
unto itself. A yuan-ti might refer to itself by its birth 
uame, by its adopted name, or (especially among pure-
llloods) by a name it borrows from the local populace. 
The Yuan-ti Names table provides yuan-ti birth names 
suitable for any campaign.

YUAN-TI CITIES 
Most yuan-ti cities were built during the height of their 
empire centuries ago. Since they no longer have the vast 
number of expendable slaves necessary for large work 
projects, the yuan-ti content themselves with maintain-
ing these ancient places rather than building new ones 
for their needs. Although these sites are hundreds or 
even thousands of years old, they don't look or feel prim-
itive-the yuan-ti empire was once very advanced, and 
although it has declined, its culture is still thriving on a 
smaller scale. 
Because the yuan-ti were previously human, their 
architecture reflects human ideas about art and beauty. 
Over time this perspective was skewed toward the con-
cept that the snake is the perfect form, so serpents are a 
common theme in their aesthetic. 
The major buildings in a city usually have four sides 
and a sloped or staggered pyramid-like exterior. It is 
customary for stone buildings to have a series of tiles 
or carvings of snakes encircling the ground level at 
head height. These features are sometimes trapped or 
CANNIBALISM AND SACRIFICE 
The ritual that produced the first yuan-ti required the hu-
man subjects to butcher and eat their human slaves and 
prisoners. This act of cannibalism had several ramifica-
tions. It broke a long-standing taboo among civilized hu-
manoids and set the yuan-ti apart from other civilizations 
as creatures not beholden to moral values. It corrupted 
their flesh, making the yuan-ti receptive to dark magic. 
It emulated the dispassionate viewpoint of the reptilian 
mind, a trait the yuan-ti admired. 
Today, cannibalism is practiced by the most fervent of 
yuan-ti cultists, including those who aspire to transform 
into yuan-ti themselves. In yuan-ti cities, the activity per-
sists in the form of human sacrifice-not strictly cannibal-
ism anymore, but still serving as a repudiation of what it is 
to be human and a glorification of what it is to be yuan-ti. 
Yuan-ti don't have a taboo against eating their own kind; 
a starving yuan-ti would kill and eat a lesser without a 
second thought, and a group of them would choose the 
weakest among them to be killed and eaten. Under normal 
circumstances, however, they bury or cremate their dead 
rather than eating them, but a great hero or someone of 
status might be ritually consumed as a form of tribute.
