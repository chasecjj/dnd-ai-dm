the artistry it demands and because their environment 
is perfect for its use. At least a few skiltgravr ("rune cut-
ters") can be found among any type of giants, even the 
slow-witted hill giants who stomp enormous marks into 
hillsides or gouge them into their own flesh. 
Crafting this form of magic is painstakingly slow. 
Imagine a wizard who crafts a scroll and who eschews 
the convenience of parchment and ink in favor of stone 
and chisel, glacier and axe, or iron and forge. 
Carving a magical rune into an item imbues it with 
power. Like any other magic item, it can be used to 
activate one or more magical effects. A magical rune 
can also be inscribed upon a surface to create effects 
similar to those of a glyph of warding or symbol spell. 
The rune itself determines what sort of magic the item 
or surface holds. For example, a storm rune carved into 
a stone might allow the stone's possessor to control the 
weather. The same rune carved into door or chest might 
deal thunder damage to anyone who opens it. 
A GIANT'S BAG 
A giant on the move always has a sack slung over its 
shoulder. The primary purpose of a giant's bag is to 
carry food. With such an enormous belly to feed (partic-
ularly in the case of hill giants), it's unwise for a giant to 
travel without a supply of nourishment. 
Giants also carry rocks in their bags: a few for battle, 
a few others for hunting, and one or two special ones 
for games. Beyond that, a bag might contain anything: 
tools, mementos, items for trade, or merely curios the gi-
ant wanted to bring along. Some possible contents are: 
• A live pig 
• Three bear skins 
• Longsword wrapped in a blood-caked cloak (used 
as a knife) 
• Keg of ale 
• Caged halfling (for amusement) 
• Chest full of broken window glass 
• Human's backpack filled with coins 
• Skull of an owlbear 
• Large bundle of dry wood tied up with vines 
• A once-fine tapestry that's now tattered from being 
used as a towel 
• Four mostly intact wagon wheels 
• A tombstone (for skipping across water) 
CHAMPIONS OF ROCK THROWING 
Giants have a well-deserved reputation as living siege 
engines- all of them can hurl boulders with accuracy 
across great distances. Rock throwing- for battle, 
hunting, and sport- is a tradition that goes back to the 
ancient times of the giants. Other races developed the 
sling, the spear-thrower, or the bow to artificially im-
prove the strength and accuracy of their ranged attacks, 
but giants never perceived a need for mechanical assis-
tance. Even in places where giants have adapted bows 
or javelins for use in combat, they've never neglected the 
straightforward strategy of picking up a rock and letting 
it fly. Few activities, in fact, seem to give them as much 
satisfaction as the simple act of tossing boulders.

Most of the games that giants play involve throwing 
rocks in ways that hone their skills for hunting and war. 
One of the most popular contests, especially among fire 
giants, involves nothing more than taking turns trying to 
knock each other down with boulders. Frost giants build 
targets out of snow and ice and compete to see who 
can knock down the most with a single toss. A popular 
one-on-one game begins with the challenger throwing 
a stone as far as it can. The giant who was challenged 
then goes to where the stone landed and hurls it back 
at the challenger. A challenger who is stronger wins, 
because the return throw will fall short, but a giant who 
took on a better thrower will stumble away, nursing its 
injuries, as a lesson that arrogance has a price. 
In battle against puny creatures, giants use boulders 
that fit in one hand. When giants fight enormous foes 
(such as dragons) or enormous targets (such as castles), 
they prefer to hurl stones so large that even a giant must 
use both arms to lift and throw one. Giants throw just as 
accurately with both arms as with one, a feat most hu-
mans would find impossible. These attacks are effective 
only at shorter ranges, however, for obvious reasons. 
When they hunt by rock throwing, giants use smaller 
stones, about the size of a human head, that can kill an 
elk or a bear without smashing it into pulp. 
How TO LAY A GIANT Low 
A force allied with giants- or worse, a force made up of 
giants- is one of the most fearsome opponents on the 
battlefield. The giants can rain boulders onto an enemy 
from a distance where only skilled archers, heavy siege 
weapons, or spellcasters can strike back at them. 
At first blush, it might seem that a potent wizard 
would make the best giant-killer, but few spellcasters 
can stand up to a giant in direct confrontation. One 
might do harm to a giant, but odds are it will survive 
the one or two spells that can be thrown at it before a 
well-placed boulder or the swing of an enormous club 
quashes the threat. 
Among those with experience fighting giants, dwarves 
have developed the most effective tactics. To defeat a 
giant, dwarves rely on prolonged, accurate, massed 
archery (favoring heavy crossbows for such work), 
fast-moving cavalry that can force the giant into a dis-
advantageous position, or fanatical troops armed with 
pole arms, ropes, and grappling hooks. If a giant can 
be tripped or pulled down-preferably onto its belly so 
it's less able to defend itself-then it can be entangled in 
nets and cables and disabled by concentrated attacks on 
its head and neck. 
On the other side of the field, giants understand 
that smaller foes will try to target their legs and lower 
bodies. Thus, when they head into a fight against 
human-sized opponents, they don thick boots, greaves, 
armored codpieces, and wide, heavy hide or metal belts 
to protect their bellies. Even savage hill giants peel 
thick bark from trees and strap it around their legs and 
dangle logs or stones from their belts to make the going 
more perilous for an enemy that tries to get underfoot. 
LIVING THE GIANT LIFE 
Giants are exceptionally long-lived compared to hu-
mans, but none are immortal. A peaceful death from old 
age is a common occurrence among cloud giants and 
storm giants and isn't unusual among stone giants and 
fire giants. It's the exception among hill giants and frost 
giants, most of which die violently in battle against hu-
mans, dragons, other monsters, or their own kind. 
Giants live at a slower pace than humans do. In the 
space of four heartbeats for a man, a stone giant's great 
heart beats just once. Giant mothers stay with their 
child for longer than human mothers do, and giant chil-
dren grow to adulthood more slowly. Giants' families 
are small, because a couple seldom has more than a few 
children, and many have none at all. 
The life spans of the various types of giants are gen-
erally in keeping with their place in the ordning; the 
lowliest giants have the shortest life spans, and the 
noblest giants are the longest-lived. Stone giants are the 
exception. Because of their long life spans, despite their 
low position in the ordning, other giants consider stone 
giants to be the wisest of all giant types, just as Sko-
raeus Stonebones is often seen as the wisest of all the 
giant gods.
