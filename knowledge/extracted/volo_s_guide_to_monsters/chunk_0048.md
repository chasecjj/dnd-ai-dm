emotions. At the other end of the spectrum, even a hag 
without lofty status is likely to have strange, single-use 
items that don't emulate common spells or even follow 
the normal rules of magic. For inspiration in devising 
the effects of such weird items, see "Charms" in chapter 
7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. 
If you want a hag to use a weird object of this sort in a 
combat situation, provide her with an item that produces 
a CR-appropriate spell effect when the hag manipulates 
or activates it. The effect might be a benefit to herself or 
an attack against her enemies. For example, a green hag 
(CR 3) might smash an ornate hand mirror, producing a 
cloud of glass shards that damages creatures like cloud 
of daggers (a 2nd-level spell). She might instead uncork 
a bottle of wasps that surround her and stitch up her 
wounds with their stingers, healing her as cure wounds 
(cast as a 2nd-level spell). Or she could take a mummi-
fied toad from her pocket and throw it into her cauldron, 
which immediately spews out inky blackness equivalent 
to darkness (a 2nd-level spell). 
A hag carefully shepherds her use of weird magic 
because the items in her repertoire are often impossible 
to duplicate or replace. To reflect this fact, a hag should 
be able to use weird magic only once or twice per en-
counter in her lair, or only once per encounter if she is 
elsewhere. A hag who is expecting a fight might be bet-
ter prepared and able (or willing) to use weird magic one 
additional time per encounter. 
If a hag is faced with mortal peril, all thoughts of con-
serving her resources vanish-she will use any weird 
magic at her disposal if it helps her stay alive. After all, 
a hag that's not dead has a virtually limitless lifetime to 
replace what was spent. No matter how hard it was to 
acquire that jar of death slugs, or that book on how to 
invoke the razor wind, or the runestone containing the 
three syllables for crystallizing blood, it is better to use 
such things than to risk death by not doing so. 
MOUNTS AND VEHICLES 
Many stories tell of hags using strange, enchanted crea-
tures and objects for travel, and most of those stories 
are accurate. 
Instead of the usual horse or pony, a hag might ride 
astride a giant pig, a goat, or a cow. It's not unknown for 
a hag to use a sentient creature as a mount, perhaps as 
the result of a bargain that creature struck with her. A 
hag that wants to humiliate a mortal hero might require 
that hero to serve as her mount for a year as part of 
fulfilling her bargain. The giant raven that carries a hag 
aloft could be in actuality one of the hag's victims trans-
formed because that individual tried to go back on its 
deal with her. 
Some hags prefer nonliving conveyances from time 
to time, and their imagination in this regard knows no 
bounds. A hag might happily animate and "spruce up" 
any sort of object she can tailor for the purpose, such 
as a clay statue, a huge woven basket, a cauldron, a but-
ter churn, a giant bird's nest, a mortar and pestle, or a 
tombstone. 
Usually only the hag that obtained or created them 
can use her mounts and vehicles. They obey only her 
commands, and their magic responds only to her will. 
If a hag allows any other creature to use one of them as 
part of a bargain, she must be expecting an immense 
return on her investment. 
TYPES OF HAGS 
Each of the five common types of hags prefers a partic-
ular environment. It is possible to find a hag in unusual 
terrain, perhaps if she is traveling or is part of a coven 
along with two local hags. Grandmothers and aunties 
are more likely than other hags to take up permanent 
residence in unfriendly terrain, since their long-range 
plans sometimes require spending decades or years in a 
certain area before returning home. 
Annis hags live in mountains or hills. The terrain 
is easy for them to navigate because they are the most 
physically capable hags. Even with her hunched posture, 
an annis hag is as tall as an ogre. Her skin is bruise-blue 
or black and her claws are like rusty blades. Annis hags 
love tormenting the weak and fearful, and seeing others 
feel fear. Statistics for the annis hag appear in chapter 3 
of this book. 
Bheur hags live in wintry lands, favoring snow-cov-
ered mountain peaks. They are gaunt, have blue-white 
skin, white hair, and are known for their gray wooden 
staffs that give them access to extraordinary ice magic. 
Bheur hags love seeing mortals freeze to death and have 
little if any room in their hearts for kin and commu-
nity. Statistics for the bheur hag appear in chapter 3 of 
this book. 
Green hags inhabit dismal forests, swamps, and 
moors. A green hag's body, whether broad, narrow, fat, 
or thin, is topped with a tangled mane of hair. A green 
hag thrives on creating despair and tragedy in the lives 
of her victims, using her skill with illusion magic to help 
in this goal. Destroying the hopes of others brings her 
unbridled joy. 
Night hags have left behind the world of the fey 
to roam the Lower Planes. They have dark blue or 
purple-black skin with white or light-colored eyes and 
thin, curving horns. A night hag is as least as tall as 
a human, and most are stout or have a medium build 
rather than being thin or emaciated. Night hags enjoy 
corrupting the dreams of good people, compromising 
the ideals of their victims to get them to eventually per-
form evil acts. Then, when a victim dies, the hag can 
harvest its soul and bring it to Hades. 
Sea hags live underwater or on the shore, favoring 
bleak and despoiled places. They have pale skin like 
that of a fish, covered in scales, with glassy dead eyes 
and hair like lank seaweed. Sea hags are emaciated, but 
one might be tall or short, frail or large-boned. A sea hag 
hates beauty in any form and seeks to attack, deface, 
or corrupt it so it has the opposite effect on its viewers. 
One is more likely to defile the inspiring statue in a town 
square, making it into a symbol of fear and sorrow, than 
to destroy it outright. 
SOLITARY BUT SOCIAL 
Hags are selfish by nature, and each one cherishes her 
independence- from the rest of the world as well as 
from other hags. At the same time, every hag recognizes
