A gnoll war band might include one or more of the spe-
cial kinds of gnolls described in this section. 
FLIND 
A flind is an exceptionally strong and vicious gnoll that 
commands and directs the war band it is a part of. It 
wields a flail imbued with powerful magic by Yeeno-
ghu himself. 
A war band can have only one flind, and that creature 
sets a war band's path. Because of its special connection 
to Yeenoghu, a flind uses god-given omens and demonic 
insight to guide the gnolls toward weak prey ripe for 
slaughter. 
Unlike other humanoid leaders that might skulk be-
hind their minions, a flind leads the charge in battle. Its 
flail causes wracking pain, paralysis, and disorientation 
in those struck by it.

GNOLL FLESH GNAWER 
If any group of gnolls could be said to be more feral than 
the others, that distinction would go to the flesh gnaw-
ers. These gnolls eschew the use of ranged weapons in 
favor of short blades that they wield with speed and effi-
ciency. In the thick of a fight, they are capable of dashing 
across the field, slashing and snarling as they run down 
stragglers and finish off wounded foes. 
GNOLL HUNTER 
Hunters are the stealthiest gnolls in a war band, and 
they put their talents to use on the battlefield in a num-
ber of ways. In the vanguard of a war band, hunters 
creep around, picking off isolated opposition while 
clearing the way for the rest of the force to run rough-
shod over the enemy's territory. 
Hunters are particularly skilled with the longbow, 
and they fire arrows with viciously barbed heads. Even 
when a hunter doesn't kill its target with its first shot, 
the arrow strike brings so much pain that the victim is 
hobbled in its attempt to run away. When a hunter on the 
prowl finds prey and isn't concerned about remaining 
stealthy, it sounds a horn crafted from bone that pr<>" 
duces a keening wail similar to a banshee's yell.
