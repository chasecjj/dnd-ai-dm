PHYSICAL VARIATIONS 
No two yuan-ti look exactly the same. Both the snake-
like and the humanlike portions of a yuan-ti's anatomy 
exhibit a wide variety of shapes and colorations. Be-
cause a yuan-ti's appearance is mostly inherited, in 
small settlements all the yuan-ti look somewhat alike, 
while larger settlements see more intermixing, which 
produces a wider range of results.

UNUSUAL ABILITIES 
The variety among yuan-ti doesn't end with their phys-
ical characteristics. Some of them are born with pow-
ers that are unusual or even unique among their kind. 
High-ranking yuan-ti might have one or more of the 
following abilities, either replacing or augmenting what 
a normal yuan-ti can do. 
TRAITS 
You can customize a yuan-ti by giving it one or more of 
the following traits. 
Acid Slime (Abomination, Anathema, or Malison Only). As a 
bonus action, the yuan-ti can coat its body in a slimy acid that 
lasts for 1 minute. A creature that touches the yuan-ti, hits it 
with a melee attack while within S feet of it, or is hit by its con· 
strict attack takes S (ldlO) acid damage. 
Chameleon Skin. The yuan-ti has advantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks made to hide. 
Shapechanger (Pureblood Only). The yuan-ti can use its action 
to polymorph into a Medium giant poisonous snake, or into a 
Large constrictor snake, or back into its true form. Its statistics 
are the same in each form, except for the size change noted. 
Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It 
doesn't change form ifit dies. 
Shed Skin (1/Day). The yuan-ti can shed its skin as a bonus ac-
tion to free itself from a grapple, shackles, or other restraints. If 
the yuan-ti spends 1 minute eating its shed skin, it regains hit 
points equal to half its hit point maximum. 
ACTION OPTIONS 
The following action options are restricted to certain 
kinds of yuan-ti. 
Bite (Pureblood Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 
S ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (ld4) piercing damage plus 3 (ld6) 
poison damage. If the pure blood uses Multiattack, it can make 
two melee attacks, but can use its bite only once. 
Polymorph into Snake (Abomination or Malison Only; Re-
charge 6). The yuan-ti targets a creature it can see within 60 
feet of it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw 
or be transformed into a Tiny poisonous snake, as if affected 
by the polymorph spell. The save DC is the same as that of the 
yuan-ti's Innate Spellcasting ability. 
Snake Antipathy (Abomination or Malison Only; Recharge 6). 
The yuan-ti targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. 
The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or feel an 
intense urge to avoid snakes and snakelike creatures (including 
yuan-ti), as if affected by the antipathy effect of an antipathy/ 
sympathy spell. The save DC is the same as that of the yuan-ti's 
Innate Spellcasting ability. 
Sticks to Snakes (Abomination or Malison Only; Recharge 6). 
The yuan-ti transforms a pile of stick__s, arrows, or similar-sized 
pieces of wood into a swarm of poisonous snakes. The swarm 
acts as an ally of the yuan-ti and obeys its spoken commands. 
The swarm remains for 1 minute, after which it turns back into 
the original materials. 
ROLEPLAYING A YUAN-TI 
Yuan-ti are emotionless, yet feel completely superior 
to humanoids, in the same way that a human can 
feel superior to chickens or rabbits-in a matter-of-
fact, completely objective way that doesn't brook any 
second-guessing. To a yuan-ti, there are only three 
categories of creature: threat, yuan-ti, or meat. Threats 
are powerful creatures such as demons, dragons, and 
genies. Yuan-ti are any of their own kind, regardless of 
caste; although a rival yuan-ti might be dangerous, and a 
weak or dead one might be potential food, it is first and 
foremost one of the true people and deserving of some 
respect. Meat includes any creature that is neither a 
threat nor a yuan-ti, possibly useful for a base purpose 
but not worthy of other consideration. 
Most yuan-ti consider it beneath themselves to speak 
to meat. Abominations and malisons rarely communi-
cate directly with slaves except in emergencies (such 
as for giving battle orders); at other times, slaves are 
expected to constantly be aware of the master's mood, 
anticipate the master's needs, and recognize subtle ges-
tures of hands, head, and tail that indicate commands. 
Only purebloods-which walk among humanoids 
and therefore have to learn how to speak to them civ-
illy-practice interacting with meat-creatures. Much of 
their training involves suppressing their innate annoy-
ance at having to speak to lesser beings as though they 
were equals, or being obliged to kowtow to a human-
oid ruler as if the pure blood were merely an advisor. 
Pureblood spies feel a sort of aloof contempt toward 
meat-creatures, but they can affect a pleasant tone, and 
speak to such creatures with a silver tongue that dis-
guises their true feelings. 
Under normal circumstances, yuan-ti are always 
calmly deferential to those of higher rank. They tend 
to be curt and formal with those of lower rank, for the 
differences between them aren't a source of anger or 
disgust (emotions that the yuan-ti don't feel anyway), 
merely a fact of the natural order, and their culture 
long ago realized that treating the lower castes with a 
measure of detached respect prevents rebellion and ad-
vances the cause of the entire race.
