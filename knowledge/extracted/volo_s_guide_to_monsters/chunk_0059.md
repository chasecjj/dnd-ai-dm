KOBOLD LAIRS -
The lair of a kobold tribe is usually a maze of twisty 
little passages, sometimes stretching for hundreds of 
yards, and frequently guarded by traps. The area has 
a host of intersections, abrupt dead-ends, tunnels that 
cross over or under one another, concealed passages, 
and other features that make the lair difficult for outsid-
ers to navigate. 
Creatures larger than a kobold have to squat or crawl 
in order to fit through the tunnels of a kobold warren, 
which by itself is enough to deter most hostile human-
oids (such as ores or hobgoblins) from trying to invade 
the kobolds' territory. Adventurers trying to eradicate 
a kobold infestation often find themselves stuck in low 
passages too narrow to turn around in, forcing them to 
move in single file and putting the burden of combat on 
the first and last people in line. 
The layout of a kobold tribe's lair changes over time. 
The inhabitants regularly collapse or seal off tunnels 
and caves as they carve new ones. As such, any informa-
tion that might be gleaned about the layout or location 
of areas within the lair becomes increasingly inaccurate 
as the kobolds "migrate" through the rock to meet the 
needs and ensure the safety of the community. 
Kobolds riddle their lairs with traps, using their gift 
for tunneling in conjunction with their skill at repurpos-
ing found items. Even though these traps are often far 
more deadly than the kobolds themselves, the kobolds 
don't feel threatened by having these devices in their 
home, any more than a human is afraid of its vicious but 
loyal guard dog. 
The most common traps in a lair are deadfalls, which 
the kobolds set up either to kill intruders or to block 
off key areas of the warren as invaders approach those 
places. Since the tribe is continually migrating and 
expanding its tunnel system, older tunnels are often 
employed in these traps. A tunnel can be rigged to col-
lapse by pulling a rope connected to a support beam; a 
fleeing kobold can yank the rope, or the beam might be 
in a space so tight that a larger creature can't keep from 
dislodging it as the creature moves through area. Even 
if a deadfall traps some kobolds in an enclosed space, 
they and their fellows can usually chisel open an air vent 
within an hour, and create an opening large enough for 
the trapped kobolds to squeeze through in a few more. 
Any place where a tunnel takes a sharp turn or be-
comes exceedingly narrow is a natural choke point that 
forces invaders to fight from a disadvantaged position. 
Such a location usually includes a small chamber in the 
ceiling that features murder holes, allowing the kobolds 
to drop rocks, poisonous vermin, and other annoyances 
on those below. 
ESCAPE T'uNNELS 
A kobold warren always has at least one escape tunnel 
that leads to a concealed surface exit, and the residents 
always know the shortest path to that tunnel. Usually an 
escape tunnel is rigged with traps to slow pursuers and 
ends in a narrow opening that requires even kobolds to 
squeeze through, to keep larger creatures from follow-
ing them out. 
KILN AND CRAFTING AREAS 
A chamber that contains a kiln is usually one of the up-
permost areas of the warren, because the fire needs to 
be vented to the surface in order to keep it from deplet-
ing the breathable air in the lair. Kobold crafters spend 
their time in this area, using the kiln to bake mud bricks 
and harden pottery. The room is also used for other 
noisy activities. 
MINES 
Any chamber in the kobolds' underground complex that 
isn't immediately needed for another purpose is mined 
and excavated, both to extract usable ore and minerals 
and to provide room for later expansion of the den. 
MUSHROOM FARMS 
Kobolds aren't good at agriculture, but they can get 
sustenance from subterranean mushrooms and hardy 
plant life that can live underground. A farm area might 
be completely underground, or a cavern near the surface 
with holes in the ceiling to let in some sunlight. 
ROOT CELLARS 
Much as humans do in their dwellings, kobolds set aside 
rooms with deep pits in which they preserve food for 
lean times. 
SLEEPING AREAS 
Every lair has one or more spaces for living and sleep-
ing, each large enough to comfortably hold ten to thirty 
adult kobolds. Individual kobolds might rest in a shallow 
pit or a personal-sized alcove, depending on the customs 
of the tribe. These spaces are used primarily for resting, 
although some kobolds might quietly work on crafts 
while others sleep. The creatures' sanitary needs, such 
as they are, are served by a deep pit near each sleeping 
area where refuse is deposited. 
Most of the sleeping areas in the lair also double 
as hatcheries. Kobolds tend to their eggs by nest-
ing them in a shallow pit lined with earth and dried 
grass. Because the eggs are susceptible to cold, they 
are kept near a slow-burning fire, or are protected by 
an insulating layer of dung and decomposing matter 
around the eggs. 
THRONE ROOM 
A warren's throne room is always protected by traps and 
features a shrine to Kurtulmak in the form of a carved 
idol behind the throne. Rather than entering the cham-
ber to pay homage, kobolds offer prayers at its entrance 
with the belief that their god hears them. The location 
might include a basin where offerings such as metal 
nuggets, raw gems, and teeth can be left. 
TRAPS 
Kobolds are amazingly creative at building traps, es-
pecially when adapting natural hazards and salvaged 
materials. They pound nails or spikes through a sapling 
and bend it to create a spring-arm, line pits or pools with 
sharp stones, rig platforms to collapse under anything 
more than a kobold's weight, and so on. Kobold traps 
might look flimsy or poorly designed, but a creature that 
gets hit with a bent sapling adorned with sharpened
