Skiggaret is the bugbear version of the bogeyman, as 
hateful and terrifying to them as bugbears are in the 
eyes of many other races. His name is rarely spoken, 
and never above a whisper. Skiggaret's influence mani-
fests at times when bugbears are forced to act in a cow-
ardly fashion; a bugbear that knows or feels itself to be 
in mortal danger is affected by a form of madness and 
will do anything, including trying to flee, in order to stay 
alive. Bugbears believe that this feeling of fear comes 
from being possessed by Skiggaret, and they don't relish 
experiencing it. After the madness has passed, bugbears 
don't dwell on things that were done in the presence of 
Skiggaret. Talking about such acts might call him back. 
BLESSINGS OF THE B UGBEAR Goos 
Bugbears have no use for priests or shamans. No one 
needs to tell them what their gods want. If the brother 
gods are angry with them, they let the bugbears know 
with bolts of lightning (Hruggek) or by striking them 
blind or dead (Grankhul). Bugbears worship their 
gods simply by preying on other creatures, using no 
other sort of ceremony to show obeisance- with one 
exception. 
In an act of worship that also sometimes attracts 
favorable attention from their gods, bugbears sever the 
heads of defeated foes, cut away or stitch open the eye-
lids, and leave the mouths hanging open. The heads are 
then placed on spikes or hung from,cords around a bug-
bear den. The heads themselves are trophies that honor 
Hruggek, and their ever-staring eyes are an homage to 
sleepless Grankhul. 
The heads of leaders and mighty opponents are partic-
ularly sacred, and offering up such a trophy can provide 
a bugbear gang with a special boon. A gang that gains 
the favor of Hruggek and Grankhul in this way might 
find that the head will emit a shout when an enemy gets 
too close (in the fashion of an alarm spell). Sometimes 
the heads of people who have information the bugbears 
need speak their secrets amid blubbered pleas for mercy 
(as with the speak with dead spell).

HOBGOBLINS 
War is the lifeblood of hobgoblins. Its glories are the 
dreams that inspire them. Its horrors don't feature in 
their nightmares. Cowardice is more terrible to hobgob-
lins than dying, for they carry their living acts into the 
afterlife. A hero in death becomes a hero eternal. 
Young hobgoblins start soldiering when they can walk 
and heed the mustering call as soon as they can wield 
their weapons capably. Every legion in the hobgoblins' 
entire society forever stands prepared for war. 
BRUTAL CIVILITY 
Hobgoblins hold themselves to high standards of mili-
tary honor. The race has a long history of shared tradi-
tions, recorded and retold to keep the knowledge fresh 
for new generations. When hobgoblins aren't waging 
war, they farm, they build, and they practice both mar-
tial and arcane arts. 
These trappings of civil society do little to conceal an 
underlying brutality that hobgoblins practice on each 
other and perfect upon other races. Punishment for 
infractions of hobgoblin law are swift and merciless. 
Beauty is something hobgoblins associate only with im-
ages of conflict and warfare. 
The iron grip their philosophy holds on their hearts 
blinds hobgoblins to the accomplishments of other peo-
ples. Hobgoblins have little appreciation or patience for
