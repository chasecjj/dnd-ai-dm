VARGOUILLE 
Shrieking, flapping, and hideous to behold- with a body 
like a severed head and bat-like wings in place of ears-
vargouilles boil out of the Abyss to infest other planes 
of existence, such as Carceri, where they are a menace. 
Each vargouille carries a disease that creates more of 
its kind; a flock of vargouilles on the wing is a plague of 
chaos and evil waiting to happen. 
Abyssal Nuisances. Swarms of vargouilles flap 
through the caverns and skies of the Abyss. They are 
given little regard by powerful and intelligent demons 
since vargouilles can do them no harm. Even the 
weakest demon, such as a manes or a dretch, fears 
vargouilles only if they appear in great numbers. In the 
Lower Planes, vargouilles rarely get the chance to eat 
live prey other than vermin. More often, they lap up the 
ichor left behind when one fiend kills another. 
The World Awaits. Because of their instinctive hun-
ger for living prey, vargouilles are eager to escape the 
Lower Planes. On rare occasions, the summoning of a 
demon to another plane can bring a vargouille along for 
the ride, attaching itself like a tick. The precautions a 
mortal takes to contain and control a summoned demon 
rarely account for a stowaway, and thus a vargouille en-
ters the world unbidden. 
Ghastly Reproduction. Vargouilles that roam free on 
the Material Plane are a dire threat to all creatures, es-
pecially humanoids. Their awful shrieking can paralyze 
other creatures with fear, and such victims are helpless 
to resist a vargouille's accursed kiss. 
· 
The kiss of a vargouille infects a humanoid with a 
fiendish curse. If allowed to run its course, the curse 
brings about a gruesome transformation as an abyssal 
spirit invades the person's body. Over a period of hours, 
the victim's head takes on fiendish aspects such as 
fangs, tentacles, and horns. At the same time, the per-
son's ears grow larger, expanding and transforming into 
wing-like appendages. In the final moments, the victim's 
head tears away from the body in a fountain of blood, 
becoming another vargouille, which often then eagerly 
laps up its own life fluids. Sunlight or the brilliant illumi-
nation of a daylight spell can delay this transformation, 
and vargouilles instinctively shun bright light as a result.

Bite. Me/ee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 5 (ld6 + 2) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage. 
Kiss. The vargouille kisses one incapacitated humanoid within 
5 feet ofit. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma sav-
ing throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses l point 
of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish as-
pects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight 
or the area of a daylight spell; don't count that time. When the 
cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears 
from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting remove 
curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before 
the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so 
undoes the changes made to the target by the curse. 
Stunning Shriek. The vargouille shrieks. Each humanoid and 
beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must 
succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened un-
til the end of the vargouille's next turn. While frightened in this 
way, a target is stunned. If a target's saving throw is successful 
or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning 
Shriek of all vargouilles for l hour.
