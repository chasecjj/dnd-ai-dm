THE SEA SPAWN OF PURPLE ROCKS 
Visitors to a string ofislands called the Purple Rocks (in 
the Forgotten Realms setting) might notice one curious 
fact about the islands' human inhabitants: no infants or 
elderly are among them. This is because babies born to 
the Rocklanders are cast into the sea and claimed by a 
kraken named Slarkrethel. The experience transforms the 
children into fanatics dedicated to the kraken. They return 
from the sea as humans, but when they reach old age, they 
transform into sea spawn and rejoin their master in the 
dark depths. Some children return having suffered partial 
transformations, leaving them semi-bestial until their full 
transformation when they reach old age. These wretches 
are hidden until their final change, to keep the secret of the 
Purple Rocks. 
Kraken priests (described in appendix 8) are the tenders 
of the kraken's flock. Most of the priests are island natives, 
but some are merfolk, merrow, or sea elves that live in the 
water around the Purple Rocks.

Limited Amphibiousness. The sea spawn can breathe air and 
water, but needs to be submerged in the sea at least once a day 
for l minute to avoid suffocating. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The sea spawn makes three attacks: two unarmed 
strikes and one with its Piscine Anatomy. 
Unarmed Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach S ft., 
one target. Hit: 4 (ld4 + 2) bludgeoning damage. 
Piscine Anatomy. The sea spawn has one or more of the follow-
ing attack options, provided it has the appropriate anatomy: 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +S to hit, reach S ft., one target. 
Hit: 4 (ld4 + 2) piercing damage. 
Poison Quills. Melee Weapon Attack: +S to hit, reach S ft., one 
creature. Hit: 3 (ld6) poison damage, and the target must 
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poi-
soned for l minute. The target can repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on 
a success. 
Tentacle. Me/ee Weapon Attack: +S to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hit: S (ld6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is 
grappled (escape DC 12) ifit is a Medium or smaller creature. 
Until this grapple ends, the sea spawn can't use this tentacle 
on another target. 
SEA SPAWN 
Many of the stories sung as sea shanties and passed 
on as tales in dockside taverns tell of people lost to the 
sea-but not merely drowned and gone. These unfortu-
nates are taken by the ocean and live on as sea spawn, 
haunting the waves like tortured reflections of their 
former selves. Coral encrusts them. Barnacles cling to 
their cold skin. Lungs that once filled with air can now 
breathe in water as well. 
Tales provide myriad reasons for these strange trans-
formations. "Be wary of falling in love with a sea elf or 
a merfolk," some say. "Return to port before a storm, no 
matter how tempting the catch." "Honor the sea gods as 
they demand, but never promise them your heart." Such 
cautionary tales disguise the deeper truth: things lurk 
beneath the waves that strive to claim the hearts and 
minds of land dwellers. 
Deep Thralls. Krakens, morkoths, sea hags, marids, 
storm giants, dragon turtles- all of these sea creatures 
and more can mark mortals as their own and claim 
them as minions. Such people might become beholden 
to their master through a bleak bargain, or they might 
find themselves cursed by such creatures. Once warped 
into a fishlike form, the person can't leave the sea for 
long without courting death. 
Anatomical Diversity. Sea spawn come in a wide va-
riety of forms. An individual might have a tentacle for an 
arm, the jaws of a shark, a sea urchin's spines, a whale's 
fin, octopus eyes, seaweed hair, or any combination of 
such qualities. Some sea spawn have piscine body parts 
that provide them with special abilities beyond those of 
an ordinary humanoid.
