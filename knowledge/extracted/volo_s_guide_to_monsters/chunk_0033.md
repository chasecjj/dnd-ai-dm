GNOLLALLIES 
Gnolls wage war against any creatures they meet, ex-
cept for those that have dedicated themselves to Yeeno-
ghu and those that act in accordance with his wishes. 
The Lord of Savagery stains the souls of his followers 
and kindred creatures in such a way that they and his 
gnolls recognize one another on sight and don't immedi-
ately leap into battle. Thus, a war band might include or 
be accompanied by other beings of evil. 
DEMONS 
A fang ofYeenoghu is sometimes gifted with the cos-
mic insight needed to summon forth mindless demons. 
When Yeenoghu deigns to allow it, a war band might 
find itself augmented by some of his favorite demons, 
THE HUNTER'S CHANT 
This simple declaration ofYeenoghu's power was devised 
by a small cult to the demon lord discovered deep in the 
forest. A group of woodcutters, facing starvation, turned 
to cannibalism to survive and ultimately fell under Yeeno-
ghu's sway. Gnolls sing a similar chant in their language 
while they seek out prey. 
The first gift is hunger. 
It is His blessing. 
It is our i;a/1 to bring death. 
The sewnd gift is death. 
Death proves our strength. 
Death purges our fear. 
The third gift is fear; 
We fear that we will fail him. 
We fear the onset of hunger. 
such as barlguras, dretches, hezrous, or manes. The 
Lord of Savagery also has a special affinity for maw de-
mons, which share his insatiable hunger. 
Demonic hyenas known as shoosuvas are dispatched 
by Yeenoghu to aid his most exalted champions. Among 
the gnolls, the appearance of a shoosuva is a reward for 
recent triumphs and a harbinger of great victories and 
much feasting to come. A shoosuva protects the war 
band's most powerful members and serves as a compan-
ion to the strongest fang ofYeenoghu in the group. 
For more information on maw demons and shoosuvas, 
see chapter 3 of this book. 
GHOULS 
Ghoul packs emerge from graveyards and dungeons to 
trail in the wake of a war band, feasting on the remains 
of its victims and sometimes eventually merging with 
the group. Although ghouls typically revere Orcus, their 
endless hunger can prompt them to turn to Yeenoghu. 
HYENAS 
Large packs of hyenas follow gnoll war bands. For their 
part, the gnolls largely ignore these animals. They tend 
to gather around fangs in battle, eager to partake ofYee-
noghu's blessing and its horrid transformation. 
LEUCROTTAS 
Brought forth during Yeenoghu's ancient incursions into 
the world, leucrottas are bigger, smarter, and faster than 
gnolls. When one joins a war band, it doesn't strive to 
lead the group (which would cause unneeded conflict) 
but rather to serve and protect its leader. A leucrotta's 
dedication to Yeenoghu is as fervent as that of any gnoll,

and its main goal is always to advance the cause of the 
Lord of Savagery over its own. 
For more information on leucrottas, see chapter 3 of 
this book. 
TROLLS 
Of all the creatures encountered by gnolls, trolls are the 
most likely to join them simply because the gnolls' way 
of life appeals to them. As ravenous creatures with in-
credible toughness, trolls fit well into the loose scheme 
of a gnoll war band. 
CREATING A GNOLL WAR BAND 
To include a gnoll war band in your campaign, or if you 
need to generate one quickly for use in an encounter, 
use the tables in this section. Roll on each one in turn 
to determine the war band's name, components, and 
unique traits. 
The War Band Name table is set up to create two-
word names. Some war bands become infamous 
enough to earn an epithet from their enemies, but only 
the most powerful flinds and pack lords bother to name 
the groups they lead. 
The War Band Composition table determines how 
many gnolls and hyenas the band contains. The War 
Band Leadership table indicates the war band's com-
mander (if it has one) and gives a modifier to apply to 
the composition results: for a band led by a flind, dou-
ble all the results, and for a band that lacks a leader, 
halve them. 
Roll once on the Special Creatures table to see which 
special creature is part of the war band and in what 
numbers. The Shared Physical Trait and Notable Behav-
ior or Tactics tables add some distinctive flavor to the 
war band. Finally, the Demonic Influence table adds an 
abyssal tinge to the group: owing to the gnolls' supernat-
ural link with the Abyss, their advance toward a commu-
nity might be heralded by strange effects that afflict the 
area or the people in it a day or so before they strike the 
settlement.
