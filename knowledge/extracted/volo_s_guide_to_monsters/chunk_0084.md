EROES COME IN MANY SHAPES AND 
sizes. This chapter presents character 
races that are some of the more dis-
tinctive race options in the D&D multi-
verse. They supplement the options in 
the Player's Handbook and are more 
rare in the worlds of D&D than the 
races in that book are. 
ff you're a player, consult with your DM before using 
any of the races here. Many DMs like to consider the im-
Jiications for their world before adding a new race. Your 
DM may say yes or no to you using a race or may modifiy 
· in some way. 
The following races are detailed in this chapter: 
Aasimar are humanoids with an angelic spark in their 
souls, which grants them supernatural power. 
Fubolgs are forest guardians who prefer peaceful meth-
ods to protect their homes but take up arms they must. 
Goliaths are hulking wanderers who dwell at the high-
est mountain reaches. 
Kenku are cursed bird folk, who still pay the price for 
an ancient betrayal. Dwelling in human cities, they 
have a sinister reputation for working as criminals. 
Lizardfolk sometimes venture from their swamp homes 
in search of treasure and glory. Inscrutable to their 
mammalian companions, they prove to be stout allies. 
Tabaxi are curious cat folk, who have journeyed from 
their distant homeland in search of interesting trea-
sures and lore. 
Tritons are guardians of the ocean depths, who some-
times join people on land in the battle against evil. 
The chapter also includes a section of monstrous char-
acter options that a DM can add to a campaign: bug-
bear, goblin, hobgoblin, kobold, ore, and yuan-ti pure-
blood, the stories of which are explored in chapter 1. 
At the end of the chapter is a section that you can use 
to determine the height and weight of a character who is 
a member of one of the races in this chapter. 
If you're the DM, including any of these races in your 
campaign is a storytelling opportunity, a chance for you 
to decide the roles that different peoples play in the tales 
you weave. You might decide that a race in this chapter 
is common in your world, that only a few members of 
it still live, or that it doesn't exist at all. Whatever you 
decide about the races, consider how they can enhance 
your stories.

AASIMAR 
-
I SAW HER, WREATHED IN WINGS OF PURE LIGHT, HER 
eyes blazing with the fury of the gods. The bone devils 
stopped in their tracks, shielding their faces. Her blade, 
now a brand of light, swept once, twice, three times. The 
devils' heads hit the ground, one after another. And thus we 
learned that an aasimar traveled in our ragtag band. 
-Geldon Parl, Of the 1yranny of Dragons 
Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heav-
ens. They are descended from humans with a touch of 
the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many 
lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as cham-
pions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. 
They are a people of otherworldly visages, with lumi-
nous features that reveal their celestial heritage. 
CELESTIAL CHAMPIONS 
Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians 
of law and good. Their patrons expect them to strike at 
evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice. 
From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and 
guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These 
dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of des-
tiny and a desire for righteousness. 
Each aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of 
the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an 
angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world. 
HIDDEN WANDERERS 
While aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically 
prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws 
the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of 
good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celes-
tial champion if they had the chance. 
When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, 
and other gear that allows them to conceal their iden-
tities. They nevertheless have no compunction about 
striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never 
worth endangering the innocent. 
AASIMAR GUIDES 
An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has 
a link to an angelic being. That being-usually a deva-
provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connec-
tion functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is 
not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, 
the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings. 
The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance 
is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and 
good, and it might have insight into combating espe-
cially powerful evils that it knows about. 
As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider 
the nature of that character's angelic guide. The Angelic 
Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use 
to flesh out your character's guide. 
NOTE TO THE OM: PLAYING AN ANGELIC GUIDE 
As DM, you take on the role of an aasimar's angetic 
guide and decide what kind of advice or omens to send 
In dreams. 
The deva, or other celestial being, is your chance to add 
special roleplaying opportunities to the game. Remember, 
a deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva 
might not understand the compromises and hard choices 
that mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva, 
an aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high, 
sometimes inflexible standards.

CONFLICTED SOULS 
Despite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and 
possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained 
path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. 
These disaffected aasimar are typically content to 
turn away from the world, but a few become agents of 
evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers 
amounted to little more than brainwashing. 
Evil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power 
they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, 
draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them. 
Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes 
feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide 
them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar 
who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a 
drought might be told by an angelic guide to push for-
ward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few 
commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult 
of Orcus. An aasimar's guide is wise but not infallible. 
AASIMAR NAMES 
Most aasimar are born from human parents, and 
they use the same naming conventions as their na-
tive culture.
