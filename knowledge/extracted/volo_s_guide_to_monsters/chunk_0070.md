oxen or cattle but are much more ferocious (see appen-
dix B for their statistics). By doing so they honor the 
creatures as well as their deity, because legends tell that 
Bahgtru also rode a great bull into battle. No ore will eat 
or harm one of these sacred beasts, which are believed 
to be imbued with Bahgtru's spirit. 
LUTHIC, "THE CAVE MOTHER" 
While Gruumsh is the external force that pushes the 
ores to victory over their enemies, it is the influence of 
Luthic, his wife, that binds them together and makes the 
ores internally cohesive. She is the force that keeps the 
explosive rage of Gruumsh from bursting the ores apart. 
If it was not for the followers of Luthic, it is possible that 
the race of ores would be no more than small bands of 
warrior-nomads, scratching out a meager existence, 
rather than a force capable of great destruction. 
Far from the den's war hearth, within the protective 
depths of the caves, the followers of Luthic tend the ore 
brood, raising them to be strong and cruel like their pro-
genitors. By invoking the power of superstitions, omens, 
and traditions, these claws of Luthic hold the tribe to-
gether through ritual, fear and, if necessary, force. 
Talons of the Bear. Luthic is often thought to take 
the guise of an enormous cave bear. Her followers 
honor this aspect of her by keeping cave bears as pets to 
guard the whelping pens that are filled with squabbling 
young. Luthic's devoted also grow their claws long and 
paint them black to mimic the fearsome talons of their 
goddess. Luthic rewards them by making their claws as 
strong and tough as iron. 
Holding the Fort. Along with protecting the young 
and the tribe's food stores, the worshipers of Luthic 
also serve as the crafters, engineers, and builders of an 
ore tribe. They fashion crude weapons, armor, and the 
few manufactured items that the ores need for daily life. 
When the tribe is away on raids, they are expected to dig 
deeper into the caverns of the den to create more living 
space for the ever-increasing population. 
YURTRUS, "THE WHITE HAND" 
Yurtrus is often depicted as consumed by rot and cov-
ered in oozing pustules, utterly repulsive except for his 
hands, which are pure white and free of any blemish. 
Yurtrus has no mouth and never utters a sound, so that 
he may come in absolute silence for his chosen. 
The followers ofYurtrus are allowed to dwell on the 
fringes of the tribe, but are looked upon with distaste 
and unease. They interact with the tribe mostly on occa-
sions of death, claiming the bones of fallen warriors to 
add to the ossuary shrines of Yurtrus, and sometimes 
during shamanic rites when contact with spirits occurs. 
The White Hands. Shamans who heed the telepathic 
whispers ofYurtrus walk the perilous line between the 
living and the dead, and gain uncanny powers from do-
ing so. Through this nonverbal communion, they begin 
to comprehend how to use the magic of death. These 
shamans, known as White Hands, cover their hands in 
white ash or wear pale gloves made of elf skin to sym-
bolize their connection to the power of Yurtrus. The 
necromancy practiced by the shamans ofYurtrus is a 
force considered taboo by ores, which makes them both 
revered and feared by the rest of the tribe. 
Traffickers of the Dead. Ores who die "a good death" 
are sent to Gruumsh by the priests ofYurtrus. The 
priests seek out the bodies of such fallen heroes and 
sever their heads, boil or smoke them to rid them of 
most of the flesh, and then use a ritual punch to break 
out the bridge of the nose and leave the skull with a sin-
gle eye. Ores that appreciate the strength and ferocity of 
a foe might choose to honor that enemy by giving it the 
same treatment. The bodies of ores that die in a failed 
battle are left behind; they were weak and don't deserve 
to join Gruumsh. Those that die of old age have typically 
already been taken into Yurtrus's fold, and their bones 
are used to build furnishings and structures in the area 
of the lair dedicated to the worship of Yurtrus. 
Chosen ofYurtrus. Ores that suffer from gruesome 
diseases are brought into Yurtrus's fold and tended like 
prized cattle. These ores are called nurtured ones, and 
they are considered the chosen of Yurtrus because they 
have been picked for the special purpose of spreading 
his virulent message among the enemy. At night, or 
during a heavy fog, these infected ores rush toward an 
enemy's encampment, often through a hail of arrows, in 
order to spread their affliction within their foe's ranks. 
SHARGAAS, "THE NIGHT LORD" 
Shargaas is a god of darkness and the unknown. He is a 
secretive and murderous deity, dangerous to all except 
Gruumsh. His'realm is the darkness that no creatures 
but those devoted to him can see through. 
To other ores, the followers of Shargaas are depraved 
and twisted creatures that have no honor and skulk in 
the shadows. Rejected by Yurtrus as too unsuitable to 
serve as custodians of the dead, these ores live even 
deeper inside the lair, close to where the entrance to 
Shargaas's realm is located. There in the darkness, ores 
exiled to meet their fate are either brought into the fold 
as members of the tribe's Shargaas cult, or are torn to 
pieces and devoured as sacrificial tributes by the wor-
shipers of the Night Lord. 
Culling the Weak. Although most followers of Shar-
gaas are exiles, living in the farthest reaches of the lair 
away from the rest of the tribe, others remain within the 
main body, posing as ordinary warriors. These agents 
single out the weakest members of the fighting force, 
because removing these weak links strengthens the rest 
of the group. Soon after being born, an ore must be able 
to show that it will grow into a capable warrior, or else 
it will be visited by the cultists of Shargaas. The cultists 
also waylay ores that have proved themselves ineffectual 
in leadership or combat, then drag them into Shargaas's 
dark caverns to be ritually murdered and devoured. 
This culling of the weak and the unworthy is accepted 
as necessary by the tribe, but speaking about it is taboo.
