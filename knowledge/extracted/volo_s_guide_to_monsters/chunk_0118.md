FIRE NEWTS 
In regions that contain hot springs, volcanic activity, 
or similar hot and wet conditions, firenewts might be 
found. These humanoid amphibians live in a milita-
ristic theocracy that reveres elemental fire in its worst 
incarnation. 
Heat Seekers. Firenewts need hot water to live and 
breed. A firenewt becomes sluggish, mentally and phys-
ically, after spending a week away from an external 
source of moist heat. A prolonged lack of heat can shut 
down a firenewt community, as the creatures within go 
into hibernation and their eggs stop developing. 
Firenewts delve for sources of heat in the earth, such 
as boiling mud and hot springs, that make ideal places 
to settle. Through excavation and mining in the area, 
they fashion living space and obtain an ample supply 
of minerals for other uses, such as smelting, smithing, 
and alchemy. A firenewt lair features a network of 
channels and sluices to circulate hot liquid through the 
settlement. 
The alchemy practiced by firenewts focuses on fire. 
One of their favorite mixtures is a paste of sulfur, min-
eral salts, and oil. Firenewts chew this blend habitually, 
because doing so produces a pleasant internal heat and 
it enables a firenewt to vomit forth a small ball of flame. 
Most firenewts carry a container with this mixture in it. 
Reli;ious Militants. Firenewt society and culture are 
based on the worship of Imix, the Prince of Evil Fire. 
This veneration of Imix leads firenewts to be aggressive, 
wrathful, and cruel. Firenewt warlocks of Imix teach 
that by demonstrating these qualities, a firenewt warrior 
in combat can become "touched by the Fire Lord," enter-
ing a nearly unstoppable battle rage. 
Warlocks of I mix command warriors to prove their 
worth by going on raids to bring back treasure and cap-
tives. The warlocks take the choicest loot as a tithe to 
Imix, and then those who participated in the raid divide 
the rest according to merit. Prisoners that have no ap-
parent usefulness are sacrificed to Imix and then eaten. 
Those that are deemed capable of mining and perform-
ing other chores around the lair are kept as slaves for a 
while before meeting the same fate. 
When firenewts muster for war, rather than merely 
staging occasional raids, they take no prisoners. Their 
goal is nothing less than the annihilation of their foes-
and they reserve their greatest animosity for others of 
their kind. If two groups of firenewts come upon each 
other, it's likely that they're in competition for the same 
territory, and a bloody battle is the usual result. 
Giant Striders. Firenewts have a close relationship 
with a type of monstrous beast they believe Imix sent 
to aid them- borne out by the creatures' ability to send 
a gout of flame against distant enemies. Called giant 
striders, these monsters appear birdlike and reptilian, 
but are truly neither. Firenewts provide shelter, food, 
and breeding grounds in their lairs for giant striders, 
and the striders voluntarily serve as mounts for elite fire-
newt soldiers.
