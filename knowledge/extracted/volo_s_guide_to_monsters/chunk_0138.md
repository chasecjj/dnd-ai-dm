KOBOLDS 
Some kobolds have gifts bequeathed to them by dragons 
or gods, enabling them to rise above their peers. Others 
are born with a cruel inventiveness that few can match. 
KOBOLD DRAGONSHIELD 
A kobold dragonshield is a champion of its race. Almost 
all dragonshields begin life as normal kobolds, then are 
chosen by a dragon and invested with great powers for 
the purpose of protecting the dragon's eggs, but once 
every few years a kobold hatches with an innate version 
of the dragonshield's abilities. Accomplished at hand-to-
hand combat, it bears many scars from desperate fights 
and carries a shield made out of cast-off dragon scales. 
Uncommon Courage. A dragonshield knows that it 
has a place of honor in the tribe, but-being kobolds at 
heart-most of them feel unworthy of their status and 
thus desperate to prove themselves deserving of it. A 
dragonshield's natural kobold cowardice is still present 
in its makeup, and thus it might still run away from a 
threat. But it also has the ability to rally in the face of 
certain death, inspiring other kobolds to follow it in a 
charge against the invaders of their warren. 
KOBOLD INVENTOR 
A kobold inventor, crafty and with quick hands, builds 
improvised weapons in the hope of gaining some new 
advantage in combat. An inventor captures bugs, scoops 
up exotic dungeon slimes, and claims the best stolen 
goods as ingredients in its experiments. Its creations 
are sometimes comical in appearance, but- like ko-
bolds' traps- they work a lot better than their materials 
would suggest. 
Good While They Last. An inventor's new weapons 
last for only one or two attacks before they break, but 
might be surprisingly effective in the meantime. Most 
inventors are skilled enough that their improvised weap-
ons don't backfire on them, but other users might not be 
so lucky. The weapons don't have to be lethal-in many 
cases one serves its purpose if it distracts, scares, or 
confuses a creature long enough for other kobolds to kill 
the enemy. In any particular encounter, an inventor usu-
ally has one or two improvised weapons at its disposal. 
KOBOLD SCALE SORCERER 
A kobold scale sorcerer has an innate talent for arcane 
magic, making it a highly valuable member of the tribe 
for several reasons. Because the kobolds' deity remains 
imprisoned, most tribes lack individuals that can use 
divine magic, and so the scale sorcerers fill the roles of 
advisor and historian. In times of peace, they use their 
spells to fortify and enhance the warren and aid the rest 
of the tribe. When the tribe is threatened, a scale sor-
cerer lashes out with fire and poison against enemies, 
saving a bit of magic for itself in case it needs to flee or 
take advantage of a captor. 
Duty-Bound to a Dragan. In a kobold tribe associated 
with a dragon, typically one that resides in or near the 
dragon's lair, the scale sorcerer also serves as diplomat 
and mouthpiece- anticipating the dragon's needs, issu-

Dragon's Resistance. The kobold has resistance to a type of 
damage based on the color of dragon that invested it with 
power (choose or roll a dlO): 1- 2, acid (black); 3- 4, cold 
(white); 5-6, fire (red); 7-8, lightning (blue); 9-10, poi-
son (green). 
Heart of the Dragon. If the kobold is frightened or paralyzed 
by an effect that allows a saving throw, it can repeat the save 
at the start of its turn to end the effect on itself and all kobolds 
within 30 feet of it. Any kobold that benefits from this trait (in-
cluding the dragonshield) has advantage on its next attack roll. 
Pack Tactics. The kobold has advantage on an attack roll 
against a creature if at least one of the kobold's allies is within 
5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated. 
Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the kobold has disad-
vantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks that rely on sight. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The kobold makes two melee attacks. 
Spear. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or 
range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (ld6 + 1) piercing damage, or 
5 (ld8 + 1) piercing damage ifused with two hands to make a
