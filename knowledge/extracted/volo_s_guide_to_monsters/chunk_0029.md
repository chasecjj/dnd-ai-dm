Gnolls wander the land continually in search of new 
victims, rarely sleeping and never settling down. Only 
a large-scale assault, such as the massacre of an entire 
village, can satisfy their desire even temporarily. A sated 
gnoll rests, knowing that it has pleased Yeenoghu. Its 
relief is short, no more than a few days, before the gnoll 
once again becomes a slave to its desires. 
Strength, hunger, and fear are the three concepts that 
every gnoll extols. Strength allows a gnoll to overwhelm, 
kill, and devour a foe. Hunger motivates a gnoll to go 
forth and slay in Yeenoghu's name. Fear is a weapon 
used against enemies to make them easy prey. In con-
cert, all three play a role in advancing Yeenoghu's goals. 
OMENS FROM BEYOND 
Of all the demon lords, Yeenoghu is perhaps the most 
active on the Material Plane. He shows support to his 
followers by sending them omens in the form of visions, 
dreams, and signs. As such, gnolls instinctively look for 
such omens to guide their activities, and they find them 
in many places. 
Among the signs that gnolls rely on are the blood 
trails and spatters left behind after making a meal of 
an intelligent humanoid. They attach significance to a 
number of other phenomena as well, including the sight 
of arrows in flight, the rush of the wind, and sounds 
of howling or cackling laughter that have no discern-
ible source. 
NON-ONOLL CULTISTS 
Few creatures aside from gnolls worship Yeenoghu, and 
those that do mimic gnolls in their actions and beliefs. 
Yeenoghu's cultists are folk who lack all hope and have 
descended into nihilism. One might have suffered a tre-
mendous personal loss, been banished from its home, or 
been the victim of a terrible betrayal. Whatever the rea-
son, the would-be cultist is left isolated and abandoned, 
making it vulnerable to Yeenoghu's teachings. 
The creature's thoughts and dreams are plagued 
by visions sent by Yeenoghu. The promise of ultimate 
power, fueled by acts of brutality, tempt and torment it. 
Most folk ascribe these feelings to a fleeting bout of de-
pression or madness and are able to resist the call to vi-
olence, but a few cannot. For these rare individuals, the 
true lure ofYeenoghu's promises lies not in the power 
they offer, but in the deep sense of belonging they create. 
Those that are swayed by this offer consider them-
selves gnolls in mind and deed, and soon set out to 
commit their first atrocities in Yeenoghu's name. Most of 
these cultists are almost as quickly killed by guards or 
other authorities. A few escape into the wilderness and 
continue to rampage on their own, perhaps eventually 
falling in league with a gnoll war band. 
GNOLL TACTICS 
Gnolls might seem to throw themselves into battle 
mindlessly, driven only by fury and hunger, but they do 
possess a rudimentary form of cunning that is borne out 
by several tactics they use consistently.
