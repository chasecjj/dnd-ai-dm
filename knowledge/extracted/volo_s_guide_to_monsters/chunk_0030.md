BUTCHER THE WEAK 
Gnolls seek only to kill, and as such prefer to deal with 
weak, easy targets. An enemy that can fight back is an 
enemy to save for later. Gnolls have no sense of honor, 
glory, or individual achievement. They care only for the 
raw number of creatures they can slay. In the face of a 
gnoll incursion, it is best for refugees to seek shelter in 
castles and other fortified positions. Gnolls avoid pro-
tracted battles if they can, much preferring to slaughter 
those that can't defend themselves. 
OVERWHELM THE STRONG 
Gnolls attack intelligent prey that is capable of resisting 
them only when the most powerful omens from Yee-
noghu compel them to do so. They cooperate to gang 
up on each of the individuals in a group of explorers or 
adventurers, or if the prey is more numerous they rush 
forward in waves. The creatures will crawl over their 
own dead to climb a castle's walls and kill all within it. 
A commonly held belief is that a fortress besieged by 
gnolls needs ten arrows for each one to keep the crea-
tures from scaling the walls. 
SPREAD FAR AND WIDE 
Gnolls never set up permanent camps, though they 
might linger for a few days at the site of a particularly 
great slaughter as they devour the corpses of both their 
victims and the gnolls killed in battle. During this time, 
the hyenas that follow a pack of gnolls feast until they 
become bloated, then burst open to spawn more gnolls. 
In this manner, gnolls replenish their ranks before wan-
dering off in ragged bands to continue their rampage. 
KILL FROM A DISTANCE 
Almost every gnoll carries a bow scavenged from a past 
victim. Gnolls use ranged attacks mainly to prevent their 
prey from fleeing, rather than softening up their targets 
with an initial barrage of arrows before an assault. A 
target wounded by a bow shot becomes easy prey for 
any gnolls near it. Some particularly clever gnolls have 
been known to use bur_ning arrows to spark fires, cut-
ting off their prey's escape routes and driving victims 
into their jaws. 
LEAVE No SURVIVORS 
A band of gnolls lives in a state of eternal war with ev-
erything it encounters, aside from fellow worshipers of 
Yeenoghu. To keep from being detected between major 
raids, the gnolls move through the wilderness with as 
much stealth as they can marshal. They never leave sur-
vivors in any group they set upon, and will pursue a flee-
ing enemy for days to prevent it from getting to a town or 
a city and raising an alarm. 
If the area they hunt in becomes too well-defended, 
the gnolls relocate in search of easier prey. Large tracts 
along the fringe of civilization might be devastated be-
fore the wider world becomes aware of a gnoll threat. 
TREASURE 
A cautious and skilled gang can follow in the tracks of a 
gnoll war band, keeping hidden and waiting for the crea-
tures to move on after ravaging a village or a town. The 
ON DEFEATING GNOLLS 
An excerpt from One Hundred Years of War, a famous man-
ual of dwarven battle tactics: 
Gnolls remain a threat across all seasons. Happily, our 
redoubts are too fortified for their tastes, but caravans, 
foraging expeditions, and patrols must deal with them. 
Gnolls take care to move quietly when they are on the 
hunt for prey. The events that presage their presence are 
easy to misinterpret as the results of other threats. A scout 
might go missing, a caravan fail to arrive on time, or a 
village be left deserted. Several kinds of creatures, such as 
ores and goblins, can cause such events, but the evidence 
that gnolls leave of their involvement is unmistakable. 
Their enemies aren't merely killed, they are dismembered 
and devoured. The loot that other marauders would scoop 
up is left where it falls, of no use to a creature that requires 
only flesh to feed its urges. 
If you suspect that gnolls are encroaching on dwarven 
territory, send reliable spies to human settlements in the 
region, while pulling back as many of our folk as you can 
manage. Instruct the spies to pass along updates each day, 
preferably by messenger bird. Do not tell the spies of your 
suspicions. Invent a story, such as the search for an outlaw 
or some other deception. 
If a spy fails to report, you must strike quickly. Send your 
fastest warriors and strongest spellcasters to the spy's lo-
cation. If the gnolls have struck a settlement, they will rest 
for up to a week, bloated on their kills. In this state, they 
are their most vulnerable. Surround the place in silence, 
and advance as one to catch them in a vise. Let none sur-
vive. A single gnoll can, over time, create a new war band. 
Some may argue for an approach that doesn't rely on 
the loss of human life to see it succeed. I would gladly 
suggest one if such existed. Your best strategy is to defend 
our halls and let the humans serve as bait. Moradin knows 
they multiply quickly enough that their losses will soon 
be recouped. 
gnolls leave the town's gold and gems and other durable 
goods battered and gnawed, but still intact, though they 
invariably ruin delicate or flammable objects in their fits 
of destruction. 
Gnolls do possess a basic understanding of the value of 
weapons and armor, so one might decide to hold onto an 
object seen as useful. In this way, a gnoll might come to 
possess a magic item, though it might not know exactly 
how to use it. Gnolls regard objects of "treasure" only in 
terms of their ability to cause harm or preserve a gnoll's 
life. Everything else is fit only for destruction. 
LANGUAGE 
The language of gnolls, such as it is, consists of whines, 
cackles, and howls mixed with gestures and expres-
sions. Gnolls use it to communicate only basic concepts, 
such as an alert about approaching prey or a call to their 
allies to join the fray. When gnolls fight among them-
selves, they rarely bother with threats or words before 
leaping at each other's throats. 
When gnoll leaders must share complex concepts 
with each other, they use a broken form of Abyssal 
gifted to them by Yeenoghu. The gnoll language lacks a 
script or written form, though elite gnolls can use their 
limited knowledge of Abyssal to leave messages. In 
most cases, though, a gnoll war band has little use for
