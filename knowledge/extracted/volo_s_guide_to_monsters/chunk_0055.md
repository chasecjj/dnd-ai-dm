DRAGON SERVITORS 
Kobolds believe that they were created by Tiamat from 
the blood of dragons-a view supported by their reptil-
ian (they would say draconic) appearance. In every ko-
bold tribe, the legend of the creatures' origin is passed 
down from elder to hatchling, giving each individual and 
every generation a reason to feel pride and self-respect. 
The kobolds prefer to run away than fight, to live off the 
scraps of others, and they are often dominated by larger 
humanoids, but they know that there is greatness within 
them and they are proud that they were chosen to be the 
blood-kin of dragons. 
Kobolds willingly serve chromatic dragons and wor-
ship them as if they were demigods- mighty beings of 
divine descent. This isn't a casual sort of worship or lip 
service; kobolds are awed in the presence of a dragon, 
as if an actual avatar of a deity were in their presence. 
Kobolds fall all over themselves to obey orders from a 
dragon, even if they are dangerous orders. Although 
kobolds usually don't worship Tiamat directly, they rec-
ognize her as the dragon-goddess of all chromatic drag-
ons, and as the master of their racial god, Kurtulmak. 
KURTULMAIC: Goo OF KOBOLDS 
The god ofkobolds was a vassal ofTiamat. When the 
gnome god Gari Glittergold stole a treasure from Tiamat's 
hoard, she sent Kurtulmak to retrieve it. Gari lured his 
pursuer into a maze-like cavern, then collapsed the exits 
behind him, trapping Kurtulmak for all eternity. 
Kurtulmak is a hateful deity, one who despises all Me 
except for kobolds. He especially hates Gari Glittergold, 
gnomes, and fey creatures that enjoy playing pranks. He 
taught the first kobolds how to mine, tunnel, hide, and 
ambush. He is dominated by his emotions- intelligent, 
but not wise. Arrogant and prone to gloating, he carries 
grudges, has a huge chip on his shoulder, and spends a 
lot oftime fashioning elaborate revenge scenarios against 
those who have disrespected him. 
ARCANE MAGIC USERS 
Unlike some other humanoids, kobolds don't fear or 
shun arcane magic. They see magic as part of their con-
nection to dragons, and are proud to be blessed with the 
ability to wield such power. Young kobold sorcerers are 
trained by elders, and the training has an almost reli-
gious significance. Most kobold sorcerers are of the dra-
conic bloodline origin and specialize in either damaging 
magic (which can also be used in mining), augmentation 
(of materials or allies), or divination (to find raw materi-
als and foresee threats to the tribe). 
The main reason why kobolds depend on arcane 
magic rather than divine is Kurtulmak's imprisonment, 
which makes it difficult for him to grant spells to mortals 
and for those mortals to receive his favor. Furthermore, 
kobolds are so frail that a single hit from a human's 
weapon can kill one of them, so a tribe has little use 
for healing magic, and a sorcerer can meet most of the 
tribe's other magic-related needs. Kobold shamans are 
very rare; priests of Kurtulmak, when they reveal them-
selves, are easily recognized by orange garb (usually just 
a roughly tom sash or cloak) decorated with an image of 
a gnome's skull. 
LIFE AND OUTLOOK 
Kobolds have a tribal society in which they all take on 
specialized roles that protect and sustain the tribe. 
The strongest kobolds are trained to be hunters and 
warriors, the most clever are crafters and strategists, 
the toughest are miners and beast-wranglers, and so 
on. Even a stupid or physically weak kobold is given a 
role in the tribe, whether something as simple as pick-
ing mushrooms for food or watching over hatchlings, 
and they all understand that their actions contribute 
to the survival of the group. The tribe practices for the 
eventuality of defending the lair against intruders, and 
their plans always include knowing the best escape
