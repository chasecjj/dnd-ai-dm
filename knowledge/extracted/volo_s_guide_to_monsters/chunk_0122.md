Dual Shields. The giant carries two shields, each of which is ac-
counted for in the giant's AC. The giant must stow or drop one 
of its shields to hurl rocks. 
ACTIONS 
Multiatta,k. The giant makes two fireshield attacks. 
Fireshield. Melee Weapon Atta,k: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 22 (4d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire 
damage plus 7 (2d6) piercing damage. 
Ro,k. Ranged Weapon Atta,k: +13 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one 
target. Hit: 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. 
Shield Charge. The giant moves up to 30 feet in a straight line 
and can move through the space of any creature smaller than 
Huge. The first time it enters a creature's space during this 
move, it makes a fireshield attack against that creature. If the 
attack hits, the target must also succeed on a DC 21 Strength 
saving throw or be pushed ahead of the giant for the rest of 
this move. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also 
knocked prone and takes 18 (3d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage, or 
29 (6d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage if it was already prone.

Weapons of War. Dreadnoughts are massively pow-
erful fire giants who wield two huge shields like plow 
blades. These shields bear spikes on their exterior and 
have hollow interiors into which the dreadnought pours 
hot coals at the first sign of danger. Armed with its two 
shields, the dreadnought can present a fiery wall to any 
attacker. When the dreadnought has finished, often all 
that is left of a foe is a smoking smear on the floor. 
When not called on to fight, dreadnoughts maintain 
their strength by using their shields to shove huge quan-
tities of coal, stone, or ore about the foundry. Occasion-
ally, dreadnoughts are called on by their superiors to ac-
company a war or diplomatic delegation, The presence 
of the dreadnoughts presents a fierce face in either case. 
FROST GIANT EVERLASTING ONE 
To hold its place or rise within the ordning, a frost giant 
must routinely face mighty foes in single combat. Some 
seek out magic that will aid them, but enchanted objects 
can be taken or lost. True greatness relies on personal 
prowess. Faced with this truth, a frost giant might seek 
a supernatural gift from Vaprak the Destroyer. 
Troll Eater. Frost giants mainly turn to Vaprak, a ra-
pacious god of strength and hunger worshiped by ogres 
and trolls, out of desperation. Vaprak likes to tempt frost 
giants with dreams of glory followed by nightmares 
of bloody cannibalism. Those who don't shrink from 
such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive 
more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these 
dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll 
upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet it in 
secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in 
Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined 
frost giants can finish such a gory feast. 
Vaprak's Blessing. After devouring the troll sent by 
Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlast-
ing one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and 
a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost 
giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend 
off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't 
give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's vi-
sions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, often 
resulting in discolored skin, warty scars, and vestigial 
body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even extra 
heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden 
then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by 
its clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting 
ones gather and even reproduce, passing the "blessing" 
and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.
