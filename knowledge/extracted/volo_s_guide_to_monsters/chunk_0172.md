YUAN-TI 
Yuan-ti malisons who become priestly devotees of a 
particular god- be it Sseth, Dendar the Night Serpent, 
or Merrshaulk- often rise through the ranks to become 
spiritual leaders among the serpent folk. These priests 
perform sacrificial rites to appease their vile gods. 
Also described here are the degenerate yuan-ti brood-
guard and the horrifying yuan-ti anathema. 
Y UAN-TI A NATHEMA 
A yuan-ti abomination's quest for godhood might lead it 
to perform a ritual that, if successful, transforms it into 
an even greater form: a yuan-ti anathema. This ritual de-
mands the sacrifice of hundreds of snakes and requires 
the abomination to bathe in the blood of its enemies. 
The transformation is quick yet painful. 
Not all yuan-ti are eager to see one of their own be-
come an anathema, since anathemas brutally subjugate 
their lessers for their own evil ends. 
Not Quite Divine. An anathema considers itself a 
demigod on the path to greater divinity. It demands obei-
sance from weaker yuan-ti and uses every resource at

Innate Spel/casting (Anathema Form Only). The anathema's 
innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). It 
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material 
components: 
At will: animal friendship (snakes only) 
3/day each: darkness, entangle.fear, haste, suggestion, polymorph 
1/day: divine word 
Magic Resistance. The anathema has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. 
Ophidiophobia Aura. Any creature of the anathema's choice, 
other than a snake or a yuan-ti, that starts its turn within 30 
feet of the anathema and can see or hear it must succeed on a 
DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of snakes 
and yuan-ti. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at 
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a suc-
cess. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends 
for it, the target is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours. 
Shapechanger. The anathema can use its action to polymorph 
into a Huge giant constrictor snake, or back into its true form. 
Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is 
wearing or carrying isn't transformed. 
Six Heads. The anathema has advantage on Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, 
charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked 
unconscious.
