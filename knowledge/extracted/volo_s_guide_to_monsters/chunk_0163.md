Regeneration. The spawn ofKyuss regains 10 hit points at the 
start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight 
-----,;::,::,;;;~~;,:a;;;~~~~ee;,--, or a body of running water. If the spawn takes acid, fire, or 
radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the 
spawn's next turn. The spawn is destroyed only if it starts its 
turn with O hit points and doesn't regenerate. 
SPAWN OF KYUSS 
Kyuss was a high priest of Orcus who plundered 
corpses from necropolises to create the first spawn 
of Kyuss. Even centuries after Kyuss's death, his mad 
disciples continue performing the horrific rites he 
perfected. 
PlaAue of Worms. From a distance or in poor light, 
a spawn of Kyuss looks like an ordinary zombie. As 
it comes into clearer view, one can see scores of little 
green worms crawling in and out of it. These worms 
jump onto nearby humanoids and burrow into their 
flesh. A worm that penetrates a humanoid body makes 
its way to the creature's brain. Once inside the brain, the 
worm kills its host and animates the corpse, transform-
ing it into a spawn of Kyuss that breeds more worms. 
The dead humanoid's soul remains trapped inside the 
corpse, preventing the individual from being raised or 
resurrected until the undead body is destroyed. The hor-
ror of being a soul imprisoned in an undead body drives 
a spawn of Kyuss insane. 
Corruption Without End. Spaw~ of Kyuss are ex-
pressions of Orcus's intent to replace all life with un-
death. Left to its own devices, a solitary spawn of Kyuss 
travels aimlessly. If it stumbles across a living creature, 
the spawn attacks with the sole intent of creating more 
spawn. Whether they are dispersed or clustered, spawn 
reproduce exponentially if nothing stops them. 
Undead Nature. Spawn of Kyuss require no air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
Worms. If the spawn of Kyuss is targeted by an effect that cures 
disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither 
away, and it loses its Burrowing Worm action. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The spawn of Kyuss makes two attacks with its 
claws and uses Burrowing Worm. 
Burrowing Worm. A worm launches from the spawn of Kyuss 
at one humanoid that the spawn can see within 10 feet ofit. 
The worm latches onto the target's skin unless the target suc-
ceeds on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. The worm is a Tiny 
undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, 
and a speed ofl foot. While on the target's skin, the worm can 
be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the 
spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a 
humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, 
the worm burrows under the target's skin at the end of the 
target's next turn, dealing 1 piercing damage to it. At the end 
of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic 
damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 10d6). A worm-in-
fested target dies if it drops to O hit points, then rises 10 min-
utes later as a spawn of Kyuss. If a worm-infested creature is 
targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all 
the worms infesting it wither away. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach S ft., one target. 
Hit: 6 (ld6 + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
