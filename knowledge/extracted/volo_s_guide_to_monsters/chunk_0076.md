The ore stronghold ~picted and described here is an 
example of such a place, which could suit the needs of 
a tribe for several years or even decades. It has several 
subterranean chambers, conveniently configured to pro-
vide every group of worshipers with appropriate quar-
ters, and it is accessible from the surface through only 
one well-guarded passageway. 
MAIN CHAMBER 
The warriors that worship Gruumsh and Ilneval oc-
cupy the main area of the complex, a large cavern that 
has the war hearth at its center and a shrine to Ilneval 
along the perimeter. The focal point of the shrine is a 
blood-covered sword mounted on the wall. 
The area also includes a pile of broken femurs that 
represents a shrine to Bahgtru. The worshipers of 
Bahgtru are mostly young, brash ore warriors, eager 
to prove their strength and bravery to the elders of the 
tribe. Even if space is available in the stronghold, they 
often live outside the entrance in crude bivouacs and 
roughshod fortifications, protecting their elders by 
guarding the stronghold's vulnerable spot. 
Off to one side of the chamber, away from where the 
warriors are quartered, is the fighting pit, a sunken and 
fenced-off area where ores settle their differences or en-
gage in contests of strength. 
WAR CHIEF'S QUARTERS 
Adjacent to the main chamber is the room where the 
war chief resides, holds council, and hands out bless-
ings or punishments from Gruumsh. The best loot and 
trophies of triumph are piled in this room and consid-
ered to be the property of the chief. A fire, not as large as 
the war hearth, burns in its center. 
Next to the chiefs enclosed sleeping area is a shrine 
to Gruumsh consisting of a crude stone effigy of He Who 
Watches, surrounded by bloody offerings. 
CAVES FOR FOLLOWERS OF LUTHIC 
Ores who worship Luthic are sequestered in a cavern off 
the main chamber, where they protect the young and su-
pervise food stores. These ores take control of prisoners 
brought back from raids, using them as slave labor to 
dig out new living space and do other menial tasks. 
Most of Luthic's faithful reside in this area, close to 
the whelping pens where young ores are kept until they 
grow old enough to contribute to the tribe. When they're 
not being worked, slaves are housed in a small adjoining 
chamber and watched over by a group of cave bears that 
Luthic's worshipers keep as pets. 
Many of Luthic's priestesses have their quarters in 
a nearby cavern that holds the tribe's shrine to Luthic. 
She is represented by a crude stone statue with claws 
covered in charcoal and a body smeared with red ochre. 
CAVES FOR FOLLOWERS OF YURTRUS 
Followers of Yurtrus reside on the threshold of where 
the deep area of the cavern system begins. They are 
the keepers of the dead, and the entrance to their realm 
is festooned with piles of bones and skulls. An altar to 
Yurtrus, made of stone with a hand painted in ash and 
tallow on it, stands in a cramped chamber apart from 
the main living area that is lined with skulls and bones. 
CAVES FOR FOLLOWERS OF SHARGAAS 
Followers of Shargaas dwell within the most remote 
area of the stronghold, immersed in darkness and 
feared by the rest of the tribe. The tribe's altar to Shar-
gaas is a bloodstained rock. 
The stronghold depicted in the map features a num-
ber of small passages that lead away from the depths 
of the lair and eventually provide egress to the surface. 
The members of the tribe's Shargaas cult, which call 
themselves the Red Fang of Shargaas, take advantage of 
these secret tunnels to raid the outside world and bring 
back prisoners. 
The members of the Red Fang use giant, carnivorous 
bats as mounts, that allow them to gain silent access 
to any location. Those who think they can hide under 
cover of darkness or escape invisibly are easy marks for 
the Red Fang's bats, which locate their prey with high-
pitched clicks and shrieks, then swoop down and snatch 
up their prey with razor sharp claws. 
Bat riders of the Red Fang return from their raids the 
same way they exited-through a crack in the cliff face 
far away from their lair. A tunnel leads through layers of 
damp stone and crystallized minerals before eventually 
opening out into their subterranean domain. Captives 
are used as food for the brood of giant bats that roost in 
the rookery or are kept as slaves to be worked or used 
for barter. 
TREASURE 
Ores are consummate raiders. When they attack and 
overwhelm, they claim as booty anything of value that 
they can carry- and an ore's definition of "value" can be 
very loose indeed. 
The strongest or most dominant ores will always 
claim the best loot after a successful raid, and since the 
pecking order in the group is almost always firmly es-
tablished, there are usually no squabbles over who gets 
what. If the tribe's war wagon is available, it is used to 
transport large or especially treasured items. 
Each ore warrior carries its personal loot from the 
raid in a sack. These are the trophies of victory that ores 
brandish and boast about when they return to the den. 
A loot sack might contain something of demonstrable 
worth or usefulness, something that's edible (or used to 
be), or something that was acquired at great risk. In any 
case, once the bragging is over, the loot is eaten, put to 
use, or otherwise disposed of. 
The Ore Trophies table provides a selection of items 
that might be found in an ore's loot sack.
