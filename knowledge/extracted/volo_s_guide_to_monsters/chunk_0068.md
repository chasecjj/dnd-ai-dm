0RCS: THE (;QDSWORN 
To feel the thunder of orcish war drums outside the gate 
and to hear a chorus of voices growling, "Gruumsh!" 
is the nightmare of every civilized place in the world. 
For no matter how thick its walls, skilled its archers, or 
brave its knights, few settlements have ever withstood a 
full-scale onslaught of ores. 
Every soldier who lives through a fight with ores tells 
of confronting a hulking foe that can cleave through a 
warrior with a single blow, part of a force that can cut 
down enemies as though they were trembling stalks of 
wheat before the scythe. Only a skilled and determined 
hero can hope to survive single combat with an ore. 
Savage and fearless, ore tribes are ever in search of 
elves, dwarves, and humans to destroy. Motivated by 
their hatred of the civilized races of the world and their 
need to satisfy the demands of their deities, the ores 
know that if they fight well and bring glory to their tribe, 
Gruumsh will call them home to the plane of Acheron. It 
is there in the afterlife where the chosen ones will join 
Gruumsh and his armies in their endless extraplanar 
battle for supremacy. 
Gons OF THE 0RC S 
Ores believe their gods to be invincible. They see the 
principles that define them and their deities at work 
every day in the world around them-nature rewards 
the strong and mercilessly eliminates the weak and the 
infirm. Ores don't revere their gods as much as they fear 
them; every tribe has superstitions about how to avert 
their wrath or bring their favor. This deep-seated uncer-
tainty and fear comes forth in the form of savagery and 
relentlessness, as ores ravage and kill to appease the 
gods in order to avoid their terrible retribution. 
At the pinnacle of the ore pantheon is Gruumsh One-
Eye, who created the ores and continues to direct their 
destiny. He is aided and abetted by the other warrior 
deities, Bahgtru and Ilneval, who bring strength and 
cunning to the battlefield. The followers of all three gods 
are a tribe's raiders and ravagers- often the only part of 
an ore tribe that its victims ever see. 
Deep within the den of a tribe, far away from the war-
hearth where warriors gather and celebrate, dwell the 
followers ofYurtrus, the god of disease and death, and 
Shargaas, the god of darkness and the unknown. Ores 
too weak for battle (because of bodily weakness, malfor-
mation, injury, or age) often join these cults instead of 
facing daily humiliation, exile, or death. 
Serving as the bridge between the two parts of the 
tribe are the priestesses of Luthic, the ore goddess who 
represents both life and the grave. It is her worshipers 
that raise young ores to be warriors, and then, at the end 
of their lives, take them to Yurtrus and Shargaas to be 
carried into death and the great unknown. 
GRUUMSH, "HE WHO W ATCHES" 
Gruumsh, the undisputed ruler of the ore pantheon, 
pushes his children to increase their numbers so they 
may be his instrument of revenge against the realms of 
elves, humans, and dwarves. In order to spite the gods 
who spurned him, Gruumsh leads his ores on a mission

of ceaseless slaughter, fueled by an unending rage that 
seeks to lay waste to the civilized world and revel in 
its anguish. 
Ores are naturally chaotic and unorganized, acting on 
their emotions and instincts rather than out of reason 
and logic. Only certain charismatic ores, those who have 
been directly touched by the will and might of Gruumsh, 
have the capacity to control the other ores in a tribe. 
A Chosen Few. Ores don't become renowned in their 
tribes by choosing Gruumsh; he chooses them. An ore 
might claim its allegiance to Gruumsh, but only those 
who have proven themselves through feats of strength 
and ferocity in war are considered worthy of being true 
worshipers. Gruumsh singles out these individuals by 
bestowing upon each one a powerful dream or vision 
that signifies acceptance into his inner circle. 
Those who are visited by Gruumsh are transformed 
psychologically and often physically by the experience. 
Some are driven to the brink of madness, reduced to 
muttering about omens and prophecies, while others 
become imbued with supernatural power and rise to 
positions of leadership. 
NISHREK AND THE ETERNAL WAR 
Ores believe that if they die with honor, their spirits go to 
the plane of Acheron, the Infinite Battlefield-specifically 
the layer ofNishrek, where they join Gruumsh's army and 
fight on his behalf in the endless war against the gobli-
noid followers of Maglubiyet. Gruumsh sees this conflict 
as a chance to pit his people against an eager foe and 
enable them to prove their worth before their deities. He 
relishes every short-term triumph and swears revenge for 
every setback. 
Luthic, though, takes a longer view. She understands the 
cosmic implications of Maglubiyet's attacks. To prevent 
the goblinoids from outstripping her people in population, 
she urges the ores to have many offspring and teach them 
the ways of battle not only for survival in the material 
world, but to keep Maglubiyet at bay in the conflict on the 
planes. Her children will remain in her care, and if need be 
she wouldn't hesitate to take to the field herself and claw 
Maglubiyet's beady eyes from his face to prevent him from 
taking them from her. 
The cosmic battle between the two pantheons has raged 
for eons without resolution, leading those who study its 
ebb and flow to expect the stalemate to continue. A differ-
ent view is put forth by the archmage Tzunk, who notes 
that Maglubiyet has never faced a foe as ferocious and 
protective as Luthic. He predicts that the war will end with 
Luthic the only deity standing, as the cave mother ascends 
to rule her warrior children.
