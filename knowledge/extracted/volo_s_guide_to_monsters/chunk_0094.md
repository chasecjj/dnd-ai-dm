THE CAT LORD 
The deity of the tabaxi is a ficlde entity, as befits the patron 
of cats. The tabaxi believe that the Cat Lord wanders the 
world, watching over them and intervening in their affairs 
as needed. Clerics of the Cat Lord are rare and typically 
access the Trickery domain. 
In the tabaxi's eyes, gathering wealth is like packing 
rations for a long trip. It's important to survive in the 
world, but not worth fussing over. 
Instead, tabaxi value knowledge and new experiences. 
Their ears perk up in a busy tavern, and they tease 
out stories with offers of food, drink, and coin. Tabaxi 
might walk away with empty purses, but they mull 
over the stories and rumors they collected like a miser 
counting coins. 
Although material wealth holds little attraction for the 
tabaxi, they have an insatiable desire to find and inspect 
ancient relics, magical items, and other rare objects. 
Aside from the power such items might confer, a tabaxi 
takes great joy in unraveling the stories behind their cre-
ation and the history of their use. 
FLEETING FANCIES 
Wandering tabaxi are mercurial creatures, trading one 
obsession or passion for the next as the whim strikes. A 
tabaxi's desire burns bright, but once met it disappears 
to be replaced with a new obsession. Objects remain in-
triguing only as long as they still hold secrets. 
A tabaxi rogue could happily spend months plotting to 
steal a strange gem from a noble, only to trade it for pas-
sage on a ship or a week's lodging after stealing it. The 
tabaxi might take extensive notes or memorize every 
facet of the gem before passing it on, but the gem holds 
no more allure once its secrets and nature have been 
laid bare. 
TINKERS AND MINSTRELS 
Curiosity drives most of the tabaxi found outside their 
homeland, but not all of them become adventurers. Ta-
baxi who seek a safer path to satisfy their obsessions 
become wandering tinkers and minstrels. 
These tabaxi work in small troupes, usually consisting 
of an elder, more experienced tabaxi who guides up to 
four young ones learning their way in the world. They 
travel in small, colorful wagons, moving from settlement 
to settlement. When they arrive, they set up a small 
stage in a public square where they sing, play instru-
ments, tell stories, and offer exotic goods in trade for 
items that spark their interest. Tabaxi reluctantly accept 
gold, but they much prefer interesting objects or pieces 
of lore as payment. 
These wanderers keep to civilized realms, preferring 
to bargain instead of pursuing more dangerous methods 
of sating their curiosity. However, they aren't above a 
little discreet theft to get their claws on a particularly in-
teresting item when an owner refuses to sell or trade it. 
TABAXI NAMES 
Each tabaxi has a single name, determined by clan and 
based on a complex formula that involves astrology, 
CHAPTER 2 I CHARACTER RACl:!S 
prophecy, clan history, and other esoteric factors. Ta-
baxi names can apply to both males and females, and 
most use nicknames derived from or inspired by their 
full names. 
Clan names are usually based on a geographical fea-
ture located in or near the clan's territory. 
The following list of sample tabaxi names includes 
nicknames in parenthesis.

Five Timber (Timber),Jade Shoe Qade), Left-Handed
