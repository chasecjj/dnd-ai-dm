A tanarukk is spawned when an ore tribe turns away 
from its gods and makes sacrifices to the demon lord 
Baphomet. The lords of the Abyss are always eager to 
claim more followers, and the violent ores are prime 
candidates for corruption. A tribe pushed to the edge of 
destruction, its faith in its deities shattered, might be-
seech Baphomet to bless its next generation of warriors. 
In so doing, Baphomet imbues the tribe's unborn with 
demonic might, yielding a generation of tanarukks. 
The ore deities consider such a betrayal of their wor-
ship as a crime punishable by obliteration, and ores 
faithful to their gods view tanarukks as horrid blasphe-
mies that must be attacked on sight. 
On rare occasions, a non-ore that has gained control 
over a tribe performs a ritual to Baphomet in hopes 
of spawning tanarukks to serve as a squad of shock 
troops. Only the strongest warlords and spellcasters 
can keep such a force in line, meaning that often the 
would-be conqueror is slain by its own creations. 
0RC LAIRS 
An ore tribe needs a home base of sorts-a place where 
warriors can reconnoiter after a raid, and ideally also a 
site that can be easily defended to ensure the safety of 
the tribe's noncombatants. Ores establish their encamp-
ments mainly in mountainous areas, around and within 
deep caves or large crevasses in the rock. Although 
Ibey prefer such terrain for strategic purposes, they can 
adapt and thrive in almost any environment. 
Every encampment is divided along lines of worship. 
Those who revere Gruumsh, Ilneval, Bahgtru, and Lu-
thic are given the best parts of the lair, while the follow-
ers of Yurtrus and Shargaas are relegated to the deep, 
dark recesses of the site, away from the rest of the tribe. 
At the center of the camp is the tribe's war hearth. 
Once a war hearth is lit, the priests of Gruumsh keep 
it continually burning, for it represents the rage within 
Gruumsh's unblinking eye. The ores converge on the 
hearth to celebrate victory and to feast after a kill. If a 
tribe moves its camp, coals from the hearth are kept 
glowing within shells and pots so they can be used to 
start the war hearth at the new encampment. 
Given a choice between occupying a site on the sur-
face and one that is wholly or partly underground, an 
ore chieftain typically opts for the latter. If the surface lo-
cation happens to be a ruin left behind by another race, 
ores are more likely to use it as a temporary campsite. 
The ruins of elven settlements are the exception to this 
rule. If ores come across such a place, they desecrate it 
and leave it unfit for any sort of habitation. 
A tribe uses its home base for as long as the resources 
in the surrounding area hold out-enough food for the 
foragers and hunters, and enough victims for the war-
riors. The ores might have to range farther and farther 
from their lair as prey becomes more scarce, and after 
a few months or a year or two, the tribe will be forced to 
move on and find more fertile hunting grounds. 
On occasion, a tribe finds itself in a best-of-both-
worlds situation, able to take over occupancy of an un-
derground space voluminous enough to accommodate 
all the factions in the tribe and within raiding distance 
of a steady supply of prey.
