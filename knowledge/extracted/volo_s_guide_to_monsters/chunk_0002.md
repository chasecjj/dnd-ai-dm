PREFACE 
Well met, adventurer. You seem like a curious sort 
who enjoys the finer things. Permit me to thrust upon 
you my latest masterwork, years in the making. I 
think you'll find it well worth your time and money. 
First, a warning: here there be monsters! 
No less a peerless font of sagacity as Elminster of 
Shadowdale' has attested that more worlds than this 
one teem with monsters. As a result, that "Here there 
be monsters" line has appeared. on maps of worlds far 
from this one, and hidden from your modest scribe. 
And who am I, you ask?
Volothamp Geddarm at yourservice,setting forth 
truths like the deep and ancient secrets whispered 
into my ears by the guardian spirits of the hidden 
tombs of fallen archmages now dust. Yes, in this very 
tome, I set forth divera details, never before gathered
with such coherence
in one place, of the creatures 
varied and strangethat it pleases
s humans and most 
other civilized races to deem "monsters."
I cannot recommend the essential lore contained 
in this volume highlyenough,
and cry it to be 
"life-savinglynecessary" to everyadventurer and 
wayfarer in the wilderlands andthe Underdark, be 
they prospector, miner,or merely
seeking shelter in a 
cavern from prowling beasts or the clawsof winter, 
over the world entire, And should you find it within 
yourself to complain that this or that entry islacking
in veracity or comprehen1ive completeness 6 let it 
be known that I, Volo, took no shortcuts, and stinted 
not in the depth of my probings or the courting
of discomforts in gathering
the most extensive and 
authoritative lore possible. At great personal risk,
mightI add!• 
Betimes I used my not-inconsiderable• magic to 
disguise myself as a tree, stone, or even a puddle, 
and 10 prepare the very best guide I possibly could. 
In the doing, I have seen the most wondrous vistas,
from frosty high mountain peaks where giant castles 
drift past, to the deepest icy lakes beneath the earth, 
where nameless tentacled things stir and slither, and 
, wasawed anew at the beautyof the world that we all, 
monstrous or otherwise, share.
If you find this tome of use, please tell your 
friends,
business
partners, and acquaintances met 
in passing in the street. Then perhaps I'll have the 
chance to pen an even more useful guide, in future," 
And whatever befalls you or me in our unfolding
lives, I remain your humble scribe and obedient 
servant, and am now (and if the gods grant, forever
in lasting
feme), 
Volothamp Oeddarm 12
