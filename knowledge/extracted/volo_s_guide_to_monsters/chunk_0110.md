free the chitines from slavery. Although choldriths and 
chitines lack sexual characteristics, and choldriths need 
no mate to lay eggs, these creatures choose the gender 
identity of their goddess. Choldriths also believe and 
teach that Lolth's spider form, much like that of a chol-
drith, is her truest shape. Any idol to Lolth in a chitine 
colony depicts Lolth in this way. 
As servants of Lolth, choldriths and chitines love 
spiders and spiderlike creatures. They rear spiders and 
similar arachnids, such as cave fishers. Chitine colonies 
erect shrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attracting 
spiders and other evil, brutish beings that serve her. 
Anywhere chitines set up a colony quickly becomes a 
web-shrouded, gloomy, and treacherous place. 
Communal Spiders. Chitines and choldriths resem-
ble spiders, but they behave more like social insects 
such as ants. Chitines are divided into worker and war-
rior castes, and choldriths occupy the top levels of a col-
ony's hierarchy. Each chitine has a social position that 
comes with duties related to that rank, and all chitines 
are expected to willingly sacrifice themselves to protect 
the choldriths. Every chitine has spinnerets and slowly 
produces webbing that is used to build floors, walls, 
structures, objects, and traps that benefit and protect 
the colony. A warrior might be responsible for crafting 
web armor (which is as tough as hide or leather), while 
a group of workers might be tasked to dig a pit trap and 
cover it with fragile webbing disguised with loose dirt to 
appear as a solid surface. 
A colony can support numerous choldriths, which 
serve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. The 
choldriths continually jockey for position, although they 
rarely confront one another in a way that puts the col-
ony at risk. The colony is ruled by a singular sovereign 
that determines which colony members perform which 
tasks, including whether she or any other choldrith is 
permitted to lay eggs. If this supreme ruler receives a 
vision from Lolth, she might change her colony's entire 
course of action. At such times, chitines have emerged 
from the Underdark to settle in remote, gloomy places 
on the surface, from where they can wage war on other 
species, especially drow and elves.
