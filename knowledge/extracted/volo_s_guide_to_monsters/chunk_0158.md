true roles in tribal life. These outsiders live in the most 
remote, deepest parts of the tribe's domain. 
The elite among Shargaas's followers are the assas-
sins and thieves that follow the cult of the Red Fang. 
They perform assassinations, stealthy raids, and other 
covert operations on the tribe's behalf. They rely on 
a mix of intense training and magic granted to them 
by Shargaas. 
Most Red Fang enclaves keep and nurture giant bats, 
creatures that are sacred to Shargaas. Red Fangs ride 
these bats into battle or on secret raids and assassina-
tion missions into enemy territory. 
TANARUKK 
When demonic corruption taints a tribe's leadership, 
ores might turn to abyssal magic to make tanarukks. 
Evil humans who control ores also use such power to 
bolster their followers' strength. 
The demon lord Baphomet gladly shares the secret 
of creating tanarukks with those who entreat him for 
power. The process corrupts an unborn ore of the tribe, 
transforming it at birth into a creature much more sav-
age than an ore. 
Although tanarukks are fearsome fighters, they are a 
threat to their allies off the battlefield. Within the tribe's 
lair, a tanarukk is destructive and volatile, and best kept 
imprisoned. Sooner or later, a free tanarukk rampages 
through the tribe, attempting to take over by force. 
Most such coups fail, but at great cost to the tribe. If a 
tanarukk does seize the leadership of a tribe, reckless 
war is the course it inevitably chooses. 
If a tanarukk manages to breed, its blood taints nu-
merous subsequent generations, so its female descen-
dants randomly produce tanarukks. Rather than risk 
raising a natural-born tanarukk, most tribes slay such 
abominations.

QUICKLING 
Quicklings rocket through haunting, twisted forests 
where the unseelie fey hold sway, both in the Feywild 
and in the world. Racing faster than the eye can track, 
each appears as little more than a blurry wavering 
in the air. 
A quick.ling is a small, slender fey, similar to a min-
iature elf with sharp, feral features. Its cold, cruel eyes 
gleam like jewels. 
Live Fast, Die Youn;. Quicklings owe their exis-
tence-and their plight- to the Queen of Air and Dark-
ness, the dread ruler of the Gloaming Court. Once a 
race of lazy and egotistical fey, the creatures that would 
become the quicklings were late in answering the 
queen's summons one time too many. To hasten their 
pace and teach them to mind her will, the queen shrank 
their stature and sped up their intern'al clocks. The 
queen's curse gave quicklings their amazing speed but 
also accelerated their passage through life-no quick-
ling lives longer than fifteen years. 
Too Fast for Words. The mortal realm is a ponderous 
place to a quickling's eye: a hurricane creeps gradually 
across the sky, a torrent of rain drifts earthward like 
lazy snowflakes, lightning crawls in a meandering path 
from cloud to cloud. The slow and boring world seems 
to be populated by torpid creatures whose deep, mooing 
speech lacks meaning. 
To other creatures, a quick.ling seems blindingly fast, 
vanishing into an indistinct blur as it moves. Its cruel 
laughter is a burst of rapid staccato sounds, its speech a 
shrill squeal. Only when a quick.ling deliberately slows 
down, which it prefers not to do, can other beings prop-
erly see, hear, and comprehend it. Never truly at rest, 
a "stationary" quickling constantly paces and shifts in 
place, as though it can't wait to be off again. 
Mischief, Not Murder. Quicklings have a capricious 
nature that goes well with their energy level: they think 
as fast as they run, and they are always up to something. 
A quick.ling spends most of its time perpetrating acts of 
mischief on slower creatures. One rarely passes up an 
opportunity to tie a person's bootlaces together, move 
the stool a creature is about to sit on, or unbuckle a sad-
dle while no one's looking. 
Tricks of that sort are hardly the limit of their artful 
malice, however. They don't commit outright murder, 
but quicklings can ruin lives in plenty of other ways: 
stealing an important letter, swiping coins collected for 
the poor, planting a stolen item in someone's bag. Quick-
lings enjoy causing suffering that transcends mere mis-
chief, especially when the blame for their actions falls 
on other creatures and creates discord.
