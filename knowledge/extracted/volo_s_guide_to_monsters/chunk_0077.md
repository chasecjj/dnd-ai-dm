YUAN-TI: SNAKE PEOPLE 
The serpent creatures known as yuan-ti are all that 
remains of an ancient, decadent human empire. Ages 
ago their dark gods taught them profane, cannibalistic 
rituals to mix their flesh with that of snakes, producing a 
caste-based society of hybrids in which the most snake-
like are the leaders and the most humanlike are spies 
and agents in foreign lands. 
HUMANS TRANSFORMED 
The people who became yuan-ti were one of the original 
human civilizations. Their society built great temples of 
stone and forged metal into armor, tools, and weapons. 
In their ceremonies they paid homage to the snake as 
the embodiment of the qualities they most appreciated. 
They developed a philosophy of separating emotion 
from intellectual pursuits, allowing them to focus their 
energy on personal advancement and expanding their 
territory. They believed themselves to be the most en-
lightened mortals in the world, and in their hubris they 
sought to become ever greater. 
The serpent gods of the primordial world heeded the 
prayers of these people and hissed dark demands into 
their ears. The people tainted their souls by performing 
human sacrifices in the name of the gods, debased their 
flesh by cannibalizing their victims, and then performed 
a sorcerous ritual while writhing in pools filled with liv-
ing snakes that enabled them to mix their flesh with that 
of serpents, becoming like the gods in body, thought, 
and emotion. Freed from the limitations of their human 
bodies, the yuan-ti used their new abilities to conquer 
new lands and expand their borders. 
ONE RACE, MANY FORMS 
The bodies of all yuan-ti have a mix of humanlike and 
snakelike parts, but the proportion varies from individ-
ual to individual. After the initial metamorphosis of the 
humans, their society quickly coalesced into a caste sys-
tem based on how complete a person's transformation 
was. The vast majority of yuan-ti fall into three catego-
ries- abominations, malisons, and purebloods-while 
the mutated broodguards and exceedingly rare anathe-
mas have their place in the hierarchy as well. 
All yuan-ti can interbreed. Females usually lay 
clutches of eggs, which are stored in a common hatch-
ery, although live births aren't uncommon. A mating be-
tween yuan-ti of different types almost always produces 
eggs that hatch into yuan-ti of the weaker parent, so 
most choose partners of the same type in the interest of 
maintaining the strength of their personal bloodline.

ELMINSTIUl 
• '-' 
The yuan-ti have abandoned their humanity and con-
sider non-serpentine humanoids to be lesser creatures, 
barely more civilized than common apes. Although 
some purebloods are able to reproduce with humans, 
most are disgusted by the idea and would do so only if 
seduction is necessary for a pureblood to preserve a 
role as a confidant or advisor in human society. The very 
rare offspring of such a union are always purebloods, 
although they may appear fully human at birth and for 
several years afterward. 
The yuan-ti know rituals that can transform an in-
dividual into a more powerful type. The cost and time 
required to perform the ritual is prohibitive, and as a 
result most yuan-ti never get the opportunity to undergo 
such a transformation. Every use of the ritual must be 
modified to suit the individual undergoing transforma-
tion, and requires rare herbs, exotic magical substances, 
snakes, and one or more humans to be sacrificed and 
eaten as part of the procedure. 
UNDERCOVER EMPIRE 
The human civilization that gave rise to the yuan-ti was 
among the richest in the mortal world. It rapidly pro-
gressed in metalworking, using keen intellect and magic 
to discover the secrets of making steel. Its military 
shattered rival tribes and developed advanced tactics for 
fighting in forests and open plains. 
The civilization grew into a cluster of allied city-states. 
Conquered neighbors were allowed to keep their leaders 
and culture so long as they paid tribute, swore alle-
giance to the victors, and incorporated their conquerors' 
serpent gods into their religions. These victories sent 
a constant influx of food, ore, and slaves back to the 
home cities. 
The wealth of the empire allowed the ruling elite 
plenty of time to focus on intellectual pursuits. These 
nobles turned to philosophy and prayer, offering gifts of 
magic and animal sacrifices to their serpent gods, pay-
ing homage to the perfection of the ophidian form. The 
serpent gods taught the humans how to take on aspects 
of the snake, but the cost of the change was high, requir-
ing many sacrifices for each person to be transformed. 
Entire households of slaves in one city-state were killed 
and eaten to create the first yuan-ti, and once the news 
of how to perform these rituals spread to other leaders, 
the call for slaves to fuel the process increased. As the 
serpent gods began to demand more and more sacri-
fices, the yuan-ti stepped up their raids on bordering 
settlements to meet this need. 
The physical and magical prowess of the yuan-ti 
empire allowed the former humans to retain their hold-
ings for several hundred years, until a combination of 
drought, attacks by enemies (including dragons and 
nagas), civil war, torpor among the serpent gods, and 
the development of iron weapons by the some of their 
conquered enemies finally loosened the yuan-ti's hold 
over nearby lands. The serpent people withdrew to their 
fortified cities and underground temples, ceding the rest 
of their territory to their former minions. The yuan-ti 
crawled away and hid in a matter of weeks, all but disap-
pearing from the world. Yuan-ti structures throughout 
the land were torn down to celebrate liberation from the
