plishments or claim to be mighty. Such creatures are 
seen as threats or fools, and are dealt with mercilessly. 
Each beholder thinks it is the epitome of its race, and 
therefore all other beholders are inferior to it-even 
though, at the same time, it considers other beholders to 
be its greatest rivals. A beholder might be willing to co-
operate with adventurers who have news about another 
beholder's lair or activities, and might be nonhostile 
toward adventurers who praise it for being a perfect ex-
ample of a beholder. 
The tables that follow present possibilities for per-
sonal characteristics that you can use to make a be-
holder distinctive.

BATTLE TACTICS 
A beholder analyzes its opponents, makes note of armor, 
weapons, and tactics, and adjusts its strategy to elimi-
nate the most dangerous threats as quickly as possible. 
Although a beholder's specific actions will vary with 
each encounter, the creature's behavior is largely gov-
erned by the tactics discussed below. 
STAY OUT OF RANGE AND SIGHT 
A beholder's natural ability to fly is essential to many of 
its defenses and habits. Portions of its lair- especially 
the remote part where it sleeps- usually aren't reach-
able on foot, which makes it harder for its minions to 
take over the lair, and forces intruders to find ways to 
overcome steep vertical climbs. 
Also, a beholder's natural levitation means it doesn't 
risk activating any floor-based traps, and therefore it is 
likely to use such defenses to protect its inner sanctum, 
allowing it to roam freely through the area while hos-
tiles must dodge or overcome multiple obstacles. 
Unless its opponents are concealed by fog, invisibility. 
or some other magic, a beholder can lurk in the dark
