wall. A typical simple door trap is a pivoting spiked arm 
that swings downward to impale an intruder when the 
door is opened. 
Ceiling Trap, In addition to making use of classic 
"gravity traps" such as the collapsing roof, the falling 
net, and the rolling sphere, a beholder can use its disin-
tegration ray to blast a hole in the ceiling above its ene-
mies, opening up a previously prepared chamber filled 
with mud, water, sand, garbage, green slime, petrified 
enemies, poison gas, swarms of centipedes, zombies, or 
any other sort of hazardous material or creatures. 
Gas Spores. One form of gas spore trap is nothing 
more than a small room or section of tunnel that con-
tains one or more hovering gas spores. The passage 
leading to it is sealed off or constricted to prevent the 
fungus creatures from drifting into inhabited areas. 
Medium or smaller intruders can easily move through 
the passage but might have little warning about what 
lies ahead, especially if the passage has sharp turns that 
make it likely that the gas spore isn't seen until the last 
moment. A beholder might use its telekinesis ray to forc-
ibly push a gas spore into an opponent, making the gas 
spore explode. 
Obstacle Course. If its lair includes a long, narrow 
chamber with an uneven floor and multiple terraces, a 
beholder might turn this area into a killing ground. The 
floors count as difficult terrain, and the terraces mean 
that in some places climbing or jumping down is re-
quired to make progress. These areas are often seeded 
with perils both stationary and mobile. The beholder 
and its minions can bypass the area by means of secret 
doors at either end. Some obstacle courses feature low 
walls to slow enemies even further or a portcullis to trap 
them in one section of the chamber. 
Oil Sprayer. The main element of an oil sprayer trap 
is a large tank, filled with oil, embedded into the top of 
a column or located in a space above the trapped room. 
When the trap is triggered, a valve in the bottom of the 
tank opens, and oil spews into the room, making the 
floor slick and igniting if any open flames are present. 
TROPHY GALLERY 
A beholder that has amassed many trophies might set 
aside an area in its lair dedicated to their display. A 
trophy gallery is often a long chamber decorated with 
mementos taken from creatures the beholder has slain. 
Niches and pedestals hold smaller objects, while larger 
objects are suspended from the ceiling or left freestand-
ing in the room. To prevent minions from handling or 
trying to steal trophies, the more favored and valuable 
items are kept on high shelves, accessible to the flying 
beholder but out of reach of anyone on the ground. 
LEAVING THE LAIR 
A beholder goes to a lot of trouble to make its lair as 
safe and comfortable as it possibly can, and so it rarely 
ventures outside. A typical beholder would primarily 
be concerned with securing the area in a 1-mile radius 
around its lair (corresponding to the area of the behold-
er's regional effects), but could range even farther if the 
need arises. It might leave home to confront or forestall 
the advance of creatures that it sees as threats, or to 
capture a new pack of minions, or to go after a particu-
larly enticing trophy. 
When a beholder goes on the offensive against a 
threat outside its lair, it plans ahead and makes use of 
all of its advantages. For example, if it decides a newly 
settled human village nearby is a threat, it and its min-
ions will set up camp nearby and scout the area (usually 
by flying high overhead at night using darkvision) for 
one or two days. Once the layout and guard movements 
are known, the beholder sends its minions to attack or 
draw out defenders while it flies high overhead and uses 
its eye rays to subdue the village, targeting leaders and 
other formidable foes before significant resistance can 
be mounted. 
One of these raids usually lasts less than an hour, af-
ter which the beholder withdraws its forces, leaving the 
terrified survivors to wonder when the next attack will 
occur. Unless they flee, the beholder and its forces re-
turn night after night, each time eliminating key defend-
ers, and ultimately breaking the morale of the survivors, 
at which point the beholder's minions can capture any-
one or anything worth keeping and raze the settlement. 
TREASURE 
A beholder carefully scrutinizes all the treasure in its 
lair and divides the booty into five groups: tools, gifts, 
hazards, trophies, and clutter. 
A tool is any treasure that the beholder can use as 
personal gear. A beholder's body can't use many kinds of 
humanoid-type magic items because it doesn't have the 
body parts to wear them; for example, it can't use gloves 
or boots because it doesn't have hands or feet. But a 
beholder could wear magic rings on its eyestalks or affix 
a magic cloak to its back, and the items function as they 
would if used by a humanoid. 
At your discretion, a beholder might be able to use 
magic items that must be held to activate, such as 
wands; the beholder is assumed to be using its telekine-
sis eye ray to move and point the item in the same way 
that a humanoid would use its hand. A beholder can't 
attune to items that require attunement by a spellcaster 
or a member of a certain class. 
A gift is a treasure the beholder can't use itself but 
that would be useful to a minion, such as magic gloves, 
boots, armor, or an item it can't attune itself to. Usually 
a beholder gives gifts to make a minion more powerful 
and better at its job, which typically involves guarding 
the beholder's lair. Sometimes it uses gifts as rewards 
and incentives for exceptional minions; although it 
prefers to rule by coercion and fear, it understands that 
better results can sometimes be achieved by rewarding 
positive behavior instead of punishing negative behavior. 
A hazard can be put to use in an offensive, defensive, 
or utilitarian capacity. Beholders are skilled at repur-
posing cursed or dangerous items as elements of traps 
or obstacles in its lair, especially if such an item emits 
an ongoing effect that it can suppress as needed with its 
antimagic cone. 
A trophy is a treasure that a beholder cherishes as 
evidense of its power, or serves as a remembrance of 
victory over its enemies, or evokes another sort of posi-
tive reaction from it. The preserved corpse of a rival be-
