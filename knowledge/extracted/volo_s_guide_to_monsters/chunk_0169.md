XVARTS 
Xvarts are cruel, cowardly humanoids spawned by a 
cowardly, renegade demigod. They have blue skin, vivid 
orange eyes, and receding hairlines, mirroring their cre-
ator's appearance. They stand about 3 feet tall. 
Xvarts live in remote hills, forests, and caves. Each 
tribe is led by a speaker, who is usually the brightest 
one among them. The speaker serves as the tribe's am-
bassador, and often dons short wooden stilts and heavy 
robes to look taller and more imperious. The rest ofthe 
tribe hunts for food, plundering crops and livestock from 
nearby farms if the hunt goes poorly. Xvarts aren't much 
of a threat to civilized locations because they are some-
what fearful of humans, dwarves, and elves. 
Raxivort's Betrayal. All xvarts are the degenerate 
offspring of an entity named Raxivort, who once served 
Graz'zt the Dark Prince as treasurer. Raxivort spent 
long centuries watching over the treasury, and in time 
he grew to lust after his master's riches. In one bold 
move, he plundered a treasure vault and fled to the Ma-
terial Plane. One of the treasures he stole was the Infin-
ity Spindle, a crystalline shard from the early days of the 
multiverse that could transform even a creature as low 
as Raxivort into a demigod. 
After he ascended to godhood, Raxivort forged a 
realm called the Black Sewers, within Pandesmos, the 
topmost layer of Pandemonium. He enjoyed his divine 
ascension only briefly, though, before Graz'zt unleashed 
his vengeance. The demon prince had no need to regain 
the Infinity Spindle, since he already possessed power 
greater than what it could grant. Instead, he dispatched 
agents far and wide to spread news of what the spindle 
could do and the puny, pathetic creature that claimed 
its ownership. Soon enough, Raxivort was pursued by 
a variety of enemies, all eager to claim the Spindle as 
their own. 
In the face of his imminent destruction, Raxivort 
hatched a plan. Fleeing to the Material Plane, he wan-
dered across a variety of worlds and spawned creatures 
that were his exact duplicate. These are the xvarts, 
creatures that not only look identical to Raxivort in 
appearance but also foil any magic used to track him 
down. Spells, rituals, and other effects that could reveal 
Raxivort's location instead point to the nearest xvart. 
Although the initial rush of enemies against him has 
subsided, Raxivort knows that the planar powers are pa-
tient. He remains in hiding, a wretch of a demigod who 
does little more than wander the planes, spawning ever 
more xvarts to ensure his continued safety. 
Greedy Thu;s. Xvarts have all of their creator's flaws 
and few redeeming qualities. They lack the physical 
equipment to reproduce, as well as the inclination to do 
so. They are greedy, conniving, and obsessed with the 
acquisition of valuables-the more ornate or bizarre, 
the better. They know they are flawed, and this minor 
amount of self-awareness only magnifies their other de-
ficiencies. They hate almost any creature they perceive 
as better than they are, which includes almost anyone, 
but they lack the courage or wherewithal to act on their 
hatred most of the time. Their fear has led them to dwell 
either in gloomy places on the far fringes of civilized

lands or in areas neglected or forgotten by mightier 
creatures. In other words, xvarts usually live in places 
where normal vermin might flourish. 
Despite their muddled nature, all xvarts have an un-
shakable devotion to Raxivort. The desire to please Rax-
ivort weighs heavily on all their decisions. When things 
aren't going well for them, xvarts naturally assume that 
Raxivort is angry. To appease their troubled lord, they 
stage kidnappings. They fashion nets to capture their en-
emies, which are dragged back to the lair and sacrificed 
on a makeshift altar. Raxivort can hear their supplica-
tions, but he's too afraid to come out of hiding most of 
the time. Occasionally, he does appear before a tribe of 
worshipers as a 9-foot-tall xvart carrying an empty sack. 
In every such instance, Raxivort takes all of the treasure 
that the tribe has accumulated, stuffs it in his sack, and 
disappears, leaving nothing behind as compensation.
