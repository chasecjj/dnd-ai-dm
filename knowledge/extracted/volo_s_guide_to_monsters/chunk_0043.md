THE WARBORN 
While a host pursues conquest, it is taboo for its mem-
bers to copulate. Such proclivities must be suppressed 
so that all effort is focused on the task at hand. Breach of 
the taboo can bring summary execution, so it is rare for 
offspring to be born among the host even when it success-
fully campaigns for years. 
The taboo doesn't extend to female goblinoids that 
come into the host already pregnant and give birth while 
on campaign. Such offspring are called Warborn, a title 
they keep for life. The Warborn are thought to be blessed 
by Maglubiyet, and as a result these young goblinoids are 
carried into battle like a standard and used to rally troops. 
If the host has slaves, they pull wagons or sledges in 
the center of the army, dragging along the equipment 
of war while surrounded by its users. If slaves have yet 
to be acquired, goblins and beasts of burden perform 
this function. 
CONQ,UEST AND OCCUPATION 
Warfare in the name of Maglubiyet isn't conducted like 
the raiding of ores or the wanton slaughter of gnolls. It is 
instead a practice of claiming territory and subjugating 
people. Those who surrender to the host with little or 
no resistance get fair and honest treatment. If they offer 
proper tribute, they can even look forward to avoiding 
goblin whips and chains. Warriors among the con-
quered people might be accepted as auxiliary units in 
the host, if they prove to be capable and trustworthy. 
Typically, a goblinoid host seeks to retain enough of 
the population in a conquered settlement for the com-
munity to continue to produce goods and services. The 
labor force likely includes more youngsters and elderly 
than before the goblinoids' conquest, with a correspond-
ing drop-off in production. In any case, a group of con-
quered people serves the host best when it continues 
to produce resources that the goblinoids can use. Only 
when a settlement offers stiff resistance or has no last-
ing value to the host do the goblinoids resort to slaugh-
ter and slavery to empty it of enemies. 
A host that gains many victories might end up claim-
ing vast amounts of territory and eventually become a 
true nation. Such an empire might last for generations 
if the military can continue achieving new conquests 
or at least claim victories when the goblinoids defend 
territory they previously took over. If triumphs of some 
sort don't keep coming, the bonds of allegiance among 
the goblinoids eventually fray. Legions of hobgoblins 
begin infighting, and goblins shirk their duties while the 
hobgoblins are distracted. Then, seeing the disarray of 
the host as a sign that Maglubiyet is no longer looking, 
the bugbears turn on their hobgoblin leaders, take a few 
of their heads as fresh trophies, and leave. 
LIFE IN A SLAVE STATE 
When a host conquers a settlement or a community, the 
surviving victims quickly learn to adapt to life under gob-
linoid rule. The hobgoblins bring their own legal code 
down upon the vassals, and it is liable to be harsher 
than that to which the inhabitants were accustomed. Yet 
the host will also respect traditions oflaw and custom 
among those they conquer, as an aid to maintaining or-
MONSTER LORE 
MACLUBIYET
1S ARMY OF IMMORTALS 
The war horns of the host signal that every goblinoid has 
the chance to prove his or her worth to Maglubiyet and 
join his Army of Immortals in Acheron, the plane of eter-
nal battle. There Maglubiyet marshals his host against 
slavering ore hordes in a bid to bring Gruumsh and the 
other ore gods to heel, a mythic contest that has pitted the 
goblinoids and ores of the world against one another since 
time immemorial. 
der by pacifying the population. Some surviving civilian 
leaders are allowed to retain their positions, often gain-
ing more privilege and power than they previously pos-
sessed by serving as agents of the goblinoids, helping to 
identify any who are disloyal to the host. 
In matters of religion, there is little or no flexibility. 
The host eliminates any spiritual leaders or temple 
servants who offer any resistance. Clergy of gods that 
are deemed harmless, such as a deity of the harvest, 
can escape this fate. When the host encounters priests 
of deities of battle or conquest, they offer them a simple 
choice: Turn to the worship of Maglubiyet, or prove the 
superiority of your god in combat. Any such priest who 
remains faithful to some other god rarely lasts long, be-
cause the priest will face a succession of foes- as many 
as it takes for the priest to succumb and for others to see 
that resistance is pointless. Maglubiyet ultimately offers 
only two options: submit or die. 
If the settlement has holy sites dedicated to conquered 
gods, these are converted into shrines to the Mighty 
One. All representations of the defeated gods are 
thrown down, ruined, or marred. Mosaics are broken 
apart. Stained glass is shattered. Flags and pennants 
are soaked in blood. Statues are put in chains. Altars 
become chopping blocks where Maglubiyet's bloody axe 
is used to decapitate all who refuse to bow to him. 
GOBLINOID WAR CAMP 
A goblinoid army doesn't stay on the move forever, but 
when they make camp, it isn't for rest and recreation. A 
goblinoid war camp is a place that is constantly ready 
for war, and the hobgoblins run it accordingly. 
A war camp might be a permanent settlement that a 
hobgoblin legion uses as a garrison. The accompanying 
map depicts one such place, and it can also be used to 
represent a location constructed to serve as a staging 
area by a host that is actively campaigning. 
The basic layout of a war camp is circular. To prepare 
the site, slaves, goblins, and any beasts fit for the pur-
pose dig a ditch around the desired location, interrupted 
in places where wide paths provide access to the center 
of the enclosed area. Inside this ring of excavation are 
sections of a wooden palisade, each part capped with a 
gate and a tower on either end. These outer walls and 
gates aren't regularly manned or patrolled, because the 
occupants aren't concerned about being taken by sur-
prise. If an enemy force does approach, though, these 
barriers do a good job of delaying any incursion until the 
goblinoids can rally their defenses. 
Inside the surrounding bulwark, the goblinoids all 
have their separate quarters, organized according to 
their wonts. Typical of any camp are the wide paths that
