BEHOLDERS 
True beholders are isolationists that despise others of 
their kind, but their dreams can give rise to a variety of 
lesser beholder-like creatures, a few of which are de-
scribed here. 
DEATH Kiss 
A death kiss is a lesser beholder that might come into 
being when a beholder has a vivid nightmare about 
losing blood. Instead of magical eye rays, it has ten 
long tentacles, each ending in a mouth full of teeth. In 
coloration and shape it is similar to the beholder that 
dreamed it into existence, but its hue is more muted. 
Blood Drinker. A death kiss survives solely on in-
gested blood, which it uses to generate electrical energy 
inside its body. Paranoid about dying from starvation, 
it obsessively drains even little creatures such as rats 
in an effort to stave off this fate for as long as possible. 
After it drains its prey, it abandons the corpse to scav-
engers. A death kiss prefers to hunt alone. If it meets 
another death kiss, it might fight, flee, or team up, de-
pending on its health and pride. When underground, it 
uses its tentacles as feelers, prodding and examining 
the environment in all directions. Above ground, it usu-
ally keeps its tentacles retracted when on the hunt, then 
lashes out and extends them to their full length to catch 
opponents off guard. 
False Tyrant. In poor lighting and with its tentacles 
extended, a death kiss can be mistaken for a true be-
holder. It might purposely present itself as a beholder 
to an ignorant creature, but this behavior is rare, since 
it usually is focused on hunting and lacks the self-im-
portance and paranoia of a true beholder. It can speak 
through any of its tentacle-throats, and its voice sounds 
nasal and high-pitched. A true beholder has little to fear

Lightning Blood. A creature within S feet of the death kiss takes 
S (ldlO) lightning damage whenever it hits the death kiss with 
a melee attack that deals piercing or slashing damage. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The death kiss makes three tentacle attacks. Up 
to three of these attacks can be replaced by Blood Drain, one 
replacement per tentacle grappling a creature. 
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one tar-
get. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grap-
pled (escape DC 14) ifit is a Huge or smaller creature. Until 
this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the death kiss 
can't use the same tentacle on another target. The death kiss 
has ten tentacles. 
Blood Drain. One creature grappled by a tentacle of the death 
kiss must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed 
save, the target takes 22 (4dl0) lightning damage, and the 
death kiss regains half as many hit points.
