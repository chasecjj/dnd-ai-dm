APPENDIX A: ASSORTED BEASTS 
This appendix contains statistics for various beasts, ex-
panding on appendix A of the Monster Manual. 
AUROCHS 
Bahgtru, son of Gruumsh and Luthic, is the ore deity 
of unbridled strength. Legend says Bahgtru needed a 
mount as fierce as him for making war, so he sought a 
mighty aurochs, subjugated the creature with his bare 
hands, and hauled it to Nishrek, Gruumsh's realm. Bah-
gtru named the beast Kazaht, or "Bull" in Ore. On Ka-
zaht's bare back, Bahgtru charges into battle, ramming 
into an enemy host and leaping over the aurochs's horns 
to land in the midst of his foes.

SWARM OF ROT GRUBS 
Rot grubs are finger-sized maggots that eat living or 
dead flesh, although they can survive on plant matter. 
They infest corpses and piles of decaying matter and at-
tack living creatures that disturb them. After burrowing 
into the flesh of a living creature, a rot grub instinctively 
chews its way toward the heart in order to kill its host. 
Rot grubs pose a threat both singly and as a swarm. 
See the accompanying stat block for the mechanics of a 
swarm of rot grubs. A single rot grub has no stat block. 
Any creature that comes into contact with it must make 
a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the rot 
grub burrows into the creature's flesh and deals 3 (ld6) 
piercing damage at the start of each of the host crea-
ture's turns. Applying fire to the wound before the end 
of the host creature's next turn deals 1 fire damage to 
the host and kills the infesting rot grub. After this time, 
the rot grub is too far under the host creature's skin 
to be burned. If a creature infested by one or more rot 
grubs ends its turn with O hit points, it dies as the grubs 
burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures 
disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target. Bui:ning a 
body kills any rot grubs infesting it.

Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and 
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large 
enough for a Tiny maggot. The swarm can't regain hit points or 
gain temporary hit points. 
ACTIONS 
Bites. Melee Weapon Attack: +Oto hit, reach Oft., one creature 
in the swarm's space. Hit: The target is infested by ld4 rot 
grubs. At the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 
ld6 piercing damage per rot grub infesting it. Applying fire to 
the bite wound before the end of the target's next turn deals 
1 fire damage to the target and kills these rot grubs. After this 
time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned. 
If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with O hit points, 
it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any 
effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target.
