complete the daunting journey to a ki-rin's lair can prove 
themselves worthy of speaking with its occupant. 
Many who seek a ki-rin's guidance end up pledging 
service to the creature. They study as monks under its 
tutelage and serve as its agents in the world. The fol-
lowers of a ki-rin might travel incognito across the land, 
seeking news of growing evil and working behind the 
scenes, or might be champions of their master's cause, 
out to defeat villainy wherever it is found. 
LAIR OF LUXURY 
On the celestial pl'anes, ki-rins reside in lofty, elegant 
aeries filled with luxurious objects. In the world, a ki-rin 
chooses a similar location, such as atop a tall pinnacle 
or within a cloud solidified by the ki-rin's magic. When 
viewed from the outside, a ki-rin's lair is indistinguish-
able from a natural site, and the entrance is difficult for 
visitors to find and reach. Inside, the lair is a serene and 
comfortable place, its ambiance a mix between palace 
and temple. If the ki-rin has taken creatures into its ser-
vice, its lair doubles as a sacred site wherein the ki-rin 
not only rests, but also teaches of holy mysteries. 
Inside its lair, a ki-rin has the power to i;:onjure objects 
up to three times per day, using each of the following 
versions of the power once. One version permanently 
creates enough objects made of soft, plant-based ma-
terial-including manufactured objects such as cloth, 
pillows, rope, blankets, and clothing- to fill a cube 20 
feet on a side. The second version permanently creates

si~ht of my B.rst ki-rin, and 
I've met ~ods.

enough objects made of wood, or similarly hard plant-
based material, to fill a cube 10 feet on a side. The third 
version creates enough objects made of stone or metal 
to fill a cube 2 feet on a side, but any materials created 
in this way last for only 1 hour. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The ki-rin's celestial nature transforms the region 
around its lair. Any of the following magical effects is 
possible for travelers to encounter in the vicinity: 
• Water flows pure within 3 miles of a ki-rin's lair. Any 
purposeful corruption of the water lasts for no longer 
than 3 minutes. 
• Animals, plants, and good creatures within 3 miles 
of the ki-rin's lair gain vigor as they evolve toward an 
idealized form. Such creatures are rarely aggressive 
toward others that aren't normally prey. Evil creatures 
can't tolerate the holy atmosphere within the same 
distance, and usually choose to live much farther from 
the domain of a ki-rin. 
• Curses, diseases, and poisons affecting good-aligned 
creatures are suppressed when those creatures are 
within 3 miles of the lair. 
• A ki-rin can cast control weather while it is within 3 
miles of its lair. The spell's point of origin is always 
the point outdoors closest to the center of its lair. The 
ki-rin doesn't need to maintain a clear path to the sky 
or to concentrate for the change in weather to persist. 
• Within 3 miles of the lair, winds buoy non-evil crea-
tures that fall due to no act of the ki-rin or its allies. 
Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round 
and take no falling damage. 
When the ki-rin dies, all these effects disappear im-
mediately, although the invigorating effect on flora and 
fauna remains for 3 years.
