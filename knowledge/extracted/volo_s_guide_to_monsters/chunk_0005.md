over something, such as a treasure hoard. A gauth hails 
from the same plane as spectators, or one that overlaps 
it enough that they can take advantage of a flawed at-
tempt to summon a spectator. Although true beholders 
can be found on a spectator's or gauth's home plane, the 
creatures' actual place of origin is unknown (whether 
another plane, a world beyond the stars, or some 
stranger location), and spectators and gauths aren't be-
lieved to originate from dreams as other beholders do. 
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS 
As a byproduct of their unique method of propagation, 
beholders in one part of the world tend to look similar, 
with variations becoming more pronounced the farther 
one travels from that area. Even a slight variation in the 
shape of an eyestalk or the texture of its skin is enough 
for one beholder to consider another a flawed abomina-
tion, which should be destroyed. 
Use the following tables to produce a variety of differ-

ROLEPLAYING A BEHOLDER 
A beholder constantly fears for its safety, is wary of any 
creature that isn't one of its minions, and is aggressive 
in dealing with perceived threats. It might react favor-
ably toward creatures that humble themselves before it
