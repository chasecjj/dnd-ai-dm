NEOTHELID 
A slime-covered worm of immense size, a neothelid is 
the result of the mind flayer reproductive cycle gone 
horribly wrong. On rare occasions, an illithid colony col-
lapses, typically after an external assault, and the elder 
brain is killed. When that happens, the colony's tadpoles 
are suddenly freed from their fate. They no longer serve 
as food, and in turn are no longer fed by their caretak-
ers. Driven by hunger, they turn to devouring one an-
other. Only one tadpole survives out of the thousands in 
the colony's pool, and it emerges as a neothelid. 
Abhorrent to Illithids. Among the strongest taboos in 
illithid society is the idea of allowing a mature tadpole to 
survive without implanting it into a donor brain. Under 
normal circumstances, any tadpole that grows larger 
than a few inches in length is killed by the elder brain 
to be food for it or for less mature tadpoles. Any tadpole 
that survives beyond that state is perceived as a threat 
to the colony, and the mind flayers organize hunting 
parties to exterminate the abomination. Lacking enough 
intelligence to be detected by an elder brain's power to 
sense thoughts, neothelids warrant such precautions. 
Sava;e Behemoth. As a feral thing, a neothelid 
knows nothing beyond the predatory existence it has 
lived so far and struggles to comprehend its new psionic 
abilities. Neothelids prowl subterranean passages in 
search of more brains to sate their constant hunger, 
growing ever more vicious. These creatures can spray 
tissue-dissolving enzymes from their tentacle ducts, 
reducing victims to a puddle of slime and leaving only 
the pulsing brain unharmed. They have no knowledge of 
their link to illithids, so they're just as likely to prey on 
mind flayers as on anything else.

Creature Sense. The neothelid is aware of the presence of crea-
tures within 1 mile ofit that have an Intelligence score of 4 or 
higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, 
as well as each creature's Intelligence score, but can't sense 
anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank 
spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived 
in this manner. 
Innate Spel/casting (Psionics). The neothelid's innate spellcast-
ing ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the 
following spells, requiring no components: 
At will: levitate 
1/day each: confusion,feeblemind, telekinesis 
Magic Resistance. The neothelid has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Tentacles. Me/ee Weapon Attack: + 13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one 
target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) 
psychic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it 
must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be swal-
lowed by the neothelid. A swallowed creature is blinded and 
restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects 
outside the neothelid, and it takes 35 (10d6) acid damage at 
the start of each of the neothelid's turns. 
If the neothelid takes 30 damage or more on a single turn 
from a creature inside it, the neothelid must succeed on a DC 
18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgi-
tate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 
10 feet of the neothelid. If the neothelid dies, a swallowed 
creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the 
corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone. 
Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6). The neothelid exhales acid in a 60-
foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dex-
terity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) acid damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
