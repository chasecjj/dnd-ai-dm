CEREMORPHOSIS 
Mind flayers don't reproduce in the traditional sense. 
Instead, they lay eggs from which hatch tadpole-like 
creatures that are used to make more of their kind 
through a process called ceremorphosis. First, a cap-
tured humanoid is rendered docile by a blast of psionic 
power. A newly hatched tadpole is inserted into the 
victim's cranium, usually through a nostril or ear canal. 
The tadpole grows as it devours the humanoid's brain, 
attaching to the victim's brain stem and becoming its 
new brain. Over the course of a week, the humanoid 
body changes form, and a new mind flayer comes into 
being. The emergent mind flayer often retains a few dim 
memories from its previous form, but these vague rec-
ollections seldom have any bearing on its new life as a 
brain-eating monster. 
THE ELDER BRAIN 
Mind flayers use telepathy to communicate with each 
other and with other creatures. Among their own kind, 
they form a network of minds. Each mind flayer is an 
individual node of the network, taking on specific tasks, 
sharing information, and so on. At the center of this 
network is the elder brain. The elder brain is the most 
powerful member of a mind flayer colony.Just as mind 
flayers treat thralls made from captured humanoids, an 
elder brain expects perfect obedience from the illithids 
that dwell in its colony. 
If a single mind flayer in a colony sees or hears some-
thing, the elder brain and the rest of the illithids in the 
colony learn of it immediately. The colony relies on a col-
lective memory, composed from the knowledge, experi-
R I 
MONS1'E.R LO R 
ences, and skills of all of its members and stored within 
the elder brain. 
In some ways, a mind flayer colony is like a great li-
brary of lore stored within its members' minds, with the 
elder brain as its librarian. Each individual illithid rep-
resents a category or subsection within the library. One 
mind flayer might specialize in biology, while another is 
an expert in defending the colony. Given that an individ-
ual mind flayer has a near-genius intellect, the extent of 
its knowledge is equivalent to the highest levels of schol-
arship attainable by humans. 
There are limits to a colony's reach. An illithid can 
be part of its colony's network of minds only while it 
is within five miles of the elder brain. Beyond that dis-
tance, it is on its own. Mind flayers that venture away 
from the colony do so only under strict orders from 
the elder brain. Although such missions risk attracting 
unwanted attention, they can yield a treasure trove of 
knowledge and insights to be shared throughout the en-
tire colony when a roaming mind flayer returns. 
It is convenient for humanoids to understand a mind 
flayer colony by thinking of it as a single individual-the 
elder brain-directing a number of subservient, remote 
minds, which are the individual mind flayers. Perhaps 
at one time each mind flayer was independent, but now 
the elder brain is the only true power. The illithids know 
that their continued survival and their eventual return to 
power are possible only though perfect coordination and 
absolute obedience to the elder brain. 
An elder brain is arrogant, scheming, and power 
hungry, yet quick to flee or beg for mercy in the face of 
a powerful foe. It has no conception of joy, sympathy, 
or charity, but is well acquainted with fear, anger, and 
curiosity. It is an intellect utterly incapable of empathy or 
concern for creatures other than itself. 
An elder brain has a perfect recollection of its race's 
history. Consequently, it views itself as both a refugee 
and a victim, forced into hiding by barbaric monsters. 
An elder brain also sees itself as a savior of the mind 
flayer race and a living memorial that preserves the 
memories of the mind flayers' prey. By its twisted logic, 
humanoids whose brains are devoured by the colony are 
rendered immortal, their memories preserved forever in 
the elder brain's labyrinthine mind. 
When a mind flayer grows old, becomes infirm, or is 
grievously injured, the elder brain absorbs it-another 
form of immortality, as the mind flayer's mind dwells 
within the hive mind forever after. 
See chapter 3 for more information on elder brains. 
RENEGADE lLLITHIDS 
Sometimes a mind flayer that's away from its colony 
breaks free from the elder brain. Perhaps it ran into a 
situation where its bonds of obedience were broken, or 
perhaps the colony was destroyed while it was away. In 
such a case, the mind flayer becomes free-willed for as 
long as it avoids contact with an elder brain. 
A renegade illithid remains fearful of gith attacks, 
and likely sets about creating a sort of colony of its own, 
the better to remain undetected. It gathers minions, 
establishes a lair, and makes defense of its territory a 
top priority. Unlike colonial mind flayers, rogue illithids
