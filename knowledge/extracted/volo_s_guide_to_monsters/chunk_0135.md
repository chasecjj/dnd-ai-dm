HOBGOBLIN IRON SHADOW 
The Iron Shadows are hobgoblin monks that serve 
as secret police, scouts, and assassins. Among other 
hobgoblins, they spy to ferret out treachery, rebellion, 
and betrayal. 
Trained in Secret. Iron Shadows are recruited from 
across the hobgoblin ranks. Each member keeps her 
eyes open for potential recruits, those whose agility and 
stamina are matched only by an ironclad commitment to 
Maglubiyet's will. 
A candidate for admission undergoes a series of 
tests designed to reveal any potential for treachery. 
Those who fail are slain, while those who pass receive 
secret training in the magical and martial arts. This 
indoctrination is a slow and arduous process; many 
aspirants don't finish it, and years mjght go by during 
which the Iron Shadows welcome no new members 
into their ranks. While a recruit is in training, it serves 
the Iron Shadows by looking for and reporting suspi-
cious behavior. 
Masters of Shadow and Fist. When a recruit's train-
ing is complete, she is ready to wield a deadly combina-
tion of unarmed fighting techniques and shadow magic 
to deceive and defeat her foes. She continues to spy on 
RY 
other hobgoblins, but is now also empowered to conduct 
assassinations and spy missions, both against enemies 
and among goblinoids. These missions are ordained by 
the clerics of Maglubiyet, who keep a careful eye on the 
goblinoid community to ensure that it functions accord-
ing to Maglubiyet's will. 
Masked Devils. Iron Shadows on a secret mission 
wear masks crafted to resemble devils, both to conceal 
their identities and to strike fear into their foes. 
Their masks also signify the supposed origin of their 
fighting techniques. The priests ofMaglubiyet teach 
that the Great One stole the secrets of shadows from 
an archdevil, allowing his followers to conceal their 
identities, walk between shadows, and craft illusions to 
confuse and confound their enemies.
