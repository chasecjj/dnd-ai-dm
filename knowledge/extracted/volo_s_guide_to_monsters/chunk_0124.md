Mouth of Madness. The giant is immune to confusion spells and 
similar magic. 
On each of its turns, the giant uses all its movement to move 
toward the nearest creature or whatever else it might perceive 
as food. Roll a dlO at the start of each of the giant's turns to 
determine its action for that turn: 
1-3. The giant makes three attacks with its fists against one 
random target within its reach. If no other creatures are 
within its reach, the giant flies into a rage and gains advan-
tage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn. 
4-5. The giant makes one attack with its fist against every crea-
ture within its reach. If no other creatures are within its reach, 
the giant makes one fist attack against itself. 
6-7. The giant makes one attack with its bite against one ran-
dom target within its reach. If no other creatures are within 
its reach, its eyes glaze over and it becomes stunned until the 
start of its next turn. 
8-10. The giant makes three attacks against one random target 
within its reach: one attack with its bite and two with its fists. 
If no other creatures are within its reach, the giant flies into 
a rage and gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of 
its next t1.1rn. 
ACTIONS

gains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

STONE GIANT DREAMWALKER 
The surface of the world is an alien realm to stone gi-
ants: fluctuating, temporary, exposed to gusting wind 
and sudden rain. It is as wildly changeable as a dream, 
and that's how they regard it-as a dream. Nothing there 
is permanent, so nothing there is real. What happens on 
the surface doesn't matter. Promises and bargains made 
there needn't be honored. Life and even art hold less 
value there. 
Dream Dwellers. Stone giants sometimes go on 
dream quests in the surface world, seeking inspiration 
for their art, to break a decades-long ennui, or out of 
simple curiosity. Some who go on these quests let them-
selves become lost in the dream. Other stone giants are 
banished to the surface as punishment. Regardless of 
the reason, if they don't take shelter under stone, such 
individuals can become dreamwalkers. 
Dreamwalkers occupy an odd place of respect outside 
of stone giant ordning. They are considered outcasts, 
but their familiarity with the surface world makes them 
valuable guides, and their insights can help other stone 
giants grasp the dangers of living in a dream. 
Mad Wanderers. Dreamwalkers are driven mad 
by isolation, shame, and their unendingly alien sur-
roundings, and this madness leeches out into the world 
around them, affecting other creatures that get too 
close. Believing that they're living in a dream and that 
their actions have no real consequences, dreamwalkers 
act as they please, becoming forces of chaos. As they 
travel the world, they collect objects and creatures that 
seem especially significant in their mad minds. Over 
time, the collected things accrete to their bodies, becom-
ing encased in stone.
