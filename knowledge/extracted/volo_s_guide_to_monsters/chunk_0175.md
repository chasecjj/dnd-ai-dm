Spellcasting (Yuan-ti Form Only). The yuan-ti is a 6th-level 
spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC

slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the follow-
ing warlock spells:

nus to each damage roll), mage hand, message, poison spray,

ACTIONS 
Multiattack (Yuan-ti Form Only). The yuan-ti makes one con-
strict attack and one scimitar attack. 
Constrict. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target 
is grappled (escape DC 14) ifit is a Large or smaller creature. 
Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the yuan-ti 
can't constrict another target. 
Scimitar (Yuan-ti Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (ld6 + 3) slashing damage. 
Invoke Nightmare (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The 
yuan-ti taps into the nightmares of a creature it can see within 
60 feet ofit and creates an illusory, immobile manifestation of 
the creature's deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The 
target must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed 
save, the target takes 11 (2dl0) psychic damage and is fright-
ened of the manifestation, believing it to be real. The yuan-ti 
must concentrate to maintain the illusion (as if concentrating 
on a spell), which lasts for up to l minute and can't be harmed. 
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the illusion on a success, or taking 11 (2dl0) psy-
chic damage on a failure.
