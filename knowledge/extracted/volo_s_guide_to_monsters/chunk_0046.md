ELMINSTER 
Hags are curious about other creatures of power. They 
enjoy receiving news and gossip about other hags and 
influential creatures such as dragons, demons, genies, 
and certain mortals. Offering a hag accurate informa-
tion of this sort as part of a bargain earns a small mea-
sure of her respect, and might make her more receptive 
to the idea of a "fair" deal. 
When a hag bargains with other creatures of the Fey-
wild, rather than mortals, she approaches the situation 
with a more respectful attitude. She realizes that the 
creatures of her native realm are more powerful than 
common humanoids and therefore more dangerous 
when disappointed or angered by a deal gone bad. Fey 
are also long-lived and thus have more time to retaliate 
against the hag, whereas most humanoids die within 
a few short decades. These considerations don't mean 
that hags are automatically pleasant in dealings with 
other fey, just that they aren't as blatant or demanding 
in the bargains they offer; hags know exactly how much 
they can get away with, and they like pushing the limits 
of what others will tolerate. 
BARGAINER BEWARE 
When a hag is generous with her help or requires only a 
simple task as payment, that's no guarantee that the deal 
will turn out as expected for both parties. By offering a 
proposal that seems, or actually is, fair, chances are that 
the hag is pursuing a hidden agenda. She still wants to 
set events into motion that benefit her or bring about the 
downfall of another, but she does so in an indirect way 
that has no obvious connection to her. A bargain as sim-
ple as a villager agreeing to deliver a mysterious letter at 
a crossroads at noon on a certain day could be the key 
to ruining the mortal's life. The hag's reasons might not 
become apparent for years or even decades, or won't be 
meaningful except under specific circumstances, such 
as an auspicious birth or a climactic encounter with a 
dangerous villain. Even when she's offering a deal that 
seems to have no downside, a hag is always secretive 
about her motivations, the reasons for the payments she 
requires, or how these things benefit her. 
A hag that spends a long time in close proximity to 
a human settlement often depletes the community of 
good-hearted folk as they succumb to her evil and selfish 
plans. The mood of the town becomes unwelcoming, 
grim, moody, or outright hostile toward newcomers 
and travelers. Even after a hag has done her worst in 
such a place, she maintains leverage over her victims 
by holding out the prospect that someday she will undo 
the curses that she has lain on them. For that reason, 
the local leaders won't allow any outsiders to act against 
her (which includes sabotaging adventurers who might 
decide to confront her). 
ROLEPLAYING A HAG 
Even when a hag acts indifferently or friendly toward 
adventurers, inside she is still a twisted fey creature, 
and she doesn't give two coppers about what anyone 
else thinks or wants. She might casually comment about 
how easily a visitor would fit in her cauldron or make a 
blunt sexual comment about a guest. When a mortal vis-
its a hag, the experience should be nerve-wracking, un-
comfortable, and risky; at any point the hag might lose 
her temper and decide to pull out someone's fingernails 
with her iron teeth. 
Hags look upon younger creatures from the perspec-
tive of a cantankerous grandparent who no longer cares 
what anyone thinks-set in her ways, free to speak 
her mind, and not afraid to bring down punishment if 
pushed too far. Hags enjoy meddling with other people's 
lives, like busybodies with cruel intentions. Any time 
a hag agrees to help someone, the bargain includes a 
price to be paid, plus a hidden plan by which she sets 
the mortal up to fail, or a way that she g~ins leverage 
(whether over the deal-maker or someone else). 
When a hag is presented with an unusual spell, a rare 
magic item, or a person who has a strange magical gift, 
she will sniff it, shake it, listen to it, taste it, murmur odd 
statements to herself, and mentally place a value on the 
merchandise. Hags aren't subtle about showing their 
intent at such times, and one might snatch away the 
offering so she can examine it more closely, even if this 
makes it obvious she is interested. If she doesn't have 
anything ,else like it, or can think of a use for it, or if hav-
ing it means a rival can't get her hands on it, she'll value 
the offering highly. A visitor who offers a desirable item 
as a bribe or a gift is more likely to get a fair deal from 
the hag, or at least likely to suffer less when the true 
price of the deal is revealed. 
If a hag's life is threatened, she will pretend to be 
weak and helpless if she thinks it will spare her life or 
buy her time to retaliate or escape. She'll use dangerous 
treasures as bribes, not telling about their curses or 
side effects. She will lie and deceive and try to turn her 
enemies against each other, playing up their guilt and 
fear and jealousy to tear them apart from the inside. She 
is older, smarter, and more shrewd than any mortal who 
dares to threaten her. 
Hags prefer to cajole and bargain rather than confront 
someone with actual violence; they reserve their aggres-
sive outbursts for situations where they are overwhelm-
ingly more powerful than their opponents (such as when 
attacking children) or have an unfair advantage (such as 
when their enemy is asleep). Although a hag can always 
resort to attacking with her claws, if it comes to that 
then something has gone very wrong with her plans.
