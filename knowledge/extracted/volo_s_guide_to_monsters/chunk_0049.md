HAG VEHICLES 
that she and her sisters are kindred souls, like the mem-
bers of a dark sorority or sisterhood. 
Even though hags don't like each dther, they share 
knowledge and trade secrets, helping them to keep 
abreast of worldly events and possible dangers. Even 
a hag living in a remote, isolated location is aware of 
goings-on that involve her neighboring hags, whether 
through magical communication, personal visits, or 
mundane messengers such as birds. In most cases, 
these relationships with her sisters, though devoid of 
emotion, are the closest a hag comes to having friends. 
When a hag is attacked or killed, other hags are likely 
to hear about it. If the victim was friendly with other 
hags, those responsible for her death might find them-
selves the target of retaliation. If the victim died while 
owing favors to another hag, that hag sees her killers as 
now responsible for the dead hag's debts. If the victim 
was unpopular or if other hags were indebted to her 
(and thus are happy to see her go), her killers might 
receive relatively cordial treatment from those other 
hags instead. 
HACi METAMORPHOSIS 
It's commonly believed that five kinds of hags exist in the 
world (and beyond it). What's not so widely known is that 
some hags can change from one kind to another during 
their lives. 
A hag that lives long enough or has the necessary re· 
sources can alter her basic nature, leaving behind her old 
physiology and adopting that of a hag appropriate to the 
environment of her current home. She might accomplish 
this transformation through force of will over time, or 
faster with the help of a ritual or assistance from her co-
ven. The reasons for making such a change are as varied 
as the personalities and goals of hags. 
Every hag has a particular status relative to others of 
her kind and to hags of all sorts, based on age, abilities, 
influence, alliances, and experience, and is aware of her 
place (though not necessarily satisfied with it). The few 
grandmothers sit at the top of the hierarchy, a larger 
number of aunties are beneath that, and all other hags 
vie for prominence in a chaotic pecking order that no 
mortal can truly figure out. A hag that is known to asso-
ciate with an auntie has a higher status than a similarly 
powerful hag without such a connection, and a young 
hag born of a grandmother begins her existence already 
benefiting from a greater measure of respect and status. 
HAG COVENS 
To a hag, the thought of sharing her home with other 
creatures- even other hags-is disgusting. She has 
nothing but dislike or disdain for anyone other than 
herself, and she loves being alone (except for the com-
pany of minions and other creatures under her sway). 
That's the ordinary state of affairs. But when a group of 
hags have a common goal or they seek greater power to 
combat a formidable threat, they suppress their basic 
nature and come together to do their work. The result 
is a coven. 
Being part of a coven gives each individual hag more 
magic and spellcasting ability, and to her these benefits 
offset the inconvenience and bickering that goes with 
living and working with other hags. 
If a member of a coven is killed and the surviving 
members intend to keep the group from dissolving, 
they immediately attempt to recruit a replacement. This 
process involves each prospective member committing 
cruel acts with the aim of impressing the remaining 
coven members. Adventurers who slay only one mem-
ber of a coven might deal a blow to it in the short term,
