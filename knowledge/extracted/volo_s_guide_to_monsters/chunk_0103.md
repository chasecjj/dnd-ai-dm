Stunning Gaze. When a creature that can see the gauth's cen-
tral eye starts its turn within 30 feet of the gauth, the gauth can 
force it to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw if the gauth isn't 
incapacitated and can see the creature. A creature that fails the 
save is stunned until the start of its next turn. 
Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes at the start 
of its turn to avoid the saving throw. If the creature does so, it 
can't see the gauth until the start of its next turn, when it can 
avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the gauth in the 
meantime, it must immediately make the save. 
Death Throes. When the gauth dies, the magical energy within 
it explodes, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a 
DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) force damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 9 (2d8) piercing damage. 
Eye Rays. The gauth shoots three of the following magical eye 
rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three tar-
gets it can see within 120 feet ofit: 
1. Devour Magic Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on 
a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have one of its magic items 
lose all magical properties until the start of the gauth's next 
turn. If the object is a charged item, it also loses ld4 charges. 
Determine the affected item randomly, ignoring single-use 
items such as potions and scrolls. 
2. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 14 
Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
3. Pushing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 
14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet directly 
away from the gauth and have its speed halved until the start of 
the gauth's next turn. 
4. Fire Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 
Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4dl0) fire damage. 
5. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a 
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. 
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
6. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 
Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious 
for l minute. The target awakens ifit takes damage or another 
aeature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on 
constructs and undead.

,a 
from a death kiss, since it can easily kill or subdue the 
death kiss long before the death kiss gets into melee 
range. Thus, out of self-preservation, a death kiss usu-
ally submits to the rule of a beholder that it encounters, 
though it might attempt to escape as soon as its master 
is preoccupied. 
Simple Tactics. A death kiss lacks the combat fi. 
nesse and intelligence of a beholder. It might attempt 
an unusual maneuver to control its prey (such as flying 
up while grappling), but in most cases, it attaches one 
or more of its tentacles to a creature and drains blood 
until its prey collapses. If it is in a superior position and 
its opponent poses no threat, it might toy with its food, 
slowly squeezing and draining the life out of a creature. 
GAUTH 
A gauth is a hungry, tyrannical beholder-like creature 
that eats magic and tries to exact tribute from anything 
weaker than itself. Its body is about 4 feet in diameter, 
with six eyestalks, a central eye (sometimes surrounded 
by multiple smaller eyes), and four small grasping ten-
tacles near its mouth. It has color and texture variations 
similar to a true beholder. 
Magical Metabolism. A gauth can survive on meat but 
prefers to sustain itself with power drained from magic 
objects. If starved of magic for several weeks, it is forced 
back to its home plane, so it constantly seeks new items 
to drain. A gauth might employ creatures to serve it by 
bringing it items that provide it with sustenance. 
Accidental Summoning. When the ritual to sum-
mon a spectator goes wrong, a gauth might push itself 
through the flawed connection, arriving immediately 
or several minutes later. It might present itself as a be-
holder to ignorant creatures in an attempt to intimidate 
them, or as a spectator to its summoner in order to drain 
magic items it is expected to guard .
