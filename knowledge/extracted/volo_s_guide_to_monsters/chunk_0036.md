STATUS SYMBOLS 
Goblins love symbols of authority, and thus the tribe's 
boss often has such trappings wherever he or she goes. 
Such a symbol can take a typical form, perhaps a crown 
or a throne, but also can be a more distinctive objects 
like a high-backed wolf saddle or colorful boots. The 
castes in a tribe also adopt symbols to indicate mem-
bership or kinship, but the symbols used are rarely the 
same between different tribes and often make little 
sense to other creatures. Some possible status symbols 
are given in the Status Symbols table. A caste or a boss 
might display more than one of these items. 
BOOYAHGS 
Spellcasters of any sort among the goblins are rare. 
Goblins typically lack the intelligence and patience 
needed to learn and practice wizardry, and they fare 
poorly even when given access to the necessary training 
and knowledge. Sorcerers are less prevalent among 
them than in many other races, and Khurgorbaeyag 
seems to dislike sharing his divine power with his fol-
lowers. And although many goblins would readily offer 
anything to have the abilities of a warlock, the patrons 
WHO'S THE Boss? 
Goblins pattern the rule of their tribes after the whip-crack-
ing rule of their god, Khurgorbaeyag, and thus each group 
has one leader that exerts autocratic control. But as with 
many tyrannies, the passing of a leader often results in a 
chaotic transition to the next. Sometimes a goblin boss 
has the foresight to declare a successor, often a child or 
other family member the boss has been able to trust. But 
such a declaration doesn't always prevent a mad scramble 
for influence and allies, or secret backstabbing and out-
right fights over the title. Most often, the victor in such a 
struggle comes from another family of the lasher caste, 
and any allies of the previous boss count themselves lucky 
if their only punishment is demotion to the pariah caste. 
Sometimes another creature assumes control of a 
goblin tribe, by killing or subjugating the current boss 
and cowing most of the rest of the tribe. If the creature is 
dimwitted, like a troll or ogre, the lower-class goblins give 
it obeisance, but before long the upper-class goblins begin 
to think that whoever can bend the ear of the new leader 
can act as the real boss. If the creature brushes aside such 
manipulation, the tribe falls into line behind the new ty· 
rant-better to abide the new rule than conspire against it 
and be called out as a traitor.

Even when a goblin is born with the ability to become 
a spellcaster, the knowledge and talent necessary to 
carry on the tradition rarely persists for more than a 
couple of generations. Because they have so little expe-
rience with magic, goblins make no distinction between 
its forms. To them all magic is "booyahg," and the word 
is part of the name they give to any of its practitioners. A 
goblin with access to booyahg becomes a member of the-
lashers and can often rise to the role of boss. 
Booyahs Caster. This goblin served under a hob-
goblin wizard, stole a look at its master's spellbook, 
and learned a little wizardry by aping the gestures and 
words it remembered. The goblin can cast a randomly 
determined 1st-level wizard spell once per day. Intelli-
gence is its spellcasting ability. 
Booyahs Wielder. This goblin found a magic item (a 
necklace of fireballs, a circlet of blasting, or the like) and 
learned how to use it. 
Booyahs Whip. Khurgorbaeyag saw fit to gift this 
goblin with powers that enable it to dominate others. 
The goblin has ld3 other goblins that slavishly obey 
its orders. 
Booyahs Slave, This goblin warlock serves a patron 
who can extract payment in flesh ifthe goblin doesn't do 
as promised. Often this patron is a coven of hags serv-
ing as the tribe's boss, a fiend that has made its way into 
the world, or an undying lord such as a lich or a vam-
pire. (For more information on undying lord patrons, 
see the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide.) Use one of 
the warlock stat blocks in appendix B to represent this 
goblin, adding darkvision and the Nimble Escape traits 
common to all goblins.
