GOLIATH 
GOLIATHS CAN PROVE USEFUL ALLIES, BUT NEVER TURN 
to them in weakness. They are as hard and unforgiving as 
the mountain stone, as cold and pitiless as its bitter, cold 
winds. Ijyou approach them in strength, they might con-
sider you worthy of an alliance. 
-Tordek, A Guide to the Peaks 
At the highest mountain peaks- far above the slopes 
where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid 
winds howl- dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can 
claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim 
friendship with one. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of 
rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are 
carved from mountain stone and give them great physi-
cal power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, 
making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. 
Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their 
frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility 
to earn a place in the tribe or die trying. 
DRIVEN COMPETITORS 
Every day brings a new challenge to a goliath. Food, 
water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain 
reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire 
tribe, while an individual's heroic effort can ensure the 
entire group's survival. 
Goliaths thus place a premium on self-sufficiency and 
individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, 
counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments 
to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see 
defeat as a prod to improve their skills. 
This dedication to competition has a dark side. Goli-
aths are ferocious competitors, but above all else they 
are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a goliath slays 
a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more pow-
erful wyrm to battle. Few goliath adventurers reach old 
age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accom-
plishments. 
FAIR PLAY 
For goliaths, competition exists only when it is sup-
ported by a level playing field. Competition measures 
talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine 
survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic 
items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance 
one way or the other. Goliaths happily rely on such 
benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an 
advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too 
much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disas-
ter in the mountains. 
This trait manifests most strongly when goliaths 
interact with other folk. The relationship between peas-
ants and nobles puzzles goliaths. If a king lacks the 
intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most 
talented person in the kingdom should take his place. 
Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and 
mock folk who rely on society's structures or rules to 
maintain power. 
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST 
Among goliaths, any adult who can't contribute to the 
tribe is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of sur-
vival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have 
little pity for adults who can't take care of themselves, 
though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result 
of the goliath concept of fair play. 
A permanently injured goliath is still expected to pull 
his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a goliath 
dies attempting to keep up, or the goliath slips away in 
the night to seek the cold will of fate. 
In some ways, the goliath drive to outdo themselves 
feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and 
death. A goliath would much rather die in battle, at the 
peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay 
of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly goliath, 
and even those goliaths who have left their people grap-
ple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical 
skills decay. 
Because of their risk-taking, goliath tribes suffer 
from a chronic lack of the experience offered by long-
term leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their 
leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom 
grown with age. 
GOLIATH NAMES 
Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned 
by the newborn's mother and father, a nickname as-
signed by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A 
birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are 
five syllables or more and end in a vowel.
