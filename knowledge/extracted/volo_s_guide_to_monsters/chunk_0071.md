Those that disappear are simply said to be '"with Shar-
gaas" and are spoken of no more. 
Alliance of Convenience. When faced with a particu-
larly skilled foe able to withstand direct assaults, a war 
chief might call upon the cultists of Shargaas to assassi-
nate an enemy leader, kidnap an influential hostage, or 
steal a valuable item. 
Gruumsh doesn't always look kindly on acts of subter-
fuge and indirectness, because ores are meant to take 
and do what they want through straightforward assault 
and brutality. Nonetheless, when the chief seeks the aid 
of Shargaas to accomplish such a task, the leader of the 
cult is willing to comply-for a price. In exchange for 
its less than honorable services, the leader will strike a 
deal with the war chief to provide food, tools, slaves, or 
some other commodity that the cult prizes. 
LIFE IN THE TRIBE 
Ores survive through savagery and force of numbers. 
Theirs is a life that has no place for weakness, and every 
warrior must be strong enough to take what is needed 
by force. Ores aren't interested in treaties, trade negoti-
ations or diplomacy. They care only for satisfying their 
insatiable desire for battle, to smash their foes and ap-
pease their gods. 
BOOMING BIRTH RATE 
In order to replenish the casualties of their endless 
warring, ores breed prodigiously (and they aren't choosy 
about what they breed with, which is why such creatures 
as half-ores and ogrillons are found in the world). Fe-
males that are about to give birth are relieved of their 
other roles and taken to the lair's whelping pens, where 
they are tended to by Luthic's followers. 
Ores don't take mates, and no pair-bonding occurs in 
a tribe other than at the moment when coupling takes 
place. At other times, males and females are more or 
less indifferent toward one another. All ores consider 
mating to be a mundane necessity of life, and no special 
significance beyond that is imparted to it. 
At 4 years old an ore is considered a juvenile, and by 
age 12 it is a fully functioning adult. Most ores don't live 
past the age of 25 due to battle or illness, but an ore can 
live to about 40, remaining healthy almost up until the 
end. Luthic's divine blessing can further extend an ore's 
life, though Gruumsh is never happy when she uses this 
power and tends to frown upon the one so "blessed." 
FUTURE WARRIORS 
Young ores must mature quickly in order to survive their 
perilous upbringing. Their early years are fraught with 
tests of strength, fierce competition and nothing in the 
way of maternal or paternal love. From the time a child 
can wield a stick or a crude knife, it asserts itself and de-
fends itself while learning to fight, to survive in the wild, 
and to fear the gods. 
The children that can't endure the rigors of a life of 
combat are culled from the main body of the tribe, taken 
into the depths of the lair, and left for the followers of 
Yurtrus or Shargaas to accept or reject. A fully grown 
ore warrior is well prepared for a lifetime of combat. 
SEARCH, DESTROY, REPEAT 
When a tribe is on the move, ore warriors are com-
manded to scour the surrounding landscape for any 
opportunity to spill blood and bring glory to their gods. 
Often, bands of warriors work on a rotation, with one 
group heading out on a raid just as another group 
returns, laden with severed heads, sacks of loot, and 
armfuls of food. Warriors also serve as scouts, bringing 
back detailed reports about the surrounding area so that 
the chief can plan where to send raiders next. 
The territory that ore war parties cover can extend 
for many miles around the lair, and any encampment 
or settlement of elves, dwarves, or humans in that area 
is at risk. If ores come upon a target that is too large to 
assault directly, they will lurk along supply routes, tak-
ing out their frustration on caravans and travelers. Left 
unchecked, a tribe can subsist on this sort of prey and 
booty for quite some time. 
WAR WAGONS 
Ores pillage and scavenge wherever they go-everything 
is loot, and loot is always something to be proud of. In 
order to haul as much food and booty as possible back 
to the tribe's den, every tribe has a sturdy war wagon. 
Since ores are poor crafters, most of their wagons are 
stolen from human or dwarven strongholds, and then 
decorated with uniquely orcish accessories. 
A war wagon is a source of great pride for a war chief, 
comparable to a human army's banner or flag. Many are 
clad in armor and festooned with garish trinkets and 
grisly trophies that hang from hooks and spikes. A war 
wagon makes a good shield against arrows when ores 
besiege an elven fortress, and a heavily modified wagon 
could serve as a battering ram if a settlement dares to 
close its gates, blocking the way to the treasures and 
tasty food that lie within. 
A heavily laden wagon that requires the strongest ores 
to return it to the lair is a sign of great success. One 
that can be moved by the runts of the tribe is proof of a 
shameful performance. 
The loss of a tribe's war wagon can undermine the 
chieftain's authority and cause the tribe to collapse 
into chaos, with the survivors scattering either to join 
new tribes or to strike out on their own. At the other 
extreme, warriors that return home with a heavily laden 
wagon or after heroically defending it from thieves 
gain great respect and advance higher in the tribe's 
pecking order. 
ALL ARE FIGHTERS 
Most of the ores that stay behind when the warriors 
go on their raids are weaker than their tribe mates or 
otherwise not suited for a life of battle. Worshipers of 
Luthic fall into this category, as do some of those that 
revere Yurtrus or Shargaas. But even these ores are 
trained in combat, and all of them are expected to act 
like warriors if the lair is attacked or threatened. Their 
numbers are augmented by any orogs in the tribe, which 
are primarily responsible for making sure that the lair is 
protected from intruders.
