Telepathic Hub. Wh'rn the mindwitness receives a telepathic 
message, it can telepathically share that message with up to 
seven other creatures within 600 feet of it that it can see. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The mindwitness makes two attacks: one with its 
tentacles and one with its bite. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attock: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
Hit: 16 (4d6 + 2) piercing damage. 
Tentacles. Melee Weopon Attock: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one crea-
ture. Hit: 20 (4d8 + 2) psychic damage. If the target is Large 
or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) and must succeed 
on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this 
grapple ends. 
MINDWITNESS 
If the beholder can be stunned and brought safely to the 
brine pool of the elder brain, it can be converted through 
ceremorphosis into a mindwitness. The process of cer-
emorphosis transforms four of the beholder's eyestalks 
into tentacles similar to those of a mind flayer, and alters 
some of the beholder's eye rays. 
Less intelligent than beholders and less liable to 
endanger the colony, mindwitnesses are psionically im-
printed with devotion to the elder brain and submission 
to illithid commands, making them almost as obedient 
as intellect devourers. 
Telepathic Hub. The primary function of a mindwit-
ness is to improve telepathic communication in a mind 
flayer colony. A creature in telepathic communication 
with a mindwitness can converse telepathically through 
it to as many as seven other creatures the mindwitness 
can see, allowing the rapid spread of commands and 
other information. 
Solitary Seekers. If separated from its illithid mas-
ters, a mindwitness seeks out other telepathic creatures 
to tell it what to do. Mindwitnesses have been known 
to ally with flumphs and telepathic planar beings such 
as demons, shifting their worldview and changing their 
alignment to match that of their new masters. 
Eye Rays. The mindwitness shoots three of the following magi-
cal eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three 
targets it can see within 120 feet ofit: 
1. Aversion Roy. The targeted creature must make a DC 13 
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disad-
vantage on attack rolls for 1 minute. The target can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 
on itself on a success. 
2. Feor Roy. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 
Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, end-
ing the effect on itself on a success. 
3. Psychic Roy. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelli-
gence saving throw or take 27 (6d8) psychic damage. 
4. Slowing Roy. The targeted creature must make a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is 
halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reac-
tions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its 
turn but not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on 
a success. 
5. Stunning Roy. The targeted creature must succeed on a 
DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. 
The target can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must make a 
DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the mindwitness 
moves it up to 30 feet in any direction, and it is restrained by 
the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the mindwitness's 
next turn or until the mindwitness is incapacitated. 
If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that 
isn't being worn or carried, it is telekinetically moved up to 30 
feet in any direction. The mindwitness can also exert fine con-
trol on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool 
or opening a door or a container.
