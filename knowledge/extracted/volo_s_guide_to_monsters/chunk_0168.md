Woon WOAD 
A wood woad is a powerful plant in humanoid form 
invested with the soul of someone who gave up life to 
become an eternal guardian. 
Born of Sacrifice. The ritual to create a wood woad is 
a primeval secret passed down through generations of 
savage societies and dark druid circles. Performing the 
ritual isn't necessarily an act of evil, if the victim-to-be 
has entered into a bargain that requires it to be a willing 
sacrifice. 
In the ritual a living person's chest is pierced and the 
heart removed. A seed is then pushed into the heart, and 
it is placed in a tree. Any hollow or crook will do, but of-
ten a special cavity is carved out of the trunk. The tree is 
then bathed and watered with the blood of the sacrificed 
victim, and the body is buried among the tree's roots. Af-
ter three days, a sprout emerges from the ground at the 
base of the tree and swiftly grows into a humanoid form. 
This new body, armored in tough bark and bearing a 
gnarled club and shield, is at once ready to perform its 
duty. The one who performed the ritual sets the wood 
woad to its task, and the creature follows those orders 
unceasingly. 
Pidless Protectors. A wood woad has a hole where 
its heart would be, just as does the body of its former 
self, buried in the earth. Those who become wood 
woads trade their free will and all sense of sentiment 
for supernatural strength and a deathless duty. They 
exist only to protect woodlands and the people who tend 
them. A wood woad's face is void and expressionless, 
except for the motes of light that swim about in its eye 
sockets. Wood woads speak little, and when not being 
called upon to take adion, they root themselves in the 
earth and silently take sustenance from it. 
Uprooted by Immortality. Like a tree, a wood woad 
needs only sunlight, air, and nutrients from the earth 
to go on living. Because they are undying, some wood 
woads outlive their original purpose. The site a wood 
woad guards might lose its power or significance over 
time, or those whom it was assigned to guard might 
themselves die. If it is freed from its specific duties, a 
wood woad might roam to find another place of natural 
beauty or fey influence to watch over. 
Wood woads are drawn to creatures that ha.ve close 
ties to nature, and that protect and respect the land, 
such as druids and treants. Some treants have wood 
woad servants by virtue of age-old pacts with druids or 
fey that performed the rituals, while others acquire the 
services of freed wood woads that find renewed purpose 
in the domain of a kindred guardian.
