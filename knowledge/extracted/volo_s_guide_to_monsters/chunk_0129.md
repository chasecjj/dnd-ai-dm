GNOLL WITHERLING 
Sometimes gnolls turn against each other, perhaps to 
determine who rules a war band or because of extreme 
starvation. Even under ordinary circumstances, gnolls 
that are deprived of victims for too long can't control 
their hunger and violent urges. Eventually, they fight 
among themselves. 
The survivors devour the flesh of their slain comrades 
but preserve the bones. Then, by invoking rituals to Yee-
noghu, they bring the remains back to a semblance of 
life in the form of a gnoll witherling. 
Witherlings act much as gnolls do in life, traveling 
with their comrades and trying to kill anything in their 
path. They don't eat and aren't motivated by hunger, 
leaving more flesh for the rest of the war band. Gnoll 
witherlings are incapable of wielding any weapon more 
sophisticated than a simple club. 
Undead Nature. A gnoll witherling doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.

GRUNGS 
Grungs are aggressive froglike humanoids found in rain 
forests and tropical jungles. They are fiercely territorial 
and see themselves as superior to most other creatures. 
Tree-Dwelling Amphibians. Grungs live in trees and 
prefer shade. A grung hatchery is maintained in well-
guarded ground-level pools. About three months after 
hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult. 
It takes another six to nine months for a grung juvenile 
to reach maturity. 
Castes and Colors. Grung society is a caste system. 
Each caste lays eggs in a separate hatching pool, and 
juvenile grungs join their caste upon emergence from 
the hatchery. All grungs are a dull greenish gray when 
they are born, but each individual takes on the color of 
its caste as it grows to adulthood. 
Green grungs are the tribe's warriors, hunters, and 
laborers, and blue grungs work as artisans and in other 
domestic roles. Supervising and guiding both groups 
are the purple grungs, which serve as administrators 
and commanders. (Use the grung stat block to repre-
sent members of the green, blue, and purple castes.) 
Red grungs are the tribe's scholars and magic users. 
They are superior to purple, blue, and green grungs and 
given proper respect even by grungs of higher status. 
(Use the grung wildling stat block to represent mem-
bers of the red caste.) 
Higher castes include orange grungs, which are elite 
warriors that have authority over all lesser grungs, and 
gold grungs, which hold the highest leadership posi-
tions. A tribe's sovereign is always a gold grung. (Use 
the grung elite warrior stat block to represent members 
of the orange and gold castes.) 
A grung normally remains in its caste for life. On 
rare occasions, an individual that distinguishes itself 
with great deeds can earn an invitation to join a higher 
caste. Through a combination of herbal tonics and ritual 
magic, an elevated grung changes color and is inducted 
into its new caste in the same way that a juvenile of the 
VARIANT: GRUNC POISON 
Grung poison loses its potency 1 minute after being re-
moved from a grung. A similar breakdown occurs if the 
grung dies. 
A creature poisoned by a grung can suffer an additional 
effect that varies depending on the grung's skin color. This 
effect lasts until the creature is no longer poisoned by 
the grung. 
Green. The poisoned creature can't move except to 
climb or make standing jumps. If the creature is flying, it 
can't take any actions or reactions unless it lands. 
Blue. The poisoned creature must shout loudly or other-
wise make a loud noise at the start and end of its turn. 
Purple. The poisoned creature feels a desperate need to 
soak itself in liquid or mud. It can't take actions or move 
except to do so or to reach a body ofliquid or mud. 
Red. The poisoned creature must use its action to eat if 
food is within reach. 
Orange. The poisoned creature is frightened of its allies. 
Gold. The poisoned creature is charmed and can 
speak Grung.

caste would be. From then on, the grung and its progeny 
are members of the higher caste. 
Naturally Toxic. All grungs secrete a substance that 
is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures. A 
grung also uses venom to poison its weapons. 
Slavers. Grungs are always on the lookout for crea-
tures they can capture and enslave. Grungs use slaves 
for all manner of menial tasks, but mostly they just like 
bossing them around. Slaves are fed mildly poisoned 
food to keep them lethargic and compliant. A creature 
afflicted in this way over a long period of time becomes 
a shell of its former self and can be restored to normalcy 
only by magic. 
Water Dependency. A grung that fails to immerse 
itself in water for at least 1 hour during a day suffers one 
level of exhaustion at the end of that day. A grung can 
recover from this exhaustion only through magic or by 
immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.

Poisonous Skin. Any creature that grapples the grung or oth-
erwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must

contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end 
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start. 
ACTIONS
