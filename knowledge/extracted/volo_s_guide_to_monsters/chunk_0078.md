snake-bodied oppressors, and within a few generations 
the yuan-ti were all but forgotten by the new humanoid 
civilizations. 
For over a thousand years after their empire fell, the 
yuan-ti remained ensconced in their hidden strong-
holds, biding their time until they were ready to strike 
again. Today, with their numbers greatly depleted and 
their enemies much stronger than in ages past, the yu-
an-ti know they can't resort to direct attacks in order to 
reclaim their rightful place in the world. Operating out 
of the subterranean ruins of their buildings in foreign 
lands, yuan-ti agents infiltrate enemy governments to 
discover weaknesses that their leaders can exploit. The 
yuan-ti look forward to the day when their empire rises 
again and spreads across the world like venom through 
the blood, as it once did. 
Because their population is so small, the yuan-ti are 
aware they are vulnerable in open warfare. Instead, 
their current plans assume they will never rule out-
wardly in human society, so they gain influence by 
controlling enemy rulers-and those close to them-
through blackmail, drugs, magic, and the subterfuge of 
disguised purebloods. 
Goos OF THE YUAN-TI 
The detached, intellectual nature of the yuan-ti doesn't 
lend itself to fervent or devout worship in the manner 
that others revere their deities. Nonetheless, they ac-
knowledge a wide range of supernatural and divine enti-
ties. Some of these are true deities, some are primordial 
spirits as powerful as gods, and some are creatures of 
questionable origin. 
In addition to the three primary deities discussed 
below, the yuan-ti worship over a dozen other "serpent 
pis" -lesser beings such as animal spirits, ascended 
heroes, divine servants of more powerful gods, and 
demon lords. Many of the cults devoted to these lesser 
pis are unique to a particular city, and followers of the 
three main yuan-ti deities usually consider these reli-
gi<rus practices quaint rather than threatening. 
DENDAR 
The Night Serpent came into being before recorded 
Jaistory, spawned from the feverish dreams of the first 
intelligent creatures. She subsists and grows stronger 
. · feeding on the fears that plague the folk of the world. 
Her followers believe that Dendar is a harbinger of 
the end of things, which will come when she amasses 
enough power to consume the world. Another legend 
a,ncerning her speaks of an iron door to the underworld 
behind which she lurks; when the time is right, she will 
tear it down, then eat the sun, plunging the world into 
darkness before she finally devours it. 
Yuan-ti worshipers of Dendar are led by nightmare 
speakers, malison warlocks that honor their deity 
through acts of terror and receive magical power in re-
turn. Rather than killing enemies, these followers of the 
!tight Serpent prefer to threaten and torture them, the 
better to feed and strengthen the goddess. See chapter 
of this book for more information on yuan-ti malison 
llightmare speakers.

ELMINSTER 
MERRSHAULK 
Though the Master of the Pit is not conscious, neither 
is he entirely dormant. Mirroring the fate of yuan-ti in 
the world, Merrshaulk entered a deep slumber when the 
serpent folk left the surface and went into hiding in ages 
past. It is unclear if declining worship caused him to fall 
asleep, or if his prolonged torpor caused his worshipers 
to abandon him. Even in his compromised state, Merr-
shaulk grants spells to his clergy in response to their 
invocations. Rousing him for advice or direct interven-
tion is possible, but requires many ritual murders to be 
performed in his name, and his return to consciousness 
lasts only a short time. 
The leaders of Merrshaulk's worshipers, called pit 
masters, are malison warlocks that uphold and advance 
the age-old yuan-ti traditions. They sense that it has be-
come easier to wake him in recent decades, and believe 
this to be a sign that he will soon fully awaken, shed 
his skin, and- renewed by transformation- restore the 
yuan-ti to their rightful place as masters of the mortal 
world. See chapter 3 of this book for more information 
on yuan-ti malison pit masters. 
SSETH 
In the last years before the yuan-ti empire collapsed, 
Sseth appeared to the serpent folk in the form of a 
winged yuan-ti. He promised to lead the yuan-ti away 
from the brink of defeat and back to the pinnacle of 
world domination in return for their veneration. Many 
of Merrshaulk's devout turned to the worship of the 
Sibilant Death, believing him to be an avatar of their 
deity. They granted him enough power to mount a brief 
recovery, but those actions were too little and too late to 
prevent the collapse of the empire. Sseth chose to rest 
and gather strength during the years of decline, as more 
and more of the yuan-ti adopted his worship. 
YUAN·TI RELICS 
Goos OF OTHER WORLDS 
In worlds other than the Forgotten Realms, yuan-ti make 
pacts with deities of the pantheons presented in appendix 
B of the Player's Handbook. The following are suggested 
yuan-ti deities for each pantheon. 
Greyhawk. Erythnul, luz, Tharizdun, Vecna. 
Dragonlance. Chemosh, Sargonnas. 
Eberron. The Fury, the Keeper, the Mockery, the Shadow, 
the Traveler. 
Celtic. Math Mathonwy, Merrigan. 
Greek. Ares, Hecate. 
Egyptian. Apep, Set. 
Norse. Hel, Loki. 
His most devout followers, known as mind whisper-
ers, use their god-given magic to emulate Sseth's tactics 
and principles. They strive to succeed by offering an 
alternative choice to contesting viewpoints or plans, and 
in so doing they exude an air of self-importance that 
gives them a less than savory reputation among yuan-ti 
that follow other gods. See chapter 3 of this book for 
more information on yuan-ti malison mind whisperers. 
SERPENT GODS 
The yuan-ti's dispassionate attitude toward religion is 
especially evident among the powerful yuan-ti that take 
one of the lesser serpent gods as an object of worship. 
The worshiper of a serpent god pays homage not out 
of respect or fear, but because it aspires to emulate the 
entity, beseeching it to reveal the secret of transcending 
mortality. Then, once armed with that knowledge, the 
yuan-ti sets out to supplant its deity and become a new 
serpent god. 
The serpent gods don't wish to be brought low, or to 
be bled of power as Merrshaulk was, so they mollify 
their worshipers with pronouncements that hint at what 
the supplicants seek. The truth is never easy to ferret 
out, but rarely an exceptionally clever yuan-ti succeeds 
in attaining divine form and vanquishing its benefactor. 
This cannibalistic pressure from mortals means that 
the lower ranks of the serpent gods experience a change 
every century or so, although often it is the newest yu-
an-ti godling that falls prey to the next one's ambitions.
