The trick lies in l•ttin, truth out of her.

but later on the surrounding region is wracked with 
plagues, curses, and other disasters as the applicants 
attempt to outdo one another. 
An unusually gifted mortal sorcerer, warlock, or 
wizard of a deeply evil nature might be invited to join 
a coven or allowed to compete for a vacancy. This ar-
rangement is potentially a dangerous proposition for the 
mortal, but a pair of hags might agree to it if their needs 
are served. For instance, a human member of a coven 
makes an ideal spy and infiltrator in and around a hu-
manoid settlement. 
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY 
Hags make more hags by snatching and devouring hu-
man infants, birthing daughters who turn into hags on 
entering the thirteenth year of their lives. Fortunately 
for humanity and the rest of the world, such an occur-
rence is rare. 
Rarer still, but not unheard of, is for a hag to repeat 
this process twice or more in short succession, giving 
her multiple offspring of about the same age. She might 
do this to form a coven with two of her daughters, or 
to create a coven made up entirely of her offspring. 
Some hags cite ancient lore that suggests that if a hag 
consumes twins or triplets, her offspring might have 
additional, unusual abilities; similarly, devouring the 
seventh-born child of a seventh-born is said to be a way 
to pass on rare magic to the hag's daughter. 
ALTERNATIVE COVEN SPELLS 
Some covens gather for a specific purpose, such as to 
defeat a champion of good, to serve as oracles for the 
delivery of baleful prophecies, or to corrupt a pristine 
wilderness. In such a case, because the coven strives to 
bend its magic to a more directed purpose, the members 
have different spells available for use with their Shared 
Spellcasting trait, usually focusing on a theme related to 
THE RULE OF THREE 
They say that things come in threes. Good things. Bad 
things. Strange things. Hags and purveyors of witchcraft 
embrace the Rule ofThree, as it is called: a coven has 
three members, they believe that good or evil magic re-
turns upon its source threefold, and the casting of many 
spells requires the same words chanted three times. 
Long ago, planar travelers came to recognize that many 
of the realms and layers of the multiverse are configured in 
multiples of three. It is possible that plane-traveling hags 
learned of this planar-based superstition and adapted it 
to their own uses, although some among the oldest hags 
claim to have invented the concept or at least named it. 
caA.l'T£R I t MONSTER LORE 
that purpose. Three examples of themed hag coven spell 
lists are given below. 
Death. For a coven whose members are obsessed 
with death and the ability to manipulate it, an appropri-
ate spell list would be: 
1st level (4 slots):false life, inflict wounds 
2nd level (3 slots): gentle repose, ray of enfeeblement 
3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, revivify, speak with dead 
4th level (3 slots): blight, death ward 
5th level (2 slots): contagion, raise dead 
6th level (1 slot): circle of death 
Nature. Hags might seek to exert control over their 
environment and the creatures in it by mastering the 
following group of spells: 
1st level (4 slots): entangle, speak with animals 
2nd level (3 slots): flaming sphere, moonbeam, spike growth 
3rd level (3 slots): call lightning, plant growth 
4th level (3 slots): dominate beast, grasping vine 
5th level (2 slots): insect plague, tree stride 
6th level (1 slot): wall of thorns 
Prophecy. The power to affect the future or perceive 
things out of the norm could make these spells attrac-
tive to a coven: 
1st level (4 slots): bane, bless 
2nd level (3 slots): augury, detect thoughts 
3rd level (3 slots): clairvoyance, dispel magic, nondetection 
4th level (3 slots): arcane eye, locate creature 
5th level (2 slots): geas, legend lore 
6th level (1 slot): true seeing 
HAG LAIRS 
No matter what form it takes, a hag's home is a manifes-
tation of her basic nature. It is ugly, eerie, or unnerving 
in some way, often incorporating some aspect of decay, 
such as a dead tree, a ruined tower, or a menacing cave 
entrance that resembles a skull. 
Whether naturally or by manufactured means, the 
lair is well defended from intrusion. It might be reach-
able only by a steep mountain path, or it might be sur-
rounded by a fence the hag builds out of posts capped 
with magically warded skulls. Often, a lair reflects the 
outlook of its primary inhabitant- a murderous hag's 
home might be crafted to look like a coffin or a mau-
soleum, and that of a gluttonous one might look like a 
tavern or a gingerbread house. Because such places are 
convenient for them, sea hags often establish their lairs 
inside the hulls of wrecked or abandoned ships. 
BEST OF BOTH WORLDS 
Many hags settle in places where the barriers between 
the mortal world and the Feywild are thin, making it 
easy for them to interact and bargain with creatures of 
both realms. Other popular choices are a place where 
the ambient energy augments certain kinds of magic, a 
site related to death such as a burial ground, and within 
a ring of fallen standing stones that still resonate with 
ancient power. In order to facilitate bargaining with mor-
tals, the home must be near enough to a populated area 
that it attracts occasional visitors, but not so close that a 
community would see the hag's presence as a threat and 
try to defeat her or drive her off.
