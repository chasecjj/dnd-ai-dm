GIANTS 
The giants presented here are more powerful than oth-
ers of their kind, either because their gods have shown 
them favor or because fate has dealt them a bad hand 
and forced them to seek out other paths to power. 
CLOUD GIANT SMILING ONE 
Cloud giants aren't, on the whole, religious. They tol-
erate many conflicting ideas about their patron deity, 
Memnor. The smiling ones strain that tolerance. 
Smiling ones are cloud giants who honor and emulate 
Memnor's craftiness and deceit above all else. They are 
tricksters supreme who use sleight of hand, deception, 
misdirection, and magic in their pursuit of wealth. They 
also possess a flair for unpredictability and a wicked 
sense of humor. 
While cloud giants expect a certain amount of trickery 
and deceit in their dealings with others of their kind, 
smiling ones overstep the bounds of decorum with their 
behavior, doing and saying things that nobler cloud gi-
ants consider beneath the dignity of their kind. 
Mysterious Masks. Smiling ones take their name 
from the strange two-faced masks they wear. The smil-
ing half of the face often looks more like a smirk or a tri-
umphant sneer than a pleasant grin. The frowning half 
represents the displeasure smiling ones feel about their 
place in the ordning- second to the storm giants. The 
masks serve as symbols of their devotion, but they also 
conceal their wearers' true facial expressions.

FIRE GIANT DREADNOUGHT 
The ordning for fire giants emphasizes not just strength 
but also skill at forgecraft. The foundry is the heart of 
any fire giant community. It is temple, school, proving 
ground, and political hub rolled into one. 
Those who have brawn but little brain are usually con-
signed to the lowliest of tasks such as working forge bel-
lows or moving coal. However, there is one role at which 
the strongest among them can excel and gain rank: the 
dreadnought.
