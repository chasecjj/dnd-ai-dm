magically warded to prevent anyone from climbing the 
building's exterior. Interior walls usually have floor-level 
holes or tunnels that a Medium or Large snake could 
pass through, allowing the yuan-ti's serpentine pets, as 
well as abominations and malisons in snake form, to 
bypass human-style doors for convenience or in order 
to respond quickly to invaders. In well-traveled areas, 
ramps replace stairs, making it easier to snake-bodied 
yuan-ti to move between levels. 
A yuan-ti settlement usually has a paved plaza, and 
major roads are also paved. Fountains, gardens, and 
carved, freestanding columns are common elements. 
Six-foot-high walls high divide the community into city 
blocks or districts, with open arches allowing traffic to 
pass through. 
Yuan-ti lairs in human settlements are nothing like 
the accommodations in their own cities. Because these 
locations are used mainly by humanoid purebloods and 
cultists (or were built by humanoids and taken over by 
yuan-ti), stairs and humanoid architecture are the norm. 
Each of these sites resembles the headquarters of a spy 
ring, a thieves' guild, or a hedonistic cult rather than the 
outpost of an evil empire bent on cannibalism and world 
domination, but it usually has a sacrificial slab tucked 
away in a corner for special events. 
Particularly in their cities, yuan-ti rely on poison traps 
to keep intruders, spies, and rebellious slaves out of sen-
sitive areas. Traps are commonly placed on door locks, 
chests, and fake objects designed to attract looters. One 
insidious delivery method uses blocks of special incense 
to fill a room with poisonous faint smoke that disguises 
the presence of the poison until it takes effect. 
PYRAMID TEMPLE 
In a typical yuan-ti city, one of the busiest and most 
prominent buildings is the temple complex that houses 
yuan-ti and their followers while it provides facilities 
for worship, sacrifice, and all the other hallmarks of 
daily life. The accompanying map is an example of such 
a location. 
CULTIST LEVEL 
The lowest level of the temple includes sleeping and 
living quarters for favored or high-ranking cultists, as 
well as a shrine and a separate temple where the cultists 
can conduct their own ceremonies. The area has two 
ground-level entrances that are always well concealed 
and usually trapped, plus a guard room nearby that of-
fers additional security. 
PUREBLOOD LEVEL 
Beginning with the second level, the accommodations in 
the rest of the temple are meant for yuan-ti only, and ac-
cess is limited accordingly. Purebloods live and work on 
this tier, which features cages for slaves, special quar-
ters for the current slave master, and a centrally located 
torture chamber. A pair of staircases offer access to the 
next level up. 
ABOMINATION LEVEL 
The yuan-ti at the top of the social hierarchy reside in 
the most insulted level of the pyramid, within quick

striking distance 'or the levels above and below. On this 
level, substantially sized quarters for abominations 
are laid around the perimeter of the temple's largest 
chamber, a hall where the entire population of the place 
can assemble. 
MALISON LEVEL 
Of all yuan-ti, the malisons have the strongest proclivity 
for worship of their deities. As such, they occupy the up-
permost residential level in the pyramid, one step below 
the mount. This level contains a library where the yu-
an-ti store the knowledge of their transformation rituals, 
and a chamber where those rituals are performed. 
TEMPLE MOUNT 
At the apex of the pyramid, reachable by ascending the 
exterior steps from ground level but not through an inte-
rior staircase, is a plateau surrounded by viewing areas. 
The center holds an elaborately decorated altar, where 
many a sacrifice meets its end as yuan-ti witnesses pay 
homage to their gods. 
ALLIES AND MINIONS 
Yuan-ti have been controlling and manipulating lesser 
creatures for hundreds of years. They enslave beasts 
and intelligent creatures to serve them and guard their 
homes, and they blackmail, enchant, or enthrall others 
to be their agents in humanoid lands. 
RANDOM YUAN- TI SERVANTS 
Yuan-ti employ a variety of creatures as spies and pro-
tectors. The Yuan-ti Agents table lists groups of crea-
tures that work for the yuan-ti, representing their mas-
ters' interests. Agents of the serpent folk might roam 
the countryside on a specific mission or operate secretly 
inside a humanoid community. The Yuan-ti Protectors 
table includes creatures that serve as guardians either 
within a yuan-ti city or in a yuan-ti hideout inside a hu-
manoid city,
