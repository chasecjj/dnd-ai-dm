Mental Fortitude. The neogi has advantage on saving throws 
against being charmed or frightened, and magic can't put the 
neogi to sleep. 
Spider Climb. The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, includ-
ing upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The neogi makes two attacks: one with its bite 
and one with its claws. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 6 (ldG + 3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, 
and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving 
throw or become poisoned for l minute. A target can repeat 
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the ef-
fect on itself on a success. 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. 
Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The neogi 
targets one creature it can see within 30 feet ofit. The target 
must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically 
charmed by the neogi for l day, or until the neogi dies or is 
more than l mile from the target. The charmed target obeys 
the neogi's commands and can't take reactions, and the neogi 
and the target can communicate telepathically with each other 
at a distance of up to l mile. Whenever the charmed target 
takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect 
on itself on a success. 
Outside the obligations of a servant to its master, 
neogi are willing to engage in any activity that profits 
them, and they are as devious as devils when doing so. 
Neogi buy and sell, but they pose a grave risk to poten-
tial patrons that might instead be easily enslaved, so 
their customers generally consist of desperate or evil 
individuals, or creatures that are formidable enough 
to treat with the neogi as equals. Neogi traders might 
set up shop in a planar bazaar, on the edge of a drow 
city, or near a mind flayer enclave. In other locations, 
the natives are more likely to join together to destroy a 
neogi caravan than to allow it safe conduct and trading 
privileges.
