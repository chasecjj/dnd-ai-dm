When frost giants plan a raid on a nearby settlement 
or outpost, they time it to take place under the cover 
of a blizzard, believing the storm to be a sign from 
Thrym that the weak-boned humanoids are ready to be 
plundered, in the same way that a farmer might look at a 
rainstorm as a blessing from the harvest god. 
Frost giants recognize two kinds of loot: rod and kvit. 
Rod ("red") plunder consists of living creatures, either 
livestock or slaves. Kvit refers to material goods, the 
most prized being objects of steel, alcohol, and large 
gems. Frost giants like to grab gems for adorning their 
clothing, but ordinary currency is usually left behind 
after a raid. Tiny, round coins simply have no worth to a 
frost giant. 
Because frost giants can't stand the heat of a forge, 
they don't mine their own metal or craft their own 
weapons and armor. The fire-forged items of steel and 
iron that they wield and wear are prized as though they 
were made of gold. The giants are always on the lookout 
for such booty on their raids, but they don't often come 
across gear that is large enough for them to wear. Many 
of the giants in a tribe boast arms and armor handed 
don from their ancestors; others make do with items 
cobbled together from smaller parts. Shields sized for a 
human, for example, can be lashed together into a crude 
suit of scale armor; an anvil riveted onto a log serves as 
a warhammer. 
MASTERS OF BEASTS 
Frost giants dominate wild creatures both as evidence 
of their strength and to use them as hunting compan-
ions. They don't, however, have much grasp of animal 
husbandry, so their "pets" are bullied and beaten into 
submission more than they're trained. When a frost 
giant commands a beast to attack, it's less a command 
than an acknowledgment to the creature that the giant 
won't beat it for satisfying its hunger. A creature that 
proves willful or that resists "training" is fated to end up 
on the giant's dinner table. 
The roster of creatures in a frost giant lair can include 
polar bears, winter wolves, and mammoths, but the 
giants' most prized living possessions are remorhazes. 
Adult remorhazes are untrainable by anything short of 
powerful magical compulsion, but one taken as an egg 
can be trained as it is raised. In fact, remorhaz hatch-
lings are surprisingly pliant to the frost giants' manner 
of teaching by bullying. 
THRYM'S FRICID MIGHT
Thrym has long rivaled his twin brother Surtur for Annam's 
affection and pride. Frost giants pride themselves on 
Thrym's victories over Surtur and other legendary threats 
when he proved to have more strength or a steadier heart. 
Yet, Annam was swayed more by Surtur's well-crafted gifts 
than by the trophy heads Thrym laid at his feet. For this 
reason, frost giants bear more ill will toward Annam than 
most other giants do. 
Unlike his brothers, Thrym is seldom depicted alone. He 
is usually accompanied by up to ten shield-brothers and 
shield-sisters, heroic frost giants that won such great glory 
during the war between giants and dragons that Thrym 
granted them the honor of fighting forever at his side.
