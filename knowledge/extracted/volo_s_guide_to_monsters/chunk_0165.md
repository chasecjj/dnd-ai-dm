TRAPPER 
A trapper is a manta-like creature that lurks in subterra-
nean and natural environments. It can change the color 
and texture of its tough, outward-facing side to help it 
blend in with its surroundings, while its soft, inward-fac-
ing side clings to the floor, wall, or ceiling in its hunting 
territory. It remains motionless as it waits for prey to 
come close. When a target is within its reach, it peels 
itself away from the surface and wraps around its prey, 
crushing, smothering, and then digesting it. 
Versatile Camouflage. A trapper can alter the color 
and texture of its outer side to match its surroundings. 
It can blend in with any surface made of stone, earth, or 
wood, masking its presence to any but the most rigorous 
scrutiny. It can't change its texture to that of a grassy 
or snow-covered surface, but it can change its color to 
match and then conceal itself under a thin layer of vege-
tation or actual snow. 
Stationary Hunters. A trapper needs to eat about a 
halfling-sized meal once a week to remain sated. It is 
content to stay in one place, given a steady supply of 
food, and thus trappers are a threat along any well-trav-
eled dungeon corridor and on routes through the wil-
derness that see a lot of traffic. When prey is scarce, a 
trapper enters a state of hibernation that can last for 
months, though it is still aware when prey comes near. A 
trapper on the verge of starvation might defy its instincts 
and begin creeping along, abandoning its old territory in 
search of better hunting. 
Beware of Leftovers. When its prey is dead, a trapper 
dissolves and absorbs the fleshy parts, leaving a scatter-
ing of bones, metal, treasure, and other indigestible bits 
in the place wher~ the creature had been. A trapper that 
lurks on the floor of its hunting grounds can cover these 
remains with own body, making them look like irregu-
larities in the surface. The creature might also attach 
itself to a wall or a ceiling close to a recent kill, effec-
tively using the remnants as bait: a creature that stops to 
investigate the bones for valuables stands a good chance 
of becoming the trapper's next meal. 
guishable from an ordinary section of ceiling, floor, or wall. A 
creature that can see it and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) or Intelligence (Nature) check can discern 
its presence. 
Spider Climb. The trapper can climb difficult surfaces, includ· 
ing upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 
ACTIONS 
Smother. One Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of the 
trapper must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or 
be grappled (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the target 
takes 17 (4d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (ld6) acid dam-
age at the start of each of its turns. While grappled in this way, 
the target is restrained, blinded, and at risk of suffocating. The 
trapper can smother only one creature at a time.
