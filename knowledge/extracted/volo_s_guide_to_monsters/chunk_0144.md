the periapt and their preferred ritual site. Sometimes a 
single alhoon is entrusted with the periapt of mind trap-
ping, but this is a dangerous proposition. Anyone who 
holds the periapt of mind trapping gains advantage on 
attacks, saves, and check against the alhoons associated 
with its creation, and those alhoons in turn suffer disad-

VARIANT: MIND FLAYER LICH (ILLITHILICH) 
The path to true lichdom is something only the most pow-
erful mind flayer mages can pursue, since it requires the 
ability to craft a phylactery and cast the imprisonment spell. 
A mind flayer lich uses the lich stat block (see the Monster 
Manual), with the following changes: 
• It has a challenge rating of 22 (41,000 XP). 
• It speaks Deep Speech and Undercommon, and haste-
lepathy out to a range of 120 feet. 
• It has the Magic Resistance and Innate Spellcasting 
(Psionics) traits, as well as the Tentacles, Extract Brain, 
and Mind Blast action options (all described below}. So 
long as a mind flayer lich feeds captured souls to its phy-
lactery, it maintains the muscular power of its tentacles 
and the ability to extract brains. 
• Its suite of legendary actions (described below) is differ-
ent from that of the normal lich. 
Magic Resistance. The lich has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Innate Spel/casting (Psionics). The lich's innate spellcasting 
ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20). It can innately 
cast the following spells, requiring no components. 
At will: detect thoughts, levitote 
l /day each: dominate monster, plane shift (self only)

stunned until this grapple ends. 
Extract Brain. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 12 to hit, reach 5 ft., 
one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the lich. Hit: 55 
(lOdlO) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the tar-
get to O hit points, the lich kills the target by extracting and 
devouring its brain. 
Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The lich magically emits psy-
chic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area 
must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 
27 (5d8 + 5) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. 
A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each 
ofits turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The lich gains the following legendary action options, 
which replace all of the lich's legendary actions. 
Tentacles. The lich makes one attack with its tentacles. 
Extract Brain (Costs 2 Actions). The lich uses Extract Brain. 
Mind Blast (Costs 3 Actions). The lich recharges its Mind 
Blast and uses it.

cast a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell that it has prepared.
