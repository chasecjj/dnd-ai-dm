tion sufficiently, the illithids might move in en masse 
and attempt to turn the remaining followers into thralls. 
The process of transforming a creature into a thrall 
requires the entire colony's energy and attention, mak-
ing it no small matter. Although it takes only one mind 
flayer to perform the process, any illithid not directly 
involved in the process is required to donate its psionic 
power to the effort while otherwise remaining inactive. 
A thrall-to-be is first rendered docile through psionic 
means. Using a low-power version of its Mind Blast abil-
ity, the mind flayer bombards the victim with energy that 
washes through its synapses like acid, clearing away its 
former personality and leaving it a partially empty shell. 
This step takes 24 hours. Over the next 48 hours, the 
illithids rebuild the victim's memories and personality, 
and the victim gains the skills and talents it needs to 
perform its intended function. 
The process that creates a thrall changes almost 
everything about the victim. The creature retains its 
Hit Dice, hit points, racial traits (but not proficiencies 
granted by race), and all of its ability scores except for 
Intelligence. After the first stage of the process, the crea-
ture's Intelligence is halved; when the second stage is 
over, its Intelligence score increases by ld6. 
To complete the process, the thrall receives a new set 
of proficiencies, a new alignment, and a new personality. 
Some colonies have learned how to salvage a victim's 
psionic abilities during the process or how to implant 
psionic powers into their thralls. Also, some colonies 
know how to leave a victim's persona intact while infus-
ing it with a fanatical loyalty to the colony's elder brain 
as well as telepathic power that allows the victim to 
communicate with its new masters as if it were a mind 
flayer. This sort of thrall makes a perfect spy, since most 
would never suspect its true nature. 
A thrall can be restored to its former self through a 
combination of spells and ministration. The thrall must 
have regeneration, heal, and greater restoration cast on 
it once per day for three consecutive days. The victim is 
restored to normal when the final round of spells is cast. 
Mind flayers vastly prefer to use humanoids as thralls, 
since they have a good balance of physical attributes and 
proper anatomy. Animals, in contrast, require a lot of 
direct oversight and lack the ability to use tools to help 
maintain the colony. Among the variety of humanoids 
available to the illithids, they have some preferences and 
tendencies. 
DUERGAR 
Mind flayers have hated duergar ever since the gray 
dwarves revolted against them, but consider their brains 
a delicacy. Duergar serve as a constant reminder to the 
illithids that any creatures that serve them must be kept 
dimwitted and easily controlled. The clever duergar 
threw off the long-ago attempt by the mind flayers to rule 
them and have been enemies of the illithids ever since. 
GRIMLOCKS 
The first grimlocks were descended from humans cor-
rupted by mind flayers in ancient times, and today these 
sightless humanoids are among the illithids' preferred 
servants. Grimlocks are easily cowed by mind flayers, 
because their culture still centers on worship of and 
subservience to the illithids. Strong but dimwitted, they 
lack the initiative and the cunning to rebel as long as 
they are provided with food, shelter, and the opportunity 
to pillage and slay. Also, the grimlocks' inability to see 
gives their brains an exotic flavor that mind flayers love. 
Kuo-TOA 
Illithids once used kuo-toa as slaves extensively, since 
they proved quite easy to control. In time, though, re-
peated exposure to the mind flayers' psionic intrusions 
drove the kuo-toa mad. Nowadays, kuo-toa don't make 
for good thralls because their insanity makes them dif-
ficult to control. Mind flayers consider kuo-toa brains a 
great treat, but they prefer to eat them raw, unsullied by 
psionic alteration. Thus, they tend to eat kuo-toa soon af-
ter capturing them, rather than attempting to keep them 
penned up or docile. 
QUAGGOTHS 
Mind flayers find that the quaggoths' innate, though 
rarely manifested, talent for psionics makes them ex-
cellent thralls.'When possible, they manipulate a tribe's 
thonot (a psionic shaman) into pledging allegiance to a 
colony. Quaggoths are naturally strong and quick, mak-
ing them ideal shock troops without any additional mod-
ifications. The quaggoths' chaotic tendencies eventually 
motivate most colonies to convert them into thralls or 
food, rather than relying on the quaggoth thonot to keep 
them under control. 
HUMANOIDS 
Only the most desperate colonies bother using gob-
lins, kobolds, gnomes, and other small humanoids for 
anything except food. Small humanoids do make a 
good food source because they tend to gather in large 
groups, and their fear and despair in the face of a mind 
flayer incursion make their brains tasty to the illithid 
palate. They are also relatively easy for larger, stronger 
humanoid thralls to control. Small humanoids are only 
rarely transformed into thralls or otherwise kept under 
firm control. 
Almost any humanoid creature can end up as a thrall, 
and mind flayers sometimes work with whatever victims 
fall into their grasp. Aside from the exceptions dis-
cussed above, they tend to see ores, bugbears, humans, 
and other similar humanoids as largely interchangeable. 
Their brains all have a similar taste, and their utility as 
thralls is roughly equal.
