LEUCROTTA 
A leucrotta is what you would get if you took the head of 
a giant badger, the brain of a person who likes to torture 
and eat people, the legs of a deer, and the body of a large 
hyena, put them together, and reanimated them with 
demon ichor without bothering to cover up the stink 
of death. 
Spawn o[Yeenoghu. The first leucrottas came into 
being alongside the gnolls during Yeenoghu's rampages 
on the Material Plane. Some of the hyenas that ate Yee-
noghu's kills went through different transformations 
rather than turning into gnolls. Among these bizarre 
results, leucrottas were the most numerous. 
As clever as it is cruel, a leucrotta loves to deceive, 
torture, and kill. Because leucrottas are smarter and 
tougher than most gnolls, one could occupy an elevated 
position within a gnoll tribe. Although a leucrotta is 
unlikely to lead a group of gnolls, it can influence the 
leader, and it might even agree to carry a leader into bat-
tle and offer advice during the fight. 
Gnolls see leucrottas as a form of entertainment, 
partly because a leucrotta can mimic the squeals of 
a suffering victim- a sound that always gives gnolls 
pleasure- even when no victims are to be had. Further, 
a gnoll is bloodthirsty and sadistic, but unable by its 
nature to prolong the fun of killing. Most leucrottas are 
consciously cruel, to the point of being meticulous about 
their savagery to draw out a kill into better and longer 
sport. Gnolls enjoy watching a leucrotta work almost as 
much as they like doing their own killing. 
Foulness Embodied. The leucrotta is so loathsome 
that only gnolls and others of its kind can stand to be 
around one for long. Its horrific, hodgepodge body oozes 
a foul stench that pollutes anywhere the creature lairs. 
This reek is outdone only by the creature's breath, which 
issues from a maw that drips fluid corrupted with rot 
and digestive juices. In place of fangs, a leucrotta has 
bony ridges as hard as steel that can crush bones and 
lacerate flesh. These plates are so tough that a leucrotta 
can use them to peel plate armor away from the body of 
a slain knight. 
A leucrotta's stench would normally warn away prey 
long before the creature could attack. It has two 
natural capabilities, however, that give it an ad-
vantage. First, a leucrotta's tracks are nearly 
impossible to distinguish from those of com-
mon deer. Second, it can duplicate the call 
or the vocal expressions of just about any 
creature it has heard. The monster uses 
its mimicry to lure in potential victims, 
then attacks when they are confused or 
unaware of the actual threat.

with a melee attack on its turn, it can take a bonus action to 
move up to half its speed and make an attack with its hooves. 
ACTIONS

and one with its hooves. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

cal hit, it rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.
