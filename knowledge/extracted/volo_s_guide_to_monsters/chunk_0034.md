GOBLINOIDS: THE 
CONQUERING HOST 
Maglubiyet is truly the Conquering God. He stiffens the 
spines of cowardly goblins. He rouses bugbears from 
their lazy slumber. He sets the thunderous step of hob-
goblin legions. Maglubiyet takes·three races and turns 
them into one people. 
In bygone times the goblinoids were distinct from 
one another, with separate faiths and different cus-
toms. Then Maglubiyet came and conquered all who 
stood before him, mortals and deities alike. Gods and 
heroes who wouldn't bend to his will were broken and 
discarded. He put his foot on the neck of mighty Khur-
gorbaeyag, bound the will of intractable Hruggek, and 
forced sadistic Nomog-Geaya to fall in line. What the 
goblins, the bugbears, and the hobgoblins were before 
their gods bowed to Maglubiyet no longer matters. Now 
they are, first of all, followers of Maglubiyet. 
On the surface, goblins, bugbears, and hobgoblins are 
as different as halflings, dwarves, and elves. Each race 
has its own tendencies, outlook, culture, and gods. But 
Maglubiyet's hand joins them together, just as he made 
all their other gods parts within a greater whole. When 
one kind of goblinoid encounters another kind, the two 
groups don't see one another as strangers or foes. In-
stead they know that by the fact of their meeting alone, 
Maglubiyet has commanded them to come together. 
They know the time has come to form a host. 
GOBLINS 
Goblins occupy an uneasy place in a dangerous world, 
and they react by lashing out at any creatures they be-
lieve they can bully. Cunning in battle and cruel in vic-
tory, goblins are fawning and servile in defeat, just as in

their own society lower castes must scrape before those 
of greater status and as goblin tribes bow before other 
goblinoids. 
BEAST MASTERS AND SLAVE DRIVERS 
Goblins know they are a weak, unsophisticated race 
that can be easily dominated by bigger, smarter, more 
organized, more ferocious, or more magical creatures. 
Their god was conquered by Maglubiyet, after all, and 
now when the Mighty One calls for it, even their souls 
are forfeit. It is this realization that drives them to dom-
inate other creatures whenever they can-for goblins, 
life is short. 
Goblins seek to trap and enslave any creatures they 
encounter, but they flee from opposition that seems too 
daunting. For miles around their lair, they employ pit 
traps, snares, and nets to catch the unwary, and when 
their hunting patrols encounter other beings, they 
always look for ways to capture their foes instead of 
killing them. Goblins that run up against the fringes of 
a society first test its defenses by stealing objects, and if 
these crimes go unpunished, they begin stealing people. 
Enslaved creatures receive the worst treatment the 
goblins can dish out while still getting decent perfor-
mance out of the slaves. But humanoids and monsters 
that are especially capable or that provide unusual ser-
vices find themselves treated like favored (though occa-
sionally abused) pets. 
KHURGORBAEYAG: THE OVERSEER OF ALL 
Goblins once had many gods, but the only one who sur-
vived Maglubiyet's ascendancy is cruel Khurgorbaeyag, 
known as the Overseer. Khurgorbaeyag drives his worship-
ers to be the masters of others. Only by wielding the whip 
can they hope to escape its lash. Khurgorbaeyag some-
times makes his presence or his desires known through 
wrathful signs and magical blessings: the crack of a whip 
without a visible source, chains or ropes that move of their 
own accord, or a glowing cage that appears to trap foes or 
those who displease him. Worshipers of Khurgorbaeyag 
are sometimes overtaken by sudden onsets of depres-
sion, which they take as a sign that they have somehow 
displeased their god. When they rouse themselves from 
this despondency, they take up the master's whip with re-
newed zeal and seek out more creatures upon which they 
can wield it. 
Khurgorbaeyag's holy symbol is a yellow-and-red striped 
whip made of leather. This mark of his authority is used by 
its wielder against goblins of a lower caste as well as on 
slaves and enemies. The knowledge of how to make such 
a whip is enough to elevate a goblin to the master caste 
oflashers. Often the secret is guarded by one family in a 
tribe, which enjoys prestige and influence because it con-
trols the supply of whips.
