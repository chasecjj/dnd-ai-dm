Birth names are rarely linked to gender. Goliaths see 
females and males as equal in all things, and they find 
societies with roles divided by gender to be puzzling or 
worthy of mockery. To a goliath, the person who is best 
at a job should be the one tasked with doing it. 
A goliath's nickname is a description that can change 
on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a 
notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by 
the goliath. Goliaths assign and use nicknames with 
their friends of other races, and change them to refer to 
an individual's notable deeds. 
Goliaths present all three names when identifying 
themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, 
and clan name. In casual conversation, they use 
their nickname.

GOLIATH TRAITS 
Goliaths share a number of traits in common with 
each other. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score 
increases by 2, and your Constitution score in-
creases by 1. 
Al,e. Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans. 
They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live 
less than a century. 
Alignment. Goliath society, with its clear roles and 
tasks, has a strong lawful bent. The goliath sense of fair-
ness, balanced with an emphasis on self-sufficiency and 
personal accountability, pushes them toward neutrality. 
Size. Goliaths are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh 
between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium. 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Natural Athlete. You have proficiency in the Ath-
letics skill. 
Stone's Endurance. You can focus yourself to occa-
sionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you 
can use your reaction to roll a dl2. Add your Constitu-
tion modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the dam-
age by that total. After you use this trait, you can't use it 
again until you finish a short or long rest. 
Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when 
determining your carrying capacity and the weight you 
can push, drag, or lift. 
Mountain Born. You're acclimated to high altitude, 
including elevations above 20,000 feet. You're also natu-
rally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 
of the Dungeon Master's Guide. 
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and Giant. 
KENKU 
THE MAP WE FOUND SHOWED THE ENTRANCE TO THE 
Priest King's treasure cache right in the middle of the ruined 
section of the city. We approached our destination,without 
issue, but as we arrived at the burned-out building, a sud-
den cacophony erupted around us. Birds squawked, cats 
hissed, and dogs growled. Lidda hustled us back to the city's 
safer avenues. On/y when we were back within the area 
patrolled by the guard did she explain that the noises indi-
cated that the wingless folk had claimed that area, and that 
to trespass would be to court death. 
-Gimble, Notes from a Treasure Hunter 
Haunted by an ancient crime that robbed them of their 
wings, the kenku wander the world as vagabonds and 
burglars who live at the edge of human society. Kenku 
suffer from a sinister reputation that is not wholly un-
earned, but they can prove to be valuable allies. 
AN ANCIENT CURSE 
· The kenku once served a mysterious, powerful entity on 
another plane of existence. Some believe they were min-
ions of Grazz't, while others say that they were scouts 
and explorers for the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Whatever 
the truth, according to legend, the kenku betrayed their 
master. Unable to resist the lure of a beautiful sparkling 
treasure, the kenku plotted to steal the item and escape 
to the Material Plane. 
Unfortunately for the kenku, their master discovered 
their plan before they could enact it. Enraged, the en-
tity imposed three dreadful curses upon them. First, 
the kenku's beloved wings withered and fell away from 
their bodies, leaving them bound to the earth. Second, 
because their ingenuity and skill had turned toward 
scheming against their patron, the spark of creativity 
was torn from their souls. Finally, to ensure that the 
kenku could never divulge any secrets, their master took 
away their voices. Once the entity was satisfied that they 
had been sufficiently punished, the kenku were set loose 
on the Material Plane. 
Since then, the kenku have wandered the world. 
They settle in places that accept them, usually bleak 
cities that have fallen on hard times and are overrun 
with crime. 
DREAMS OF FLIGHT 
Above all else, kenku wish to regain their ability to fly. 
Every kenku is born with a desire to take to the air, and 
those who learn spellcasting do so in hope of mastering 
spells that will allow them to fly. Rumors of magic items 
such as flying carpets, brooms capable of flight, and 
similar objects provoke a great desire for the kenku to 
acquire the items for themselves. 
Despite their lack of wings, kenku love dwelling in 
towers and other tall structures. They seek out ruins 
that reach to the sky, though they lack the motivation 
and creativity to make repairs or fortify such places.
