MIND BLADE 
Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement by a spe-
cific individual) 
Mind flayers can turn any nonmagical sword into a mind 
blade. Only one creature can attune to it: either a spe-
cific mind flayer or one of its thralls. In the hands of any 
other creature, the mind blade functions as a normal 
sword of its kind. In the hands of its intended wielder, 
the mind blade is a magic weapon that deals an extra 
2d6 psychic damage to any target it hits. 
MIND CARAPACE ARMOR 
Armor (any heavy armor), uncommon (requires attune-
ment by a specific individual) 
Any nonmagical suit of heavy armor can be turned 
by mind flayers into mind carapace armor. Only one 
creature can attune to it: either a specific mind flayer 
or one of its thralls. While worn by any other creature, 
the mind carapace armor functions as normal armor 
of its kind. To its intended wearer, the armor grants ad-
vantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving 
throws and makes its wearer immune to the frightened 
condition. 
MIND LASH 
Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement by a mind 
flayer) 
In the hands of a creature other than a mind flayer, a 
mind lash functions as a normal whip. In the hands of 
an illithid, this magic weapon strips away a creature's 
will to survive as it also strips away flesh, dealing an 
extra 2d4 psychic damage to any target it hits. Any crea-
ture that takes psychic damage from the mind lash must 
also succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have 
disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 
saving throws for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the 
effect on itself on a success. 
SHIELD OF FAR SIGHT 
Annor (shield), rare 
A mind flayer skilled at crafting magic items creates a 
shield of far sight by harvesting an eye from an intelli-
gent humanoid and magically implanting it on the outer 
surface of a nonmagical shield. The shield becomes a 
magic item once the eye is implanted, whereupon the 
mind flayer can give the shield to a thrall or hang it on 
a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is on the same 
plane of existence as its creator, the mind flayer can see 
through the shield's eye, which has darkvision out to a 
range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical 
eye, the mind flayer can use its Mind Blast action as 
though it were standing behind the shield. 
If a shield of far sight is destroyed, the mind flayer that 
created it is blinded for 2d12 hours. 
MIND FLAYER AUGMENTATIONS 
Some mind flayer colonies augment their thralls with 
nonmagical gear to make them more effective as lair 
guardians and bodyguards. Two examples of mind flayer 
augmentations are presented here. 
FLENSING CLAWS 
Illithids don't always provide their thralls with normal 
weapons, such as swords and axes. Sometimes they 
improve the natural capabilities of thralls by giving 
them new anatomy. Flensing claws take the form of ar-
ticulated digits that extend into long metal blades. The 
claws are knitted into the flesh and bones of a creature's 
arms and can't be removed without surgical amputation. 
Each set of flensing claws is designed for a specific 
creature and can't be used by anyone else. A creature 
equipped with flensing claws can use its action to make 
one melee weapon attack with the claws. The claws 
deal slashing damage based on the creature's size: 
Small, ld8; Medium, ldlO; Large, ld12; or Huge, 2d8. 
The creature adds its proficiency bonus and Strength 
modifier to any attack roll made with the claws, and its 
Strength modifier to its damage roll when it hits a target 
with the claws. Tiny and Gargantuan creatures can't be 
fitted with flensing claws. 
SURVIVAL MANTLE 
This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of 
the wearer's shoulders, neck, and chest. A survival man-
tle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half plate armor 
and takes just as long to don or doff. It can't be worn 
with other kinds of armor. 
A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe 
normally in any environment (including a vacuum) and 
has advantage on saving throws against harmful gases 
(such as those created by a cloudkill spell, a stinking 
cloud spell, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of 
some dragons). 
TREASURE 
Mind flayers don't hoard coins, gemstones, jewelry, and 
other sorts of treasure. However, a colony obsessed 
with the study of biology would consider a new, alien 
specimen a great prize, especially a living creature. One 
concerned with improving its war machinery might seek 
out new gear, weapons, and armor it can use. A colony 
that collects gold coins or gemstones might do so not to 
become rich but to contaminate them with a psychic ef-
fect it wants to spread through the surface world. 
Adventurers who are motivated by the prospect of 
vast wealth are best off avoiding mind flayer colonies. 
Although illithids are evil, and defeating them makes 
the world a safer place, they don't accumulate material 
wealth the way many other powerful creatures do. Be-
cause of their disdain for arcane and divine power, they 
discount most magic items as trivial baubles, unless 
they are useful to the colony for a particular reason. A 
mind flayer might ignore a bag of diamonds it is offered 
as a bribe, but might listen to a proposal if a bargaining 
creature offers it news of a new construction technique 
developed by the dwarves of a faraway kingdom. 
Mind flayers know that humans, ores, and other prim-
itive creatures love shiny baubles and mysterious de-
vices. They might use such objects they come across the 
way a rat catcher uses a lump of cheese-a lure to draw 
quarry into a trap.
