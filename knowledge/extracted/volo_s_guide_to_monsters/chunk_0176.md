YUAN-TI P IT MASTER 
Pit masters are yuan-ti malison priests that have made 
a pact with the god Merrshaulk and seek to rouse him 
from his slumber by sacrificing humanoids to him. They 
are the most traditionalist in attitude among yuan-ti and 
believe that they are best equipped to achieve the goals 
of their people. 
Pit masters are deeply involved in the race's long-term 
plan to take over humanoid governments, as well as in 
the ongoing effort to protect their cities from discovery 
or attacks by hostiles. They oppose reckless behavior 
and argue for a slow, cautious approach in all matters. 
This malison is the type that has a human head and 
body and snakes for arms.
