DEMONS 
Demon lords create lesser demons for the purpose of 
spreading chaos and terror throughout the multiverse. 
Three such demons are described here. 
BABAU 
Demons and devils clash endlessly for control of the 
Lower Planes. One of these battles pitted the legions of 
the archdevil Glasya against the screaming hordes of 
the demon lord Graz'zt. It is said that Glasya wounded 
Graz'zt with her sword, and the first babaus arose where 
his blood struck the ground. Their sudden appearance 
helped rout Glasya and secured Graz'zt's place as one of 
the preeminent demon lords of the Abyss. 
A babau demon possesses the cunning of a devil and 
the bloodthirstiness of a demon. It has leathery black 
skin pulled tight over its gaunt frame, and a curved horn 
protruding from the back of its elongated skull. A ba-
bau's baleful glare can weaken a creature. 
MAW DEMON 
Maw demons share Yeenoghu's ceaseless hunger for 
carnage and mortal flesh. After a maw demon rests for 
8 hours, anything devoured by it is transported directly 
into the Lord of Savagery's gullet. 
Maw demons appear among gnoll war bands, usually 
summoned as part of ritual offerings of freshly slain hu-
manoids made to Yeenoghu. The gnolls don't command 
them, but these demons accompany the war band and 
attack whatever creatures the gnolls fall upon. 
SHOOSUVA 
A shoosuva is a hyena-demon gifted by Yeenoghu to an 
especially powerful gnoll (typically as a fang ofYeeno-
ghu). A shoosuva manifests shortly after a war band 
achieves a great victory, emerging from a billowing, fetid 
cloud of smoke as it arrives from the Abyss. In battle, 
the demon wraps its slavering jaws around one victim 
while lashing out with the poisonous stinger on its tail to 
bring down another one. A creature immobilized by the 
poison becomes easy pickings for any gnolls nearby. 
Each shoosuva is bonded to a particular gnoll and 
fights alongside its master. A gnoll that has been gifted 
with a shoosuva is second only to a flind in status within 
a war band.

ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The babau makes two melee attacks. It can also 
use Weakening Gaze before or after making these attacks. 
\
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 8 (ld8 + 4) slashing damage. 
Spear. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or 
range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (ld6 + 4) piercing damage, 
or 8 (ld8 + 4) piercing damage when used with two hands to 
make a melee attack. 
Weakening Gaze. The babau targets one creature that it can 
see within 20 feet ofit. The target must make a DC 13 Consti-
tution saving throw. On a failed save, the target deals only half 
damage with weapon attacks that use Strength for l minute. 
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
