XVART SPEAKERS 
A xvart tribe has one speaker that serves as its leader. The 
speaker has the statistics of a normal xvart, except that it 
has an Intelligence of 13 (+ 1) and knows one additional 
language (usually Common or Goblin). 
Vermin Masters. Rats and bats (including giant-sized 
specimens) are naturally attracted to xvarts, and xvarts 
domesticate such beasts for food and battle. Xvarts also 
form alliances with wererats, although the lycanthropes 
are dominant in any such arrangement. This rela-
tionship traces back to Raxivort's divine nature. Even 
though the xvarts inherited Raxivort's greed and cow-
ardice, they also gained his ability to form bonds with 
such creatures. 
Xvart Warlocks. A xvart can forge a pact with Rax-
ivort by stealing an item of such great value that the 
demigod himself appears before the xvart to claim it. Af-
ter surrendering the item to Raxivort, the xvart asks for 
magical power so that it can find and deliver more great 
treasures into Raxivort's custody. If the demigod feels 
so inclined, he imbues the xvart with greater wisdom 
and charisma and grants it the spellcasting abilities 
of a warlock before returning to the howling chaos of 
Pandemonium. Raxivort's warlocks are respected and 
feared in xvart society, but they have little interest in po-
litical power. They scour the wilderness, old ruins, and 
dungeons for treasures, often with a handful of xvart 
sycophants and giant rat bodyguards in tow.
