MIND FLAYER MONSTERS 
Mind flayers hardly ever use non-humanoid creatures as 
thralls or develop other relationships with them. Most of 
them are either too big and strong to keep penned up for 
long or too limited in intellect to complete anything but 
the simplest tasks. In general, non-humanoids found in 
the company of mind flayers are those that the illithids 
have created or bred for specific purposes. A few types 
ofthese creatures warrant special mention. 
INTELLECT DEVOURERS 
Almost every mind flayer colony creates intellect de-
vourers and seeds the areas around its lair with a few 
to keep watch, slay intruders, and lure fresh victims to 
their doom. 
MINDWITNESSES 
A mindwitness represents an exception to the typical 
mind flayer pattern of reproduction. If a colony suc-
ceeds in capturing and subduing a beholder, it can use 
a tadpole to convert the creature into a bizarre hybrid 
known as a mindwitness. A mindwitness is a sort of 
psychic hub, able to collect and amplify the illithids' 
psionic power. 
See chapter 3 of this book for more information on 
mind witnesses. 
NEOTHELIDS 
These horrors, hated by mind flayers, sometimes come 
into being when those ignorant of mind flayer lore de-
stroy a colony. A neothelid arises when a tadpole pool 
is left untended. The tadpoles turn against each other, 
and the survivor grows to immense size. Comparable to 
purple worms, these behemoths devour everything in 
their path. 
See chapter 3 of this book for more information on 
neothelids. 
MIND FLAYER LAIRS 
In the lair of a mind flayer colony, the safety and security 
of its residents is all-important. As a result, illithid lairs 
are always well hidden and well defended, almost al-
ways underground, and within easy reach of humanoids 
and their succulent brains. 
No two lairs are the same, as the resident elder brain 
drives the form and function of each one. The lair shown 
in the accompanying map is typical and includes many 
elements found in every colony's stronghold. 
The illithids, with their ability to levitate, design major 
portions of their lairs so as to make movement as dif-
ficult as possible for ordinary two-legged creatures. In 
such locations, thralls must climb or use ropes to move 
from place to place. 
BRAIN CHAMBER 
Mind flayers sometimes preserve extracted brains in a 
magical liquid. Still fully alive, they are kept in the brain 
chamber. The mind flayers use these brains to advance 
the study of how psionics affects their enemies. They 
also enjoy the babble of confused, horrified thoughts 
that emanates from these sources, and sometimes sit 
here in quiet, comfortable contemplation. Brains that

prove boring or dull are evefttually consumed, while the 
most interesting ones are added to the brain library. 
BRAIN LIBRARY 
Extracted brains that are exceptional in some way are 
kept in the colony's brain library. Here, the mind flayers 
continue their examinations at a much greater depth. 
CLEANSING CHAMBERS 
Freshly captured victims are processed in the cleansing 
chambers. Their gear is removed and either destroyed 
or kept if it is of interest, their hair is shaved to prevent 
parasites, and any sickly ones are disposed of. 
COMMON ROOM 
The lair's common room serves as a gathering spot for 
the colony's thralls. As they complete tasks, they come 
here to rest, eat, and wait for new orders. Any mind 
flayer in need of assistance can visit this room to obtain 
the needed muscle power. In the event of an attack, 
the thralls gather here to arm themselves and ready 
for battle. 
ELDER BRAIN RESTING POOL 
Usually centrally located, the lair's resting pool is where 
the elder brain holds court in its brine pool, protected 
by a nearly impenetrable layer of a glass-like substance 
that blocks all attacks except for psionic abilities. The 
elder brain relaxes here, and often assembles the colony 
members to engage in debates on philosophy and the 
nature of the planes. This particular colony's elder brain 
is something of a bully, and has been known to destroy 
illithids that outwit it in discussions. 
GUARDROOMS 
Chambers on the perimeter of the lair are continually 
staffed by heavily armed thralls, constructs, and other 
watchers. The inhabitants of these rooms attack strang-
ers on sight and sound an alarm. Any entrance to a lair 
is always hidden by a secret door, an illusion, or some 
other barrier. 
lLLITHID QUARTERS 
Each member of the colony claims a single room or a 
small series of chambers at its own and uses the space 
to conduct its personal research. One illithid's quarters 
might contain musical instruments and thralls with me-
lodious voices; another might have cages of specimens 
that teem with a variety of diseases the mind flayers 
are studying. 
LIBRARY (AND DISSECTION CHAMBER) 
The library in a mind flayer lair isn't a collection of 
books, but an array of still-living organs kept in the 
same fluid that enables them to keep brains alive. The 
mind flayers study the organs to refine their experi-
ments. Failed experiments from the transformation 
chamber eventually are brought here to be dissected so 
that their organs can be added to the library's contents. 
PRISON 
The results of failed experiments from the transforma-
tion chamber are dumped into cages and cells in the 
prison, to prevent them from getting underfoot else-
where in the lair: They are eventually processed in the 
nearby library. 
TADPOLE CHAMBERS 
The elder brain dictates that populations of tadpoles be 
kept in smaller pools under guard, away from the brine 
pool. Should the brine pool be destroyed in an attack, 
these tadpoles stand a better chance of survival. 
TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER 
The transformation chamber contains a number of 
small cells. The subjects of promising experiments are 
kept here, bombarded with psionic energy in an effort 
to warp their physical development. Most creatures 
that undergo this process are turned into twisted, crip-
pled wretches, but a few emerge stronger and tougher 
than before. 
NAUTILOIDS 
Mind flayers employ bizarre flying ships called nauti-
loids. Able to move through the Astral Plane, nautiloids 
can also transport mind flayers between the various 
worlds of the Material Plane. 
A nautiloid looks like an enormous conch shell fitted 
with an exterior deck and a large mass of rubbery tenta-
cles. Ages ago, when the mind flayers could fly through 
the worlds of the Material Plane without resistance, 
they used the nautiloid's tentacles to scour the surface 
for interesting creatures to take back home for study or 
a feasting. 
The most notable feature of a nautiloid is its ability to 
move directly from one world to another in the Material 
Plane. Normally, travelers must venture to Sigil, a city in 
the Outer Planes, and find a doorway leading to the spe-
cific world t~ey seek. But mind flayers can use nautiloids 
to move between worlds without going through Sigil. By 
this means, they have been able to spread themselves 
out into almost every corner of the multiverse. 
Nowadays, a nautiloid is an incredibly rare sight. A 
colony in possession of one takes great care to keep it 
hidden, taking to the sky only out of necessity. Word of a 
nautiloid seen soaring through the air travels quickly in 
almost every world and is likely to attract the attention 
of vengeful githyanki and githzerai. A gith hunting party 
counts a nautiloid as the greatest prize it can claim, 
above even an elder brain. 
The illithids have lost the secret of manufacturing 
nautiloids, meaning that the loss of any vessel brings 
them one step closer to remaining trapped on the Mate-
rial Plane. 
OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE USES 
A colony that has access to a nautiloid uses it as a 
weapon only in rare circumstances, perhaps as part of 
the final phase of a plan to subvert, destroy, or control 
an enemy. Nautiloids move quietly and are almost im-
possible to detect in the darkness. A sudden strike, with 
the ship disgorging mind flayers and thralls to finish the 
assault after it lands, can reduce an enemy settlement to 
ruins in a single night.
