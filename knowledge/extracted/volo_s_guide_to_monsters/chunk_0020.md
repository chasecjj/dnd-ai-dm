framed in gold leaf, rare perfume stored in vials of crys-

tapestry composed entirely of pearls. 
Another way for a family to demonstrate its wealth 
is by bestowing lavish gifts on other families. (A gift 
from one family member to another doesn't prove any-
thing about the family's largesse.) No cloud giant truly 
believes that it's better to give than to receive; a family 
does so only with an eye toward how the giving can el-
evate its status. Memnor and his trickery play a role in 
this "game." The very best gift (from the giver's perspec-
tive) is one that everyone believes to be far more valu-
able than it truly is. Only the giver and the receiver will 
ever know a gift's true value, and neither of them would 
ever reveal that a gift is worth less than it appears to be, 
because to do so would reduce the status of both. 
Wealth also changes hands between cloud giants 
when they indulge their obsession for gambling and 
wagering. Cloud giants don't engage in betting for en-
joyment; it is less a form of entertainment than a type of 
bloodless feud. No cloud giant is a good loser, and one 
would be aghast to hear someone else say, "I lost 40 
pounds of gold, but I had a good time." Betting wars be-
tween families can go on for generations, with fortunes 
and estates (and the position in the ordning that goes 
with them) passing back and forth repeatedly. What a 
parent loses, a child hopes someday to win back, plus 
more; what the child wins back, a grandchild probably 
will eventually lose again. The tales that cloud giants 
tell of their ancestors are seldom about wars or magic 
or battles against dragons-they're about brilliant wa-
gers won through boldness or deceit, and rival families 
brought to disgrace and ruin by the same. 
MASKS OF NOBILITY 
Ancient depictions of Memnor often showed him wear-
ing a two-faced mask. Because of this, cloud giant no-
bles seldom show their faces, but instead wear exquisite 
masks made of precious materials adorned with gem-
stones. Each noble has a collection of these masks that 
it wears to conceal its face but still reflect its current 
mood; an individual might change masks many times 
during the day as its emotions shift. 
A mask is prized both for its material value and for its 
accuracy in expressing the mood it represents. Only the 
Two FACES OF MEMNOR 
The chief deity of cloud giants is Memnor, the cleverest of 
Annam's offspring. But Memnor isn't only clever, he's sly 
and deceitful. Tales of his exploits emphasize his charisma, 
his smooth manner, and his ability to manipulate and 
mislead his siblings and other legendary figures into doing 
exactly what he wants, usually to their great detriment. 
Thus, cloud giants have two distinct aspects of Memnor 
to admire and emulate. Those of a benign disposition 
revere him for his charm, intelligence, and persuasive-
ness, while those of a more malign bent take Memnor's 
self-interest to heart and imitate his trickery. Cloud giants 
that take a particular interest in trickery, known as "smil-
ing ones," wear two-faced masks as they practice their 
deceptions and prey on those who are susceptible to their 
charms. Statistics for cloud giant smiling ones appear in 
chapter 3 of this book.

richest of cloud giants can afford the dozens of masks 
necessary to show all the subtle differences in emotion 
possible among their kind. Artisans who can sculpt and 
craft masks that meet the cloud giants' exacting stan-
dards in such matters are richly rewarded for their skill. 
FIRE GIANTS 
The fire giants were the officers, engineers, and craft· 
ers of ancient Ostoria. Their position and unparalleled 
skill, along with their domineering outlook, make them 
haughty and arrogant. 
0RDNING OF CRAFTWORK 
Fire giants are the greatest smiths, architects, and tech-
nicians among giantkind. The iron-lined halls of a fire 
giant stronghold, deep inside a mountain or a volcano, 
support the unimaginable weight of the stone above 
them and enable the giants to harness the heat of rivers 
of magma to power their forges. 
A fire giant's prowess in the occupations of crafting 
determines its place in the ordning. Although fire giants 
put stock in combat skill, they recognize that success 
in battle or on the hunt derives mainly from the quality 
of one's weapons and armor, and those that can fashion 
the finest gear enjoy the highest status in the clan. Mas-
ter artisans, architects, and engineers select the best 
disciples to pass their knowledge on to, along with their 
standing. Often pupils are children or siblings of their 
teachers, but that's not always so. Leaders are chosen 
by general recognition from among the best crafters 
in the clan. 
One group of fire giants, known as the dreadnoughts, 
owe their place in the ordning not to their crafting abil-
ity but to their extraordinary physical prowess. They 
take on a lot of the work of guarding the forges and 
keeping them stoked-effort without which the crafters 
couldn't succeed. (See chapter 3 of this book for more 
information on fire giant dreadnoughts.) 
Fire giants don't spend a lot of time crafting works of 
art, although they would maintain that all of their feats 
of metalworking and engineering are themselves forms 
of artistic expression. Beyond such accomplishments, 
true artwork is scarce among fire giants, and most of 
what exists is jewelry, made from gems and ore that they 
mine and then refine. A unique form of art that some fire 
giants produce involves manipulating magma as it cools, 
forming it into fantastical, one-of-a-kind shapes. The 
most striking of these works are collected and displayed 
inside the stronghold, not unlike how other cultures cre-
ate topiary gardens.
