Creature Sense. The ulitharid is aware of the presence of crea-
tures within 2 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or 
higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, 
as well as each creature's Intelligence score, but can't sense 
anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank 
spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived 
in this manner. 
Magic Resistance. The ulitharid has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. 
Psionic Hub. If an elder brain establishes a psychic link with the 
ulitharid, the elder brain can form a psychic link with any other 
creature the ulitharid can detect using its Creature Sense. Any 
such link ends if the creature falls outside the telepathy ranges 
of both the ulitharid and the elder brain. The ulitharid can 
maintain its psychic link with the elder brain regardless of the 
distance between them, so long as they are both on the same 
plane of existence. If the ulitharid is more than 5 miles away 
from the elder brain, it can end the psychic link at any time (no 
action required). 
Innate Spel/casting (Psionics). The ulitharid's innate spellcast-
ing ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast 
the following spells, requiring no components: 
At will: detect thoughts, levitate 
1/day each: confusion, dominate monster, eyebite.feeblemind, 
mass suggestion, plane shift (self only), project image, scrying, 
telekinesis 
ACTIONS 
Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
creature. Hit: 27 (4dl0 + 5) psychic damage. If the target is 
Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 14) and must suc-
ceed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until 
this grapple ends. 
Extract Brain. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
incapacitated humanoid grappled by the ulitharid. Hit: 55 
(lOdlO) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 
0 hit points, the ulitharid kills the target by extracting and de-
vouring its brain. 
Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The ulitharid magically emits psy-
chic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must 
succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or take 31 (4dl2 
+ 5) psychic damage and be stunned for l minute. A target can 
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending 
the effect on itself on a success.

ULITHARID 
Very rarely, a tadpole from an elder brain's brine pool 
transforms an individual into an ulitharid, a larger and 
more potent mind flayer that boasts six tentacles. 
Master Minds. Illithids innately recognize that an uli-
tharid's survival is more important than their own. An 
elder brain's reaction to the rise of an ulitharid varies. 
In most colonies, the ulitharid becomes an elder brain's 
most favored servant, invested with power and authority. 
In others, the elder brain perceives an ulitharid as a po-
tential rival for power, and it manipulates or quashes the 
ulitharid's ambitions accordingly. 
Birth ofa Colony. When an ulitharid finds sharing 
leadership with an elder brain to be insufferable, it 
breaks off from the colony, taking a group of mind 
flayers with it, and moves to another location to form a 
new colony. After the death of the ulitharid's body, mind 
flayers take its brain and place it in a brine pool, where 
it grows into an elder brain over a few days. This pro-
cess doesn't work on the brain of an ulitharid that dies a 
natural death, as a brain that succumbs to old age is too 
decrepit to be used in the creation of an elder brain. 
Extractor Staff. Each ulitharid carries a psionically 
enhanced staff made of black metal. When the ulitharid 
is ready to give up its life, it attaches the staff to the back 
of its head, and the staff cracks open its skull and peels 
it apart, enabling its brain to be extracted. The brain and 
the staff are then planted in the ulitharid's corpse, caus-
ing it to dissolve into ichor. This psionically potent slime 
helps to fuel the transformation of the area into a brine 
pool that surrounds an embryonic elder brain.
