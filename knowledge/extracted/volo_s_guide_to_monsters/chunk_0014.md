in the organization. Among these are the beholder's 
accountant, chamberlain, chief messenger, doctor, 
fish-keeper, fortune-teller, lawyer, master entertainer, 
monster trainer, trap-setter, and warden for its private 
prison. The individuals in these roles generally serve 
the Xanathar for months or years, because replace-
ments that have the same specialized skills can be hard 
to come by. 
WHAT OTHERS KNOW 
The organization's grunt-level employees-thieves, sla-
vers, and ordinary thugs-work for the Xanathar Guild 
because it pays well. They don't necessarily know their 
leader is a beholder; they just know the boss is powerful, 
dangerous, and doesn't tolerate mistakes. Although pre-
vious Xanathars carefully guarded the facts of their true 
nature and allowed only a handful of their lieutenants to 
know the truth, the current Xanathar treats the matter 
more like an open secret. All of its lieutenants, as well 
as many mid-level members of the guild that the Xana-
thar trusts, know that the guild is run by a beholder. 
Most of the guild's low-ranking members have an idea 
that the boss isn't human, especially given how long 
the Xanathar has been in power {they aren't aware that 
several beholders have held the job). Most believe their 
leader is a member of a long-lived race, perhaps a dwarf 
or an elf. Some think the truth is more monstrous, and 
that the Xanathar is a drow or perhaps a dragon in hu-
manoid form. 
The people ofWaterdeep are generally aware that 
there are one or more guilds controlling criminal ac-
tivity in the city. Rumors occasionally surface about a 
monstrous crime lord, such as a demon or a dragon, that 
guides its organization from the shadows. Most com-
mon folk dismiss these rumors and the fools who circu-
late them, asserting that the Lords ofWaterdeep would 
never allow such creatures to roam the city. 
GIANTS: WORLD SHAKERS 
The saga of giantkind began in the dawn of the world. 
Elves had yet to set dainty foot out of the fey realm when 
the thunder of the giants' steps shook the world to its 
bones, and even the dragons were yet unaware of the 
power and glory they would attain. The record of that 
early age had already vanished into the mists of legend 
by the time humankind came onto the scene. Now, not 
even the giants know the full truth of their beginnings. 
All that the giants and their kin know for certain is 
that they are sibling races. Humanoids such as elves, hu-
mans, and dwarves are more similar in size and shape 
than the disparate giant types are to one another, but 
those races have no shared heritage. In contrast, every 
true giant, regardless of type, can trace its ancestry 
directly to Annam the All-Father. Most giants believe 
that Annam took a number of consorts in addition to his 
mate Othea, accounting for the variety in appearance 
and abilities among the types of giantkind. 
Giants and giant kin rank among the world's most 
fearsome creatures, literally towering over the other, 
younger beings that crowd the world. Yet nowadays 
most giants live in isolation or in obscure locations, 
exhibiting none of the collective grandeur and power of 
their forebears. 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
Encountering a giant can be an awe-inspiring and dis-
orienting experience. First comes a rhythmic booming, 
felt more than heard, that resolves slowly into the sound 
of footsteps: a giant is near! Loose stones vibrate and 
tumble down the hillside. Trees sway, then bend aside 
as the colossus emerges. How can anything be that big? 
Is it a trick of perspective? 
When giants first appear before a band of adventurers, 
they demonstrate the qualities that make them spectac-
ular to behold: 
Giants Are Huge. Most giants can easily peer in a sec-
ond-floor window. The larger ones would· have to stoop 
to get down to that level! A giant's metal hammer 
could serve as an anvil for a human smith, and a gi-
ant's shield is bigger and heavier than a feasting table. 
Giants Are Heavy. If a giant sits on a wagon, its wheels 
and axles are liable to snap like twigs. A giant can 
crush a house or capsize a ship simply by carelessly 
shifting its weight. An ox that strays too close to a 
sleeping giant could wind up pinned or crushed if the 
giant rolls over suddenly. 
Giants Are Loud. The footsteps of giants in the dis-
tance are often initially mistaken for thunder, even on 
a clear day. The sounds of a giant beating a weapon 
against its shield and bellowing a challenge to foes are 
strident enough to knock dishes from shelves and rat-
tle doors in their frames. 
Giants Are Strong. A charging warhorse at full gallop, 
capable of bowling over a line of human warriors, 
merely crumples against the bulk of a giant. A giant 
could kick a cart with enough force to send it smash-
ing through a house, and a giant's club-the size of, 
if not actually, an entire tree- could level the same 
house with a single blow. 
CHILDREN OF THE ALL-FATHER 
In an age before human and elf, when all dragons were 
young, Annam the All-Father put the first giants upon 
the world. These giants were reflections of his divine off-
spring and also children of the world, birthed from the 
marrow of mountains, the hot blood of volcanoes, and 
the breath of hurricanes. 
Annam conceived the giants to be masters of the 
world. He gave them great height so they would look 
down on all they ruled. He created a hierarchy for his 
children- the ordning- so that all would know their 
status with respect to one another, and would know who 
among them stood nearest the knee of the All-Father. 
United in purpose, Annam's children built Ostoria, the 
fabled empire of the giants, where they lived according
