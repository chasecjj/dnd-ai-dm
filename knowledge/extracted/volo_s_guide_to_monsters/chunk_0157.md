0RC HAND OF YURTRUS 
Yurtrus is the ore god of death and disease. He is a hor-
rifying abomination covered in rot and infection, except 
for his perfect, smooth white hands. 
Ore priests that oversee the line between life and 
death are known by the others in the tribe as hands of 
Yurtrus. They dwell on the fringes of an ore lair, usually 
communing with other ores through the auspices of 
those who follow Luthic. The hands of Yurtrus wear 
pale gloves made of the bleached skin of other human-
oids (preferably elves), symbolizing their connection 
with Yurtrus, and are sometimes called "white hands" 
as a result. 
Every ore knows that the hands ofYurtrus are the 
tribe's gateway to the ancestors. Ores who die having 
served the tribe well go on to rituals meant to send them 
to Gruumsh's realm. 
As befits followers of a god who doesn't speak, hands 
of Yurtrus remove their tongues to emulate their deity, 
for a reason similar to why an eye of Gruumsh puts out 
one of its eyes. 
ORC NURTURED ONE OF YURTRUS 
When plague strikes a tribe, the hands of Yurtrus isolate 
the sick. The priest~ then minister to those who can be 
saved but not healed. The hands cultivate the sickness 
of these nurtured ones, turning them into instruments 
of defense and weapons of war. When ores go to battle, 
a band of nurtured ones might charge in first-to give 
themselves up while softening up the enemy by spread-
ing Yurtrus's vile blessing in its ranks. 
ORC RED FANG OF SHARGAAS 
Shargaas is the ore deity of deep darkness and sneak-
iness, a murderous god who hates anything that lives 
that isn't an ore. Ores consider Shargaas to be a divinity 
suited to pariahs and weaklings, all of them unfit for
