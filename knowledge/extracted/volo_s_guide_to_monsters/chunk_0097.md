Tritons also find the variety of social institutions, 
kingdoms, and other customs bewildering. For all 
their proud culture, they remain innocent of the sur-
face world. The typical triton protectorate is tightly 
regimented, organized, and unified around a common 
cause. A triton on the surface becomes easily confused 
by the bewildering array of alliances, rivalries, and 
petty grievances that prevent the surface folk from 
truly unifying. 
At its worst, a triton's arrogance compounds the ten-
dency for the triton not to understand the ways of the 
surface world. It's easy for a triton to blame baffling 
social practices on what the triton perceives as the bar-
barism, weakness, or cowardice of surface folk. 
TRITON PERSONALITY 
Far from flawless, these champions of good mean well, 
but they are easily frustrated by others. You can select, 
roll, or adapt a triton-specific quirk from the Triton 
Quirks table. Use the quirk to inform how you portray 
your character. 
TRITON QUIRKS 
d6 
Quirk 
You phrase requests as orders that you expect to be 
obeyed.

You are quick to boast of the greatness of your civili-
zation. 
3 
You learned an antiquated version of Common and 
drop ''thee" and "thou" into your speech. 
4 
You assume that people are telling you the truth 
about local customs and expectations. 
5 
The surface world is a wondrous place, and you cata-
log all its details in a journal. 
6 
You mistakenly assume that surface folk know about 
and are impressed by your people's history. 
TRITON NAMES 
Most triton names have two or three syllables. Male 
names typically end with a vowel and the letter s, and 
female names traditionally end with an n. Tritons use 
their home protectorate as a surname, with the name 
formed by adding a vowel followed by a "th" to the end of 
the protectorate's name. 
Female Triton Names: Aryn, Belthyn, Duthyn, Feloren, 
Otanyn, Shalryn, Vlaryn, Wolyn 
Male Triton Names: Corus, Delnis, Jhimas, Keros, Mo-
los, Nalos, Vodos, Zunis 
Triton Surnames: Ahlorsath, Pumanath, Vuuvaxath

Size. Tritons are slightly sli'orter than humans, aver-
aging about 5 feet tall. Your size is Medium. 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you 
have a swimming speed of 30 feet. 
Amphibious. You can breathe air and water. 
Control Air and Water. A child of the sea, you can call 
on the magic of elemental air and water. You can cast 
fog cloud with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can 
cast gust of wind with it, and starting at 5th level, you 
can also cast wall of water with it (see the spell in the 
sidebar). Once you cast a spell with this trait, you can't 
do so again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for these spells. 
Emissary of the Sea. Aquatic beasts have an extraor-
dinary affinity with your people. You can communicate 
simple ideas with beasts that can breathe water. They 
can understand the meaning of your words, though you 
have no special ability to understand them in return. 
Guardians of the Depths. Adapted to even the most 
extreme ocean depths, you have resistance to cold dam-
age, and you ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a 
deep, underwater environment. 
Lan;uages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and Primordial. 
MONSTROUS ADVENTURERS 
In some campaigns, humanoids normally regarded 
as sinister threats can emerge to adventure alongside 
humans and the other standard races. This section is 
aimed at DMs who wish to expand the race selections 
for their campaigns beyond the typical folk of D&D. 
WHY A MONSTROUS CHARACTER? 
Creating characters as creatures normally cast as vil-
lains offers up some interesting roleplaying possibilities. 
Whether played for comedy, as a tragic story of betrayal 
and loss, or as an antihero, a monstrous character gives 
a player a chance to take on an unusual challenge in 
the campaign. Before allowing monstrous characters in 
your campaign, consider the following three questions. 
RARE OR MUNDANE? 
Consider how common ore, goblin, and similar ad-
venturers are in your setting. Are they regarded as 
no stranger than elves or dwarves? Are they met with 
suspicion? The role these races play in your setting 
should determine the kinds of reactions that such char-
acters meet. 
Don't be afraid to push things to an extreme. An ore 
character might have to venture into town in disguise 
or remain in the wilderness, for fear of imprisonment 
or mob violence. Be sure to talk to the group about how 
such characters can expect the world to treat them. 
Some players like the challenge of taking on an outcast, 
but don't set up one expectation and deliver another. 
You can establish a monstrous creat\)re as just an-
other culture in your campaign, one that has alliances 
and rivalries with humans, elves, and dwarves. A 
hobgoblin kingdom might serve as a buffer between a 
human kingdom and a blighted region overrun by the 
spawn of Kyuss. Kobolds might be city builders, the ar-
CHAPTER 2 I CHARACTER RACES 
chitects of grand, heavily fortified edifices, which other 
folk dwell in for a price. The cultural notes in chapter 1 
are the standard D&D depiction of these creatures, but 
by no means do they define them for your campaign. 
Use them as a starting point for your own ideas. 
OUTCAST OR AMBASSADOR? 
Consider how a monstrous character's native culture 
views the character. Is the character an outcast, a spy, 
an ambassador, or something else? Work with the 
player to determine how the character ended up as an 
adventurer. 
The character's bond is a great starting point to con-
sider for this question. How did the bond drive the char-
acter to adventure? The character's trait, flaw, and ideal 
can also play a role in fleshing out the story. 
FRIENDS OR ENEMIES? 
Figure out what special ties the character has to other 
members of the adventuring party. An ore warlock 
might be the dwarf ranger's sworn enemy, but the two 
are forced to work together to defeat a mutual foe. Per-
haps the kobold sorcerer was the tiefling wizard's famil-
iar, transformed by an irate archmage in return for some 
petty insult. The hobgoblin paladin might have been 
human once, but crossed the wrong hag and was cursed 
to take on an evil guise. A creative tie betw,een a mon-
strous character and the rest of the party helps make for 
a memorable campaign. 
The Monstrous Origin table gives a number of ideas 
for adding a monstrous character to the campaign. 
MONSTROUS ORIGIN 
d8 
Origin 
You are a spy sent to undermine your enemies from 
withi11. 
2 
You are the victim of a curse or polymorph spell. 
3

have adopted their culture. 
4 
At a young age, you adopted a human religion and 
now serve it faithfully. 
S 
You received divine insight that sent you on your path, 
and occasionally receive new visions that guide yoq, 
6 
Your sworn enemy is an ally of your people, forcing 
you to leave your tribe to gain vengeance. 
7 
An evil entity corrupted your people's society. 
8 
An injury or strange event caused you to lose all mem-
ory of your past, but occasional flashes of it return to 
you. 
RACIAL TRAITS 
The game traits of the monstrous races are given here. 
Refer to chapter 1 for their cultural and roleplaying 
notes. Some of these races are unusual in that they have 
a reduction to an ability score, and some are more or 
less powerful than the typical D&D races-additional 
reasons for the monstrous races to be used in a cam-
paign with care.
