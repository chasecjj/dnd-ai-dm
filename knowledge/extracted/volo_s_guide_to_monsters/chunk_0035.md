Virtually any kind of creature that can be browbeaten 
into service might be found with a goblin tribe, but rats 
and wolves are nearly always present. Both have lived 
in concert with goblins for at least as long as humans 
have worked with dogs and horses, and in goblin society 
those two animals serve similar purposes. 
FAMILY MATTERS 
A goblin tribe is organized in a four-tiered caste system 
made up of lashers, hunters, gatherers, and pariahs. The 
status of every family in the tribe is based on its impor-
tance to the tribe's survival. Families that belong to the 
higher-ranking castes keep their status by not sharing 
their knowledge and skills with other families, while 
those in the lower castes have little hope of escaping 
their plight. 
Outsiders who don't understand the goblins' social 
system are sometimes surprised by how different castes 
interact with them. A single human warrior might 
frighten away a dozen gatherers, only to be shocked 
when two hunters viciously attack. A captured group 
of invaders might hang in a net while dozens of goblins 
pass by and pay them no heed until a group of gather-
ers shows up. 
Lashers. The closest thing a goblin tribe has to nobil-
ity is the caste of lashers-families of goblins trained in 
the ways of battle, and also possessed of key skills such 
as strategy, trap-building, beast taming, mining, smelt-
ing, forging, and religion. If the tribe has any spellcast-
ers, this caste includes them. Lashers follow the lead of 
the tribe's boss, and enforce their will on other goblins 
with whips. 
Hunters. The families of goblins that are skilled in the 
use of weapons but not privy to any other special knowl-
edge have the second highest status in the tribe. Hunt-
ers are often the best wolf riders and know the most 
about the territory farthest from the tribe's lair. These 
individuals hunt game in peaceful times, and in combat 
they serve as scouts, foot soldiers, and cavalry. 
Gatherers. Families in the second lowest caste are 
responsible for getting food from the surrounding area, 
taking what's naturally available or stealing whatever 
they can. Gatherers also do the little amount of farm-
ing of which goblins are capable and are charged with 
checking traps for captured people or beasts. Gatherers 
aren't usually armed with weapons more deadly than a 
sling or a knife, but they frequently carry nets, caltrops, 
lassos, and nooses on poles for controlling captured 
creatures. These goblins cook for the tribe, and in times 
of war they are also responsible for making poison. 
Gatherers, and the pariahs beneath them, greatly fear 
for their lives in battle, believing that the lashers and the 
hunters have special knowledge of how to survive. It is 
the members of the lower castes that give goblins their 
reputation for cowardice. 
Pariahs. Some goblin families are the lowest of the 
low, composed of the most dimwitted, least educated, 
and weakest goblins. They get the worst jobs: mucking 
out animal pens, cleaning up after other goblins, and do-
ing any hard labor such as digging mines. If the goblin 
tribe has slaves to do some of this work, the pariah fam-
ilies enjoy the opportunity to supervise and dominate 
such creatures, which have no status at all.
