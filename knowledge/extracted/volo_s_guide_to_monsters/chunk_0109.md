CHITINES 
Chitines are multiarmed humanoids 
with arachnid qualities that serve 
Lolth. They operate in well-organized 
colonies that prove to be effective 
fighters in the war against the enemies 
of the Demon Queen of Spiders. On 
occasion, Lolth pits chitines against dark 
elves-even though both groups worship 
her-as a way of punishing the drow, who 
created the chitines but displeased their god-
dess by doing so. 
Unnatural Orisin. Long ago, the drow first 
subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that 
transformed the captives into creatures with both hu-
manoid and spider traits, which their creators dubbed 
chitines. The dark elves' intention was to create slaves 
dedicated first of all to the drow and, by association with 
them, to Lolth. As the drow ultimately discovered, the 
goddess found this arrangement unacceptable. 
The creation process required cooperation between 
magical disciplines. Drow wizards and warlocks used 
arcane magic and demonic powers, and drow priest-
esses invoked Lolth's aid for the divine spark needed to 
ensure the subject's survival. Lolth watched, expecting 
at some part of the process to see these new abomina-
tions dedicated to her, but no such ritu,al was performed. 
In retribution for this lack of respect, the Spider Queen 
twisted the drow's creation rituals to serve her own 
purposes. 
Lolth's Revenge.As the drow continued to perform 
the rituals, the process usually transformed the subject 
into the spindly, stunted creature they expected. Occa-
sionally, though, the elf changed into a monstrosity that 
was more spider than elf, resembling Lolth in her spider 
form, and more cunning than a chitine, that the drow 
dubbed a choldrith. 
At first, the drow were unaware that the new crea-
tures were signs of Lolth's displeasure with them. 
Instead, they were pleased, because choldriths could 
lay eggs that birthed more chitines (and the rare chol-
drith) and could direct the chi tines in their work. But 
the dark elves came to realize their mistake- choldriths 
belonged to Lolth, body and soul. They whispered to 
the chitines of their adoration of the Spider Queen and 
their enmity of the drow, and the seeds of a rebellion 
took root and grew. The chitines and choldriths rose up 
against their would-be masters; soon afterward most of 
the creatures were free, and a number of the drow who 
helped breed and tend them were dead. 
Nowadays, drow still create chitines when they have 
need to. Outside the presence of a choldrith, chitines 
make good workers for the drow, and they can be useful 
if the drow find an independent chitine colony and want 
to infiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, 
though, the drow destroy the creature immediately. 
Lolth's Chosen. Choldriths are born with a fanat-
ical devotion to Lolth, which leads them to develop 
some skill in divine magic. They preach that chitines 
are Lolth's favored people, and that choldriths are the 
Spider Queen's rightful worldly representatives sent to
