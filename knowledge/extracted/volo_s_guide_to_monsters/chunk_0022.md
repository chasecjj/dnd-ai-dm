0RDNING OF MIGHT 
Position within the frost giant ordning is determined by 
sheer, brute strength. Frost giants know that those that 
use cunning, agility, and magic are dangerous foes and 
can sometimes overcome pure strength, but never in a 
straightforward, fair manner: enemies that act that way 
are maug, and strength alone is maat. 
Doubt or disagreement between frost giants over 
which is strongest is settled by a trial of strength. 
Such a contest typically involves wrestling but can 
also be a rock-throwing competition, a hunt, or one-on-
one combat. 
To show proof of their superiority, frost giants keep 
and display trophies of their victims. Mammoth tusks, 
griffon beaks, and manticore tails adorn the walls of 
frost giant lairs. Formidable humanoid enemies are 
memorialized in trophies, too, but only rarely do giants 
put the heads or bodies on display. A human hero's 
greatsword or a wizard's staff is a more appropriate tro-
phy in such cases. 
A frost giant's armor and weapons are as much a 
record of its battle honors as its trophy collection is, for 
those who know how to read the signs. Notches carved 
into the haft of a weapon show the number and type of 
foes it has brought down. Horns, feathers, claws, and 
tusks affixed to helmets and armor serve as decorations 
commemorating the giant's greatest feats of strength. 
The ordning is determined by strength and strength 
alone, and there is no difference in physical prowess 
between the genders of frost giants. (Most child-rearing 
duties are handled by the elderly of both sexes, not 
solely by females.) It is considered highly maug to at-
tack or challenge a pregnant female, even to improve 
one's standing, just as it would be to attack a frost giant 
as it slept. 
A frost giant that is innately weaker than its kin has 
a low rank in the ordning and practically no chance 
of rising any higher. At times, when a giant becomes 
intensely frustrated with that situation, it turns to clan-
destine worship of Vaprak, the deity of trolls and ogres. 
An individual touched by Vaprak's favor is transformed 
into an everlasting one-a giant with enough strength to 
rival the leaders of the clan, but destined to be cast out 
or destroyed if its secret allegiance becomes known. 
Because strength is their only standard of measure-
ment, frost giants are more likely than other giants to 
welcome a non-giant into their group. The might of a 
human who hunts polar bears bare-handed as frost gi-
ants do, or who wrestles a frost giant into submission, 
can't be denied. Such a human could never become the 
chieftain of a tribe but could earn a place of honor as 
one blessed by Thrym. 
RUTHLESS RAIDERS 
Frost giant society has no industry to speak of. It takes 
what it needs from others, and if it can't take some-
thing, it has no need for it. Frost giants do make leather, 
clothes, and bone tools and adornments from the ani-
mals they hunt, but those activities account for almost 
all of their craftwork.
