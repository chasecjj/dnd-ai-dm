Innate Spellcasting. The nilbog's innate spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following 
spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: mage hand, Tasha's hideous laughter, vicious mockery 
1/day: confusion 
Nilbogism. Any creature that attempts to damage the nilbog 
must first succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be 
charmed until the end of the creature's next turn. A creature 
charmed in this way must use its action praising the nilbog. 
The nil bog can't regain hit points, including through magical 
healing, except through its Reversal of Fortune reaction. 
Nimble Escape. The nilbog can take the Disengage or Hide ac-
tion as a bonus action on each of its turns.

one target. Hit: 5 (ld6 + 2) piercing damage. 
REACTIONS 
Reversal of Fortune. In response to another creature dealing 
damage to the nilbog, the nilbog reduces the damage to O and 
regains ld6 hit points. 
NILBOG 
When Maglubiyet conquered the goblin gods, he in-
tended to leave only Khurgorbaeyag alive as a harsh 
overseer who would keep the goblins under heel. But the 
goblins' pantheon included a trickster deity who was de-
termined to get the last laugh. Although its essence was 
shattered by Maglubiyet, this trickster god survives in 
splintered form as a possessing spirit that arises when 
goblinoids form a host, causing disorder in the ranks un-
less it is appeased. Goblins have no name for this deity 
and dare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name to 
ensnare and crush it as he did their other deities. They 
call the possessing spirit, and the goblin possessed by 
it, a nilbog ("goblin" spelled backward), and they revel in 
the fear that a nilbog sows among the ranks of the bug-
bears and hobgoblins in the host. 
Goblins' Revenge. When goblinoids form a host, there 
is a chance that a goblin will become possessed by a 
nil bog, particularly if the goblin has been mistreated by 
its betters. This possession turns the goblin into a wise-
cracking, impish creature fearless of reprisal. It gives 
the goblin strange powers that drive others to do the op-
posite of what they desire. Attacking a goblin possessed 
by a nilbog is foolhardy, and killing the creature just 
prompts the spirit to possess another goblin. The only 
way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat it 
well and give it respect and praise. 
No joking Matter. The possible presence of a nilbog 
in a host has given rise to a practice among goblinoids 
that each host include at least one goblin jester. This 
jester is allowed to go anywhere and do whatever it 
pleases. The position of jester is a much sought-after 
one among the goblins, because even if the jester is obvi-
ously not a nilbog, hobgoblins and bugbears indulge its 
manic behavior. 
NILBOCilSM 
A nil bog is an invisible spirit that possesses only goblins. 
Bereft of a host, the spirit has a flying speed of 30 feet and 
can't speak or be attacked. The only action it can take is to 
attempt to possess a goblin within 5 feet of it. 
A goblin targeted by the spirit must succeed on a DC 
15 Charisma saving throw or become possessed. While 
possessed by the spirit, the goblin's alignment becomes 
chaotic evil, its Charisma becomes 15 (unless it was al-
ready higher), and it gains the nilbog's Innate Spellcasting 
and Nilbogism traits, as well as its Reversal of Fortune 
reaction. If the save succeeds, the spirit can't possess that 
goblin for 24 hours. If its host is killed or the possession is 
ended by a spell such as hallow, magic circle, or protection 
from evil and good, the spirit searches for another goblin 
to possess. The spirit can leave its host at any time, but 
it won't do so willingly unless it knows there's another 
potential host nearby. A goblin stripped of its nil bog spirit 
reverts to its normal statistics and loses the traits it gained 
while possessed.
