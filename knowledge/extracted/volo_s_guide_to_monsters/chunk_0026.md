of stone giants, so their clothing tends to be simple and 
practical. Second, these giants are the least accom-
plished members of the clan. They are good at ambush-
ing and throwing rocks, but they aren't leaders or even 
typical examples of their kind. 
Even if the giants accept the offered tribute as permis-
sion to enter their territory, they might demand a higher 
price to pass through it. Usually this "gift" is a service 
of some kind-a task the giants would rather not do or 
that they're unable to perform, such as chasing kobolds 
out of a narrow cave or retrieving something from deep 
within a lake. (Stone giants are poor swimmers; they 
dislike entering water at all unless they can easily walk 
across the bottom.) 
Stone giants rarely keep pets. They sometimes culti-
vate colonies of giant bats at the edges of their territory, 
both for a food source and as a warning system against 
intruders. They also don't mind sharing their caves or 
warrens with cave bears, fire beetles, and other beasts 
that mean them no harm. They keep their other sub-
terranean neighbors at arm's length. Purple worms 
are their greatest bane, because a hungry worm chews 
through everything it encounters, including the giants' 
finest carvings and sculptures. Xorns are among the 
few creatures that are appreciated by stone giants; 
their passage through the earth causes no damage, and 
their alien modes of thought make them interesting to 
talk with. 
LIFE IN THE DARK 
Stone giants see well in darkness, and the caves and 
grottoes where they live are kept dark most of the time. 
They don't prefer. to use illumination for any purpose 
that's not related to creating or displaying art. 
Most of a giant's waking hours are taken up with 
meeting its responsibilities, whether that is a low-rank-
ing pursuit or an artistic one. A tribe's chieftain or 
another leader such as a shaman determines when 
the tribe's guards and hunters are on or off duty. Other 
giants align their sleeping and waking schedules with 
stone giants higher in the ordning from whom they 
seek to learn. 
Masters of the arts can ask much of lower-ranking 
students, including waking early to be sure the master 
has food upon rising, or staying awake while the master 
sleeps to create something the master will need (or will 
judge) upon waking. For one reason or another, about 
three quarters of a tribe's members are awake at any 
given time. 
When outside their settlements, stone giants travel al-
most exclusively in darkness or-when they dare to visit 
the surface world-at night, the better to avoid the glar-
ing dreams and visions that would assail them during 
daylight. A stone giant that visits the surface for too long 
or is forced out from underground risks becoming lost 
in the realm of dreams, living ever after as a twisted ver-
sion of its former self that the giants call a dreamwalker 
(see chapter 3 for more information on this creature). 
THELINJENSTEIN 
When a stone giant reaches the end of its tremendously 
long life, it joins the Linjenstein ("ancestors of stone"). 
The term refers both to the giants' forebears and to 
the chamber inside each stone giant settlement where 
they "reside." 
A dead (or sometimes merely dying) stone giant is 
carried into the ancestors' chamber and leaned up-
right against the end of one of the rows of dead already 
there. The body gradually calcifies over many decades, 
until it becomes indistinguishable from an enormous 
stalagmite. 
Family members visit this tomb-chamber often to pay 
respects to their ancestors. Some of these visits, espe-
cially by elderly giants who know they will soon take 
their place there, last for weeks or even months. 
STORM GIANTS 
Storm giants, the most powerful and majestic of 
giant-kind, are also the most aloof and the least under-
stood. Uvarjotens aren't just forces of nature; they are 
bound to nature, and are extensions of it, in mystical 
ways that humans find hard to comprehend. 
0RDNING OF OMENS 
Each storm giant knows its status in the ordning by the 
signals the universe sends them. Omens might be seen 
in the wheeling flight of a flock of birds, the patterns in 
sand left by a receding tide, the shapes of clouds, or any 
number of other natural phenomena. Storm giants that 
receive the greatest number of such messages generally 
rank highest, but the significance of individual signs 
can also affect one's status. On the rare occasions when 
storm giants meet, omens and signs accompany each 
individual, making it plain to all present who ranks 
where. Arguments about ranking within the ordning are 
rare, but all the giants in the group studiously examine 
every sign for evidence that one among them might be 
the greatest yet, since the revelation of that fact would 
herald Annam's return. 
Ever since Ostoria fell and Annam abandoned his 
children., no sole king or emperor has ruled over giant-
kind. According to legend, the arrival of such a leader 
will be presaged by signs and omens in all the elements 
of the world: the sky (air), the sea (water), the conti-
nents (earth), and the underworld (fire). All of these are 
Mooos OF STRONMAUS 
Storm giants pay homage to Stronmaus, the eldest of An-
nam's children, who is also the most joyful and the most 
prone to laughter and enjoying fellowship with his siblings. 
That image of Stronmaus is in sharp contrast to how 
storm giants are perceived in the world: aloof and dour. 
Nonetheless, it is an accurate one. 
In the giants' legends, Stronmaus is subject to gray 
moods and deep brooding that are just as intense as his 
moments of good humor. It is also true that storm giants 
aren't as humorless as popular notions paint them to be. 
They're quiet and reserved when they're by themselves, 
which is how they spend most of their time. But when they 
get together with others of their kind, they enjoy mirth, 
song, and drink as much as Stronmaus does. For the sake 
of their privacy and for the safety of smaller beings in the 
vicinity, these rare gatherings occur far from the presence 
of other creatures, thus perpetuating the giants' reputation 
for always being gloomy and grim.
