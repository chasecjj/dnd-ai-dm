THE GIANT TONGUE 
The language that giants share is one of the few rem-
nants from their once-grand empire. Over time it has 
fragmented into many dialects, and each type has its 
own distinctive accent, but giants of different types can 
generally understand one another. 
Any non-giant who learns the Giant language can 
converse with all types of giants, but giants sometimes 
have a hard time hearing the tiny voices of human-sized 
creatures, and some vowel sounds emitted by giants 
are nearly impossible to reproduce for any creature that 
doesn't have lungs as large as beer barrels. 
MAAT AND MAUG 
Two words have special significance in the Giant lan-
guage and the giants' worldview. Neither one of them 
translates directly into Common or any other language, 
because their definitions encompass several related con-
cepts. Maat (pronounced mott) is the term giants use to 
describe ideas, behaviors, creatures, and objects that 
they consider good, holy, honorable, or desirable. Maug 
(pronounced mog) is the counterpart term, embodying 
what other languages call evil, unholy, dishonorable, or 
undesirable. 
Individual giants aren't necessarily thought of as 
maat or maug by their kin. What matters isn't a giant's 
personal philosophy but its standing within the ordning, 
which is influenced by behavior and attitude but also by 
a host of other factors. Every individual commits both 
maat and maug acts, and rises or falls in the ordning as 
a consequence. A giant isn't judged by other giants on 
the basis of whether what it did was inherently good or 
evil, but on whether its actions enhanced or diminished 
the qualities giants admire-the "giantness," if you 
will-in themselves and their clans. 
A storm giant, for example, might see the raiding prac-
tices of hill giants as distasteful but not maug, because 
brutal raiding is an inborn trait of the hill giants. If those 
same hill giants worshiped Yeenoghu, however, that act 
would represent a flagrant turning away from the tra-
ditions of the ordning. Hill giants who choose that path 
make themselves maug. 
Non-giants are considered maug out of hand and must 
usually prove themselves maat to gain a giant's respect. 
RUNES AND TALE CARVINGS 
For much of their written communication, giants use 
a modified version of the runic letterforms claimed by 
the dwarves as their own. This alphabet is used widely 
today, including by many traditional enemies of the 
dwarves such as ores, giants, and goblinoids. That gi-
ants were first in the world and thus the creators of the 
script is a fact that giants take for granted but which 
dwarves hotly dispute. 
Many giants are illiterate or nearly so- particularly 
hill, frost, and fire giants, which place little value on 
learning. Instead of writing stories with words, they 
typically tell their tales with pictograms etched in wood, 
ice, stone, or even earth, in the case of hill giants. These 
"tale carvings" relate legends or the stories of important 
events or meetings in the manner of highly sophisticated 
cave paintings. Often they employ aspects of legends

REPRESENTATIVE GIANT PHRASES 
What is your tribe and rank? Wo dun stomm rad? 
Who is your leader? Wer dun forer? 
I give you respect. Am du paart.

Attack our enemies! Anfel su uvenir!
Lead me to your king. Fang meg zo dun kong. 
about the giant pantheon. For example, Memnor's face 
or head floating above the shoulders of another giant 
indicates that the giant was a liar or a deceiver; a depic-
tion of lallanis being stabbed in the back represents the 
betrayal of love. Such symbols and visual allegories are 
well understood by giants, but they can be indecipher-
able to viewers who aren't steeped in the giants' mythol-
ogy. Most non-giants find a tale carving as unintelligible 
as giants would find poetry written in Elvish.

Giants have a paradoxical relationship with magic. The 
most outwardly magical are the cloud giants, followed 
closely by storm giants. Both types have an innate ability 
to use some forms of magic related to air, weather, and 
gravity. Very few giants, however, study magic in the way 
that humans, dwarves, and elves do. Arcane scholarship 
by itself isn't acknowledged by the ordning; it isn't maug, 
but it isn't maat, either. Mastering the secrets of magic, 
though, demands a degree of devotion that would take 
giants away from pursuits that are valued by the ord-
ning. As a consequence, it's a path rarely taken. 
The exception is rune magic. Giants are drawn to the 
solidity and permanence of magical runes. Stone giants 
are great practitioners of rune carving, both because of
