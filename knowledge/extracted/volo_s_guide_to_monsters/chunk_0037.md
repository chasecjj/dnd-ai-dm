NILBOCiS: PRANKSTERS WITH POWER 
A nilbog ("goblin" spelled backward) is a goblin possessed 
by the spirit of a mischievous prankster god. Even though 
goblins dwell at the bottom of the hierarchy in a goblinoid 
host, the threat of a nilbog appearing in their ranks keeps 
the bugbears and hobgoblins from inflicting too much cru-
elty upon their lessers. 
A nilbog doesn't use its abilities indiscriminately. One 
can be placated if it is provided with comfortable quarters, 
good food, and free rein to do as it wishes, in which case it 
holds its power at bay. 
Hobgoblins have learned how to guard against the ap-
pearance of a nilbog: the crudest, most obnoxious goblin 
in the host is given the title of jester. This goblin lounges in 
a hobgoblin warlord's command center, free to behave as 
it wishes without risk of punishment or rebuke. 
For more information on nilbogs, see chapter 3 of 
this book. 
Booyahg Booyahg Booyahg. This goblin is a sorcerer 
with the wild magic origin whose every casting, includ-
ing cantrips, is accompanied by a wild magic surge. Use 
the mage stat block in the Monster Manual to represent 
this goblin, adding darkvision and the Nimble Escape 
traits common to all goblins. Each time the goblin casts 
a spell, there is an accompanying surge of wild magic; 
roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's Hand-
book to determine the wild magic effect. 
GOBLIN LAIRS 
Tribes of goblins take up residence in shrouded valleys, 
shadowy forests, and caves and tunnels beneath the 
surface of the world. Capable miners and crafters, they 
seek to settle in places where they can get the raw ma-
terials to make weapons and armor. Their need for iron 
and other metals sometimes puts them in conflict with 
other races, but just as often, goblins get what they need 
by claiming mines abandoned by other races and scratch-
ing away at veins thought to be played out. 
When goblins expand a mine, the tunnels they dig 
are narrow and warren-like. Goblins live both within 
these tunnels and on the surface around the outside of 
the area. They guard the territory around the mine for 
miles, sending out patrols of hunters equipped with war 
horns and using wolves as watchdogs to alert them to 
intruders. 
Outskirts. The territory around a goblin lair has sev-
eral hallmarks, most of which aren't readily apparent. 
Packs of wolves allied with the goblins serve as effective 
perimeter guards, without giving away the fact that a 
tribe of goblins lives nearby. Hunters take up guard 
posts in tall trees and atop high rocky outcrops from 
where they can view the terrain while staying unseen. 
Any obvious path through the territory (a valley, a clear 
trail, or a river) might be turned into an ambush point 
where a force of goblins can capture intruders. Such 
places might also be set with net traps, snare traps, or 
hidden pit traps that gatherers regularly check for new 
slaves. The area also includes burial grounds for each 
caste, always placed far from the lair. 
Lair Exterior. Anyone who is skilled or fortunate 
enough to pass through the territory of a goblin tribe 
without being detected is likely to come upon some tell-
• 
tale signs of habitation-complete with goblins at work 
and other goblins standing guard over them. 
If the lair was built around a mine, the tribe's smelting 
furnace and forge will be in the vicinity. A lair inside a 
forest likely has piles of cut timber (and suitable tools) 
nearby. In appropriate terrain, the goblins might set 
aside some land for simple farming (raising mushrooms 
and gourds). If the lair doesn't have enough space under-
ground for everyone, gatherers and pariahs are housed 
in huts on the surface, near the areas where they work. 
Lair Interior. The ideal place for a goblin lair is an 
abandoned mine that features two or three large cham-
bers and a few smaller ones, with tunnels connecting 
them. In such a place, the tribe can protect its most valu-
able assets while providing for a modicum of comfort. 
Most lairs have only a single entrance, but the goblins 
might build a number of escape tunnels that emerge far 
from that location. 
Close inside the entrance, if a suitable area exists, the 
goblins set up a den for their wolves. The animals come 
and go as they please, unless the goblins have use for 
,..,.
