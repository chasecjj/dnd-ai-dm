FIRBOLG NAMES 
Firbolg adopt elven names when they must deal with 
outsiders, although the concept of names strikes them 
as strange. They know the animals and plants of the for-
est without formal names, and instead identify the for-
est's children by their deeds, habits, and other actions. 
By the same token, their tribe names merely refer to 
their homes. When dealing with other races, firbolgs re-
fer to their lands by whatever name the surrounding folk 
use, as a matter of tact and hospitality, but among their 
own kind they simply call it "home." 
Sometimes firbolgs adopt the nicknames or titles out-
siders give them under the assumption that those who 
need names can call them whatever they wish. 
FIRBOLG TRAITS 
Your firbolg character has the following racial traits. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases 
by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1. 
Age. As humanoids related to the fey, firbolg have long 
lifespans. A firbolg reaches adulthood around 30, and 
the oldest of them can live for 500 years. 
Alignment. As people who follow the rhythm of na-
ture and see themselves as its caretakers, firbolg are 
typically neutral good. Evil firbolg are rare and are usu-
ally the sworn enemies of the rest of their kind. 
Size. Firbolg are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh 
between 240 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium. 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Firbolg Magic. You can cast detect magic and disguise 
self with this trait, using Wisdom as your spellcasting 
ability for them. Once you cast either spell, you can't 
cast it again with this trait until you finish a short or 
long rest. When you use this version of disguise self, you 
can seem up to 3 feet shorter than normal, allowing you 
to more easily blend in with humans and elves. 
Hidden Step. As a bonus action, you can magically 
turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until 
you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to 
make a saving throw. Once you use this trait, you can't 
use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 
Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when 
determining your carrying capacity and the weight you 
can push, drag, or lift. 
Speech of Beast and Leaf. You have the ability to 
communicate in a limited manner with beasts and 
plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, 
though you have no special ability to understand them in 
return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you 
make to influence them. 
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, 
Elvish, and Giant. 
FIRBOLG CLASSES 
Most firbolgs are druids, rangers, or fighters. Among 
their kind, these vocations are passed down from one 
generation to the next. The firbolgs' magical heritage also 
expresses itself in other ways; those who become bards 
preserve the clan's lore, and firbolg sorcerers defend their 
communities. Firbolg wizards arise when a clan becomes 
friendly with elves. 
Firbolg rogues are typically scouts tasked with spying on 
neighboring folk to determine their intentions. They are 
most common among firbolgs whose homes border hu-
man settlements. 
Firbolg barbarians are rare except among clans that face 
constant threats from evil humanoids and other invaders. 
Firbolg clerics and paladins are usually dedicated to na-
ture gods and are seen as enforcers of that god's will. 
Firbolg warlocks are rare, but some clans forge alliances 
and arcane pacts with powerful fey beings. 
Firbolg monks are almost entirely unheard of, though a 
monastery might take in the young survivors of a devas-
tated firbolg clan .
