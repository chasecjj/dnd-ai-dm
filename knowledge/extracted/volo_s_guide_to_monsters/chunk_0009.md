PETRIFICATION RAY 
The most mundane function of the petrification ray is 
as a means of decorating a beholder's lair with statues. 
Beyond that, this ray has a multitude of uses. An unruly 
minion could be turned to stone, eliminating the crea-
ture as a threat and creating a permanent reminder of 
the price of disobeying the beholder. A beholder might 
use loosely scattered petrified creatures to create obsta-
cles in an open chamber, or pack them tightly in a cor-
ridor to seal off an area, or use them as falling hazards 
instead of heavy blocks in order to engender fear and 
uncertainty among intruders. 
DISINTEGRATION RAY 
A beholder's disintegration ray is a useful tool for exca-
vation. The beholder can also manipulate the ray with 
pinpoint control, enabling it to cut and shape objects 
as though it were wielding a fine chisel, drill holes too 
small for an arrow to pass through, carve masonry 
blocks out of raw stone, amputate limbs, or brand crea-
tures with burn-like scars. This ray and the telekinetic 
ray are the basis for a beholder's ability to shape its lair 
to its very specific and exacting needs, whether sculpt-
ing rooms or fabricating traps. 
VARIANT ABILITIES 
When a beholder's dream-imagination runs wild, the 
result can be an offspring that has an unusual or unique 
set of abilities. Rather than the standard powers of a be-
holder's central eye and eyestalks, the creature has one 
or more variant abilities-guaranteed to surprise any 
enemies who thought they knew what they were getting 
themselves into. 
This section provides several alternative spell effects 
for a beholder's eye. Each of these effects is designed 
to be of the same power level as the one it replaces, en-
R 1 
MONSTER
OR 
abling you to create a custom beholder without altering 
the monster's challenge rating. As another option, you 
can switch any of the damaging eye rays in the Monster 
Manual to an effect with a different damage type, such 
as replacing the enervation ray with a combustion ray 
that deals fire damage instead of necrotic damage. 
Unless otherwise indicated, an alternative ability 
has the same range as the eye ray it is replacing, and it 
affects only one creature per use (even if the ability is 
based on a spell that normally affects an area or multi-
ple targets) . The saving throw for an alternative ability 
uses the same DC and the same ability score as the 
spell the eye ray is based on.

weakest non-stunned target in the cone each round)
