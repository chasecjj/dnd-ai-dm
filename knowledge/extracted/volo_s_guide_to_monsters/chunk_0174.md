middle ground between two factions, and thus spend a 
lot of energy making sure neither of their allies learn of 
their conflicting connections. Even among yuan-ti, mind 
whisperers are known for being self-important, sneaky, 
and prone to flee at the first sign of trouble. 
This malison is the type that has a human body and a 
snake head. 
YUAN-TI NIGHTMARE SPEAKER 
Nightmare speakers are female yuan-ti malison priests 
that make a pact with the Dendar the Night Serpent to 
feed their deity the fears and nightmares of their victims 
in exchange for power in the mortal worid. The priest-
esses receive nightmarish visions from Dendar, which 
they interpret as prophecies, and then use their magic 
and influence to make these visions come true. 
The cruelest of all yuan-ti, nightmare speakers revel 
in torturing prisoners and slaves, leaving them in a 
constant state of fear and dread. They prefer to terrify 
rather than kill their opponents. They manipulate hu-
manoid communities for the purpose of acquiring more 
victims, and enjoy the company of undead. 
This malison is the type that has a human head and 
upper body with a serpentine lower body instead of legs.
