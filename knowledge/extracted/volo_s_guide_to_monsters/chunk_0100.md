!THIN THIS BESTJARY, YOU WILL FIND 
game statistics and lore for nearly 
one hundred monsters suitable for 
any D&D campaign. Many of these 
monsters, such as the froghemoth 
and the morkoth, have been around 
since the earliest editions of the 
game. Others, such as the bander-
bobb and the vargouille, came later but are equally 
beloved. Some of the new creatures found herein are 
variants of the monsters discussed in chapter 1. 
This chapter is a continuation of the Monster Manual 
and adopts a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar 
with the monster stat block format, read the introduc-
tion of the Monster Manual before proceeding further. It 
explains stat block terminology and gives rules for vari-
ous monster traits-information that isn't repeated here. 
As with the monsters in the Monster Manual, we've 
tried to capture the essence of each creature and focus 
on those traits that make it unique or that encourage 
DMs to use it. You can do what you will with these mon-
sters and change their lore to suit your game. Nothing 
we say here is meant to curtail your creativity. 
The creatures in this bestiary are organized alphabet-
ically. A few are grouped under a banner heading; for 
example, the "Orcs" section contains stat blocks for var-
ious kinds of ores, including tanarukks (demonic ores). 
Immediately following this chapter are two appendices 
that contain additional stat blocks. Appendix A gathers 
a handful of beasts that don't warrant longer entries. Ap-
pendix B provides generic NPCs whose statistics can be 
customized to serve your campaign. 
This chapter and appendices A and B are meant to be 
used in conjunction with the rest of this book. Appendix 
C contains lists of creatures by type, challenge rating, 
and environment. These lists can help you find monsters 
that are appropriate for your adventure or campaign. 
If you're looking for ways to use the variant beholders, 
giants, gnolls, goblinoids, hags, kobolds, mind flayers, 
ores, and yuan-ti described in this chapter, the lore and 
maps in chapter 1 might inspire you. Similarly, the ra-
cial traits in chapter 2 can be applied to the stat blocks 
in appendix B to create such memorable NPCs as goli-
ath champions, kenku master thieves, and tabaxi bards.

B ANDERHOBB 
A banderhobb is a hybrid of shadow and flesh. Through 
dark magic, these components take on an enormous and 
vile humanoid shape, resembling a bipedal toad. In this 
form, a banderhobb temporarily serves its creator as a 
thug, a thief, and a kidnapper. 
Birthed by Hags. In the earliest days of the world, a 
coven of night hags devised a ritual that led to the cre-
ation of the first banderhobb. A hag that knows the ritual 
might be willing to teach it for the right price. Some 
other dark fey and powerful fiends also know of the pro-
cess, as do a few mortal mages. Instructions might also 
be found in a tome devoted to debased wizardry. 
Silent and Deadly. When the ritual to create a bander-
hobb is complete, flesh, spirit, and shadow combine to 
produce a creature as big as an ogre. The newly formed 
monstrosity has spindly limbs that belie great strength. 
Its broad maw holds a long tongue and rows of fangs, 
both of which it uses to grab and swallow a creature or 
perhaps an object the banderhobb intends to steal. De-
spite its size, a banderhobb makes little noise, moving as 
silently as the shadows that infuse it. A banderhobb isn't 
capable of speech, but it can understand orders given to 
it by its creator and communicates with nearby bander-
hobbs in a psychic manner. 
Agentsof Evil. During its brief existence, a bander-
hobb attempts to carry out the bidding of the one who 
birthed it. It accomplishes its mission with no concern 
for the harm it suffers or creates. Its only desire is to 
serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to 
track down a target is particularly dangerous when it 
is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or 
other object connected to the target. Possession of such 
an item allows it to sense the creature's location from as 
far as a mile away. 
A banderhobb fulfills its duties until its existence ends. 
When it expires, usually several days after its birth, it 
leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow. Leg-
ends tell of a dark tower in the Shadowfell where the 
shadows sometimes reform, and banderhobbs roam.

Resonant Connection. If the banderhobb has even a tiny piece 
of a creature or an object in its possession, such as a lock of 
hair or a splinter of wood, it knows the most direct route to that 
creature or object if it is within 1 mile of the banderhobb. 
Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the bander-
hobb can take the Hide action as a bonus action. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 22 (5d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target is grappled 
(escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this 
grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the banderhobb 
can't use its bite attack or tongue attack on another target. 
Tongue. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one crea-
ture. Hit: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the target must make 
a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is 
pulled to a space within 5 feet of the banderhobb, which can 
use a bonus action to make a bite attack against the target. 
Swallow. The banderhobb makes a bite attack against a Me-
dium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the 
creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed 
creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against at-
tacks and other effects outside the banderhobb, and it takes 10 
(3d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the banderhobb's 
turns. A creature reduced to O hit points in this way stops tak-
ing the necrotic damage and becomes stable. 
The banderhobb can have only one creature swallowed at a 
time. While the banderhobb isn't incapacitated, it can regur-
gitate the creature at any time (no action required) in a space 
within 5 feet of it. The creature exits prone. If the banderhobb 
dies, it likewise regurgitates a swallowed creature. 
Shadow Step. The banderhobb magically teleports up to 30 
feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that 
it can see. Before or after teleporting, it can make a bite or 
tongue attack.
