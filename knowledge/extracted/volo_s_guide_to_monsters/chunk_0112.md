DARKLINGS 
Ancient legends speak of a seelie fey who betrayed the 
Summer Queen. His true name has been stricken from 
history, but the stories call him Dubh Catha ("Dark 
Crow" in Common). So great was the Summer Queen's 
wrath that she cursed every member of his house. Other 
fey refer to the descendants of Dubh Catha's house as 
the dubh sith- or, in Common, "darklings." Darklings 
most often settle in secluded caverns and chambers 
beneath the towns of other species. From such enclaves, 
they quietly ply their trade as thieves and assassins. 
The Killing Light. The Summer Queen's curse causes 
a darkling's body to absorb light, and doing so wizens 
the creature, much like the effect of rapid aging. For this 
reason, darklings cover every part of their body with 
clothing when exposure to light is a risk. The light a 
darkling absorbs over the course of its lifetime explodes 
outward when the darkling dies, incinerating the crea-
ture and much of its possessions. 
Love of Art. Despite their curse, darklings retain a 
fondness for the beauty of art. A darkling might risk 
taking a peek at a sunset or lighting a tiny candle to 
glimpse the colors in a painting or a jewel. 
Elder Transformation. A wise and respected darkling 
can qualify to undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other 
elders mark the supplicant with glowing tattoos, chan-
neling some of the darkling's absorbed light away from 
its body. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into 
a tall and fair form, like that of a gray-skinned elf. The 
darkling perishes if the ritual fails.

Death Flash. When the darkling dies, nonmagical light flashes 
out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, 
other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in 
that area and able to see the bright light must succeed on a DC 
10 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the 
creature's next turn. 
Light Sensitivity. While in bright light, the darkling has disad-
vantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks that rely on sight.

Death Burn. When the darkling elder dies, magical light flashes 
out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, 
other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature 
in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On 
a failure, the creature takes 7 (2d6) radiant damage and, if the 
creature can see the light, is blinded until the end of its next 
turn. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half 
the damage and isn't blinded. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The darkling elder makes two melee attacks. 
Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 6 (ld6 + 3) piercing damage. If the darkling elder 
had advantage on the attack roll, the attack deals an extra 10 
(3d6) piercing damage. 
Darkness (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The darkling 
elder casts darkness without any components. Wisdom is its 
spellcasting ability.
