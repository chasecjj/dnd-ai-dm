REDCAP 
A redcap is a homicidal fey creature born of blood lust. 
Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, 
which they use to hunt and kill without hesitation 
or regret. 
Blood Lust Personified. In the Feywild, or 
where that plane touches the world at a fey 
crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an in-
tense desire for bloodshed, one or more red-
caps might appear where the blood of a slain 
person soaks the ground. At first, new red-
caps look like tiny bloodstained mushrooms 
just pushing their caps out of the soil. When 
moonlight shines on one of these caps, a 
creature that looks like a wizened and un-
dersized gnome with a hunched back and 
a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The 
creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of 
similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy 
bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a 
redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets 
out to satisfy these cravings. 
Redcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confronta-
tion and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a red-
cap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take 
ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to 
potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly 
and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the tar-
get can react. 
Steeped in Slaughter. To sustain its unnatural exis-
tence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of 
its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with 
wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn't replen-
ished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes 
as if it had never been. A redcap's desire to slay is rooted 
in its will to survive. 
Bloodthirsty Mercenaries. Redcaps don't usually op-
erate in groups, but in some circumstances they might 
be fond in the employ of hags and dark mages that know 
methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them 
to work as grisly servants. 
Also, some redcaps can sense the being whose mur-
derous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this 
innate connection to find its creator and make that crea-
ture its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy 
proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible 
for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site 
could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emu-
lating that creature's murderous handiwork. 
In any case, if a redcap works with another being, the 
redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who 
tries to stifle a redcap's natural and necessary urge for 
blood risks becoming the redcap's next target.
