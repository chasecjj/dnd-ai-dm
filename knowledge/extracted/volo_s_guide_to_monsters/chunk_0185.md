NECROMANCER 
Necromancers are specialist wizards who study the in-
teraction of life, death, and undeath. Some like to dig up 
corpses to create undead slaves. A few use their powers 
for good, becoming hunters of the undead and risking 
their lives to save others. 
SWASHBUCKLER 
Swashbucklers are charming ne'er-do-wells who live 
by their own codes of honor. They crave notoreity, often 
indulge in romantic trysts, and eke out livings as pirates 
and corsairs, rarely staying in one place for too long.
