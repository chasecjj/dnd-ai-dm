USE TRAPS AND MINIONS 
A beholder in its lair has access to so many resources 
that it can often vanquish invaders without directly con-
fronting them. Devious and hidden traps are liable to 
be lurking around every corner, and might be blatantly 
obvious in some places, yet no less lethal. In similar 
fashion, a beholder might station some of its minions 
in a prime spot for an ambush, or it might send forth a 
bunch of its servants to overrun a group of enemies that 
have been weakened by traps and other hazards. Every 
beholder has minions, and can always acquire more, so 
the master of the lair doesn't hesitate to send its under-
lings into the fray. 
OUTSIDE COMBAT 
As described in the Monster Manual, a beholder's use 
of its eye rays in combat is random, governed by die 
rolls instead of by choice. This rule is an abstraction, 
designed to keep the beholder's opponents unsure of 
what rays will be coming next (and, not incidentally, to 
prevent the monster from using its most lethal eye rays 
at every opportunity). The rule also makes the creature 
easier to run. 
In the safety of its lair, outside the view of any 
would-be enemies, a beholder can use any of its eye rays 
whenever it wants to. Many of them serve as tools. 
ANTIMAGIC CONE 
The magic-nullifying effect of a beholder's central eye 
has a number of possible uses outside combat, but if it's 
not needed, the beholder can turn it off by simply clos-
ing the eye. 
NEGATIVE ENERGY CONE 
Normally usable only by a death tyrant, negative energy 
prevents survivors of a battle from healing and animates 
any dead or dying creatures as zombies under the be-
holder's control. Because there is no limit to the number 
of zombies a death tyrant can animate and control, 
it can pack its lair so full of undead that there is little 
space for anyone to walk, creating a shambling barrier 
of cadaverous resistance against any invasion. 
CHARM RAY 
It is common for a beholder to charm a hostile monster, 
lure the creature to the beholder's lair, and confine it 
there so it can't escape under its own power. In this way, 
even monsters that can't be bribed or coerced can be 
useful to a beholder, making its lair a confusing zoo of 
hostile beasts. 
Although each use of the charm effect lasts only an 
hour, repeated uses over time against the same target 
tend to wear down a creature's will, creating a doc-
ile servant. 
PARALYZING RAY 
Outside combat, the paralyzing ray is most often used 
to restrain a fleeing minion that it doesn't want to de-
stroy outright. 
A beholder always has several backup 
plans ready. When dealing with one, I 
have three plans of my own: run, hide, 
and distract. Rival adventurers are always 
a good distraction. Rival
beholders are 
the best one.

FEAR RAY 
A beholder uses its fear ray to psychologically torture 
and interrogate a prisoner until the creature loses the 
will to resist. 
SLOWING RAY 
A beholder might use its slowing ray on an uncoopera-
tive creature as a demonstration of sorts, threatening to 
follow it up with more severe consequences if the crea-
ture doesn't submit to the beholder's will. 
DEATH RAY AND ENERVATION RAY 
A beholder can fine-tune its death ray or enervation ray 
so that it can "zap" the smallest of targets and deal only 
a small amount of damage {though usually still enough 
to obliterate what it touches). For example, to guard 
against magical spying, a beholder might use either ray 
to eliminate all common vermin (bats, rats, spiders, and 
so on) from its lair. 
TELEKINETIC RAY 
In addition to functioning as the beholder's arms and 
hands for everyday tasks, the telekinetic ray is essential 
for building traps and other lair defenses, such as posi-
tioning the weights for a falling block trap. This ray al-
lows a beholder to station its minions in parts of the lair 
that can otherwise be accessed only by climbing or fly-
ing, preventing the occupants from escaping. A beholder 
could also use its telekinetic ray to forcibly transport a 
creature immune to charm effects (such as a construct 
or some kinds of undead). 
SLEEP RAY 
When it parlays with other creatures, a beholder might 
use its sleep ray as a display of power, quickly disabling 
the leader and thereby persuading the rest of the group 
to mount no resistance. This tactic is useful primarily 
when the beholder intends to use the group for its own 
purposes, and keeping the leader alive is advantageous 
to those plans. This ray is also used to pacify potentially 
useful captives, perhaps in preparation for conditioning 
them with the charm or fear rays.
