STRUCTURED SOCIETY 
The goal of every yuan-ti is to transform itself into the 
ideal combination of snake and humanoid. This attitude 
is reflected in yuan-ti society by a caste system, with sta-
tus predicated on where a particular form of yuan-ti lies 
along the ladder of transformation. 
The basic form of yuan-ti society is a pyramid with 
abominations at the top, malisons in the middle level, 
and purebloods at the base. The outliers are the anath-
emas, the most powerful yuan-ti of all, and two castes 
that lie beneath all yuan-ti: broodguards and slaves. 
Statistics for yuan-ti anathemas, yuan-ti broodguards, 
and new kinds of yuan-ti malisons appear in chapter 3. 
Two new malison variants are presented in the "Yuan-ti 
Malison Variants: Types 4 and 5" sidebar in this chapter. 
YUAN-TI ANATHEMAS 
The exceedingly rare yuan-ti known as anathemas look 
much like abominations, but larger, with clawed hands, 
and six snake heads sprouting from where the head 
should be. Each anathema is the product of a unique 
ritual that alters its original abomination form, increas-
ing its size, power, and intelligence. Other yuan-ti treat 
anathemas like demigods, and they naturally assume a 
leadership position over all others in the area. 
An anathema's aggressive presence brings about a 
transformation in a yuan-ti city, pushing it to become 
more warlike and expansionistic. The anathema directs 
the yuan-ti to wage small-scale wars on humanoids, usu-
ally through proxies such as cults and allied creatures, 
and uses these conflicts to gather riches and slaves until 
it has enough resources to establish the yuan-ti as the 
rulers of a region. 
YUAN-TI ABOMINATIONS 
Mostly ophidian, but with humanlike arms that can 
wield weapons and use tools, abominations closely 
resemble the perfect form that the serpent gods envi-
sioned. Absent the presence of an anathema, yuan-ti 
abominations are the leaders in most yuan-ti cities. 
YUAN-TI MALISONS 
The various kinds of malisons are imperfect compared 
to abominations but still a step above humankind in the 
eyes of the serpent gods. Malisons tend to be receptive 
to religion, seeking insight about how they can improve 
toward the serpent ideal, and many of them become 
leaders in the worship of one of the serpent gods. 
YUAN-TI PUREBLOOD 
The most numerous of the yuan-ti, pure bloods are also 
the most humanlike, exhibiting only one or two snake-
like features such as slitted pupils or patches of scales 
on the skin. 
In yuan-ti cities, pure bloods are treated fairly but live 
m an environment where their wants and needs are 
eclipsed by those of the malisons and abominations. 
Because purebloods can easily pass as human, their 
most important function is as agents of the yuan-ti in the 
outside world. They can live incognito among humans 
as diplomats, infiltrators, and spies. Because they get

to wield power and influence while playing such roles, 
some purebloods surround themselves with luxury in 
their human guises and then become resentful when 
they have to return home and live under the caste 
system again. 
YUAN-TIBROODGUARDS 
The devolved creatures known as broodguards are cre-
ated by feeding humanoids a special elixir, which gives 
them scaly skin and a compulsion to follow orders. Be-
cause their minds are crippled by their transformation, 
broodguards are less useful than slaves for many tasks, 
but because of their unwavering loyalty they make capa-
ble guardians for yuan-ti eggs. 
Broodguards are technically slaves, but because of 
their loyalty and the expense of the potion that creates 
them, they have slightly higher status than common 
slaves-meaning that a pureblood is more likely to give 
a suicidal order to a slave than to a broodguard. 
SLAVES 
Every yuan-ti settlement has a number of other crea-
tures under its control, including intelligent humanoids, 
charmed or trained beasts, and even undead or conjured 
minions. Regardless of their nature, all are treated as 
slaves: no creature that is not a yuan-ti is fit for anything 
other than menial labor and subservience. Slaves that 
fail to follow orders or lag in their duties are dispatched 
or turned into broodguards. 
EMOTIONLESS EVIL 
During their ascension ages ago, the yuan-ti freed them-
selves from the yoke of their human emotions. Now 
they view the world from a pragmatic and dispassionate 
perspective. They understand emotional connections in 
a detached, intellectual way, and recognize that these 
feelings in others can be exploited through bribes, fa-
vors, or threats. 
As creatures devoid of emotion, yuan-ti exhibit behav-
ior and use tactics that exemplify that outlook (or lack 
of one). Whether in combat or in daily life, the following 
principles guide the yuan-ti in all they do.
