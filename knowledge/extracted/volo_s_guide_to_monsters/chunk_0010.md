BEHOLDER LAIRS 
The lair of a beholder is a reflection of the creature's 
mind-set- designed to anticipate, and thwart, any plan 
that would-be invaders might devise. Each of its cham-
bers is isolated, accessible from only one or two other 
areas, giving the beholder control over the route that en-
emies must take to reach the sanctum where the owner 
of the place lies in wait. 
A beholder usually creates its lair in an area of natural 
caves, shaping the chambers with its disintegration ray. 
Most of the entryways and passages that it fashions to 
connect one chamber with another are too narrow to 
admit creatures larger than itself (particularly in the 
innermost chambers). If any large openings between 
adjacent caves exist naturally, the beholder constricts or 
seals off such openings, either by employing slave labor 
or by collapsing the tunnel itself. 
Regardless of its overall configuration, every behold-
er's lair is oriented to take full advantage of the crea-
ture's flight ability. Adjoining chambers are connected 
by vertical or steeply sloped tunnels that the beholder 
carves out of the surrounding stone, each passage 
barely large enough to admit the beholder's body. Ene-
mies that are too big to traverse these smooth-walled 
tunnels will find it difficult to move deep into the lair 
and virtually impossible to confront the beholder in 
its sanctum. 
Minions and other creatures under a beholder's con-
trol generally have their own living spaces in the lair. 
Because a beholder's minions are typically not able to 
fly, many of these chambers are connected to others by 
staircases or gently sloping ramps in addition to the tun-
nels, so the beholder can easily move its minions around 
as the need arises. 
Common rooms found in a beholder's lair are de-
scribed in the sections that follow. 
CENTRAL GALLERY 
The main living area that the beholder uses is filled 
with objects that the creature enjoys looking at, such as 
art, statues, and its latest spoils of victory. The floor is 
uneven and difficult for intruders to navigate. Minions 
usually guard the entrances to this chamber. 
ESCAPE TuNNELS 
A lair has several escape tunnels, each closed off inside 
the lair by a large boulder or a mortared stone wall. 
Most of these routes are blocked on both ends, prevent-
ing creatures from easily entering the lair through any-
where but the main entrance. The beholder, of course, 
can disintegrate these barriers to gain access to the 
tunnel. As with the tunnels between chambers, escape 
tunnels are usually a steep climb or nearly vertical to 
make it difficult for non-flying creatures to follow. A tun-
nel bends every 50 to 100 feet to prevent attackers from 
shooting at the beholder while it flees, but giving the 
monster opportunities to attack when its enemies come 
into view. Many escape tunnels have falling block traps 
or weak ceilings supported by a single pillar, which the 
beholder can disintegrate after it passes that point to 
deter pursuit. 
EYES IN THE SKY 
Because a beholder's paranoia knows no limits, it often 
designs its lair to include secret passageways that are 
used for reconnaissance or surprise attacks. (These fea-
tures aren't shown on the accompanying map, but can 
be located anywhere you see fit.) A typical arrangement 
is a network of tunnels running above the main cham-
bers of the lair, each wide enough for the beholder to fly 
through. Fist-sized holes in the floors of these tunnels 
open into the rooms below, allowing the beholder to spy 
on creatures in its lair and perhaps target them with eye 
rays. (Opponents can shoot back, but the holes function 
like arrow slits and provide three-quarters cover to the 
beholder.) 
MINION CHAMBERS 
The lair has rooms set aside for the beholder's minions, 
where those creatures live, cook, eat, and sleep. 
PRISON 
A beholder often sets aside a chamber to hold captives 
that it chooses not to kill. The simplest kind of prison, 
easy enough for a beholder to create, typically consists 
of 20-foot-deep holes disintegrated into the floor, some-
times covered with a wood or metal grating. A prisoner 
is stripped of weapons and magic items, thrown into one 
of the holes, and guarded by minions at all times. 
SANCTUM 
The beholder's private chamber is usually at the highest 
elevation inside the lair and accessible only through a 
long vertical tunnel. Here, the beholder rests and plots. 
The room typically contains a nest of sand or cloth bed-
ding and the beholder's favorite pieces of sculpture. 
VESTIBULE 
Beyond the lair entrance lies the vestibule. Rather than 
being sculpted with tools or eye rays, the entrance and 
the vestibule are left in their natural form to mislead 
intruders who might be expecting an artificially created 
structure. The floor of the vestibule is usually 15 feet or 
more lower than the entrance corridor, and the chamber 
is often inhabited by shriekers, which act as an early 
warning system. 
TRAPS 
A room not dedicated to some other purpose could be 
festooned with a variety of traps. In addition to traps 
that are meant to catch ground-based creatures, a be-
holder creates or positions certain traps so that they're 
effective against flying intruders. 
Practically any kind of trap could be a feature of a be-
holder's lair. A few possibilities are described here. 
Covered Pit. Simple yet effective, a covered pit trap is 
a hole covered with a false floor and perhaps concealed 
by a sprinkling of dirt or gravel. The pit might be empty, 
be filled with mud (causing anything trapped in it to 
eventually drown), or have spikes at the bottom. 
Door Trap. In a seldom-used cavern with a high ceil-
ing, a beholder might erect a wall that doesn't reach the 
ceiling and build a trapped door into it. The beholder 
can fly over the trap, while intruders are forced to deal 
with the door or waste time trying to climb over the
