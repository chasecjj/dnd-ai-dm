perhaps a couple of close relatives. Cloud giants prefer 
not to congregate in great numbers in any one place, 
to avoid drawing too much attention. It's not that they 
fear attack from humanoids or monsters, because few 
creatures other than dragons can challenge them. But if 
more than a few lived in the same place, the size of their 
combined treasure hoard would attract an incessant 
stream of adventurers and other would-be thieves-a 
nuisance on the order of rats in the larder. 
Despite the distances that separate the homes of 
families, cloud giants aren't isolated. Every family or in-
dividual knows where its nearest neighbors are, even if 
the location is hundreds of miles away, and those neigh-
bors know where their nearest neighbors are, and so on 
across the world. In a crisis, word is spread from family 
to family, so that a mighty squad of cloud giants could be 
assembled, in time, if need arises. 
Most cloud giant homes include one or more pets. 
Wyverns, griffons, giant eagles and owls, and other 
beasts of the sky are popular choices. Pets aren't lim-
ited to flying creatures, though. Any sort of creature 
might be found in a cloud giant menagerie, with rare 
specimens treated more as status symbol than as 
companions. 
BENEVOLENT OVERLORDS 
Cloud giants are famous (or infamous) for demanding 
tribute from the humanoids that live beneath them. 
Such tribute is only proper from their perspective, for 
two reasons. First, their presence in an area benefits 
everyone by driving away many evils, especially flying 
predators such as manticores and wyverns. Second, 
the giants believe they deserve to be rewarded for their 
forbearance; no one could stop them from simply taking 
what they want, but instead of doing that they allow their 
tribute to be freely given. (The logic of that position is 
clearer to the giants than it is to those on the other end 
of the arrangement.) 
Much of the tribute that cloud giants accept is in the 
form of livestock and crops, but this isn't their only 
source of food. Cloud giants are avid gardeners. Almost 
all cloud giant strongholds devote space to a garden 
that produces enormous yields: beans as big as turnips, 
turnips as big as pumpkins, and pumpkins as big as 
carriages. 
The garden of a cloud giant family is seldom affected 
by drought, frost, or locusts. When such a calamity 
strikes nearby farms, families have been known to share 
their bounty to ease the humanoids' food shortage. Such 
events are at the root of tales about magic beans and 
others about a human family living in a cottage carved 
from a single, enormous gourd. Beyond that, the cloud 
giants' generosity in times of want helps to cement their 
reputation as friends of humankind-a reputation that 
serves them well, even though it's not entirely deserved. 
0RDNING OF EXTRAVAGANCE 
A cloud giant's position within the ordning doesn't de-
pend on talent or skill. It depends on wealth. The more 
treasure a cloud giant possesses, the higher its stand-
ing. It's as simple as that. Almost. 
Ownership is one thing, but wealth that's kept locked 
away means little. To fully contribute to one's status, 
wealth must be displayed, and the more ostentatious 
the display, the better. In a cloud giant family's home, 
extravagance is omnipresent. One might boast windows
