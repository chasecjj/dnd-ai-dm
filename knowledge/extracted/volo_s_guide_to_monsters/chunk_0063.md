MIND FLAYER BONDS 
d6 
Bond 
I think the elder brain is wrong about something, and 
I want to convince it. 
2 
I have a secret I wish to keep even from other mind 
flayers. 
3 
The more the colony grows, the more powerful we all 
become. 
4 
Nothing is more important than rebuilding our lost 
empire. 
5 
Persistence of my colony is the greatest good. 
6 
I have important research that must be protected at 
all costs. 
MIND FLAYER FLAWS 
d6 
Flaw 
I am oblivious to the emotions expressed by others. 
2 
I believe my minions will always do precisely as I 
intend. 
3 
I never assume others understand and always explain 
everything. 
4 
I have a memory that isn't mine. I'm obsess about it. 
5 
It is inconceivable that another creature could out-
smart me. 
6 
I sometimes confuse others' thoughts with my own. 
MIND FLAYER NAMES 
Among mind flayers, thoughts aren't communicated in 
language per se, but are instead transmitted telepathi-
cally as concepts and associations, which other human-
oids interpret in their own language. 
Telepathic communication with a mind flayer is fre-
quently accompanied by a mental static that "sounds" 
to the receiver like an underlying sussuration peppered 
with guttural clicks. The intensity of this static increases 
when a mind flayer refers to itself, because with the say-
ing of its name, the illithid is communicating far more 
information about itself than other humanoids can com-
prehend. The syllables that make up mind flayer names 
as expressed in other languages are thus weak approx-
imations of the sound that others hear in their minds 
when illithids refer to themselves. 
An illithid might adopt a name that is easier for min-
ions and allies to speak or that makes it seem more fear-
some to enemies, but each begins its life with a thought-
name such as the examples in the Mind Flayer Names 
table, which are suitable for any campaign.

SPEECH 
The physiology of mind flayers doesn't leave them 
well equipped for typical humanoid speech, and most 
use telepathy exclusively. At times, however, they find 
it necessary to speak, such as when casting a divine 
spell, voicing the command word of a magic item, or 
communicating with multiple creatures at once. A mind 
flayer accomplishes such vocal feats by forcing one of its 
tentacles down its own throat and curling the tip to act 
as a tongue. The process is uncomfortable to the mind 
flayer, can be disquieting for other creatures to witness, 
and results in a sound that is often harrowing to the ear. 
Despite the difficulty, some mind flayers make a study of 
spoken communication and manage consistently intelli-
gible (if not melodious) speech. 
UALITH 
The "writing" of mind flayers, known as Qualith, isn't as 
simple as a set of symbols representing sounds or ideas. 
An inscription in Qualith captures the thoughts of its 
creator and psionically transmits the thoughts to a mind 
flayer who later reads the inscription by touching it with 
its tentacles. Mind flayers write in Qualith by psionically 
imprinting their messages on nonmagical, nonliving 
material they grasp or caress with their tentacles. The 
imprinting causes imperceptible surface changes to the 
object, and abrasion or degradation of the material can 
cause the inscription to fade and fail. 
An expression in Qualith is made up of four-line stan-
zas packed into interlocking blocks, creating complex 
patterns that are indecipherable by other creatures. 
Someone that touches a Qualith inscription, however, 
can receive fragmentary insight into the multilayered 
thoughts contained within it. A non-illithid that wants 
to understand a Qualith inscription can make an Intel-
ligence check (DC based on the complexity of the con-
tained thoughts) to try to derive some of the inscription's 
meaning. Multiple successful attempts might uncover 
different aspects about the illithid author, its intended 
meaning, and its intended audience. A failed attempt 
results in a crushing headache and, in extreme cases, 
madness. A comprehend languages spell provides 
understanding of the inscription roughly equivalent to 
what a mind flayer would get from it. 
MIND FLAYER THRALLS 
Mind flayers never truly ally with any creatures. They 
either attempt to seize control of a population by sub-
verting its leaders, or they use psionics to dominate a 
humanoid and turn it into a thrall. 
Illithids sometimes infiltrate an Underdark tribe of 
humanoids and use their superstitions and traditions as 
tools to make them useful followers. A mind flayer might 
use its psionic ability to send visions to a humanoid sha-
man, causing it to proclaim the mind flayers as emissar-
ies of the gods. With that ruse in place, the "gods" then 
dictate strict rules that cause some members of the tribe 
to be branded as heretics, to provide the pretense for oc-
casionally seizing a humanoid and devouring its brain.
