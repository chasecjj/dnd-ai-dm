to the ordning. Storm giants ruled all from both below 
and above. They held sway over the oceans from under-
sea fortresses and lorded over the land from castles in 
the sky. Cloud giants built immense floating cities and 
served the storm giants as their strong right hands. 
Stone giants and fire giants settled on the mountaintops 
and in the sprawling caverns beneath them, where they 
carved and forged the greatest works of giant art and 
craft. Frost giants defended Ostoria with the might of 
their arms, not just on the chilly peaks and glaciers but 
on every frontier. Hill giants sprawled over all other 
lands, subjugating lesser creatures through brute force. 
BEGINNING OF THE END 
All told, the empire of Ostoria dominated the world for 
four millennia before its decline began in a genocidal 
struggle against the dragons that came to be known as 
the Thousand-Year War. 
Dragons had lived in and around Ostoria in relative 
peace since the empire's foundation. Conflicts between 
dragons and giants in those days were personal, not 
tribal or regional, and usually involved bragging rights 
or hunting territory. Differences were settled by indi-
vidual contests of might, wits, or skill. That situation 
persisted for generations, until the red dragon Garyx 
inflamed the greed and envy in its followers by rail-
ing against the giants' prosperity, and they rose up 
in response. 
At least, that's what most giants believed to have 
happened. No one really knows any longer what set off 
the war. But once battle began, the long-standing peace 
between giants and dragons crumbled everywhere. 
Foes tore at each others' throats in all parts of Ostoria. 
There were no front lines or safe havens, only endless 
ambushes, sieges, and atrocities committed against gi-
ants and dragons alike. Eventually, none were left alive 
on either side who had seen the war's beginning. Age 
and brutality had claimed them all, and the few giants 
and dragons then alive had spent their entire existence 
at war. The Thousand-Year War didn't truly end so much 
as it wasted away through attrition and exhaustion. 
The realm that could still be called Ostoria survived 
only far in the north. A few outposts and fragment king-
doms, such as the fire giants' Helligheim and the stone 
giants' Nedeheim, clung to life in deep caverns and hid-
den valleys. In the millennia that followed, even these 
places fell, and what remained of Ostorian territory 
became barren, shrouded in ice as thick as mountains. 
Since that time, many lesser races have attained great-
ness and themselves fallen into obscurity. Few hints of 
the giants' once-great empire have survived the relent-
less accumulation of years. 
0STORIA AND OTHER WORLDS 
The tale ofOstoria is drawn from the Forgotten Realms. 
Think of itas a good example of how giants developed on 
many worlds, as it captures their rise and fall from prom-
inence in a manner that is iconic to many D&D settings. 
In your own world, you can replace Ostoria with another 
giant empire or adapt it to create your own origin story. 
VONINHEIM, THE LOST CAPITAL 
Voninheim ("Titan Home" in the Giant language) stood as 
the capital ofOstoria for millennia. It was an awe-inspiring 
structure of iron and stone, raised by magic as much as 
by mortal hands. Some attributed its construction directly 
to one or more of Annam's sons, arguing that even giants 
couldn't have erected such a monumental edifice. The pal-
ace stood firm and unshaken as glaciers that could flatten 
mountains assailed it and flowed around it, until only its 
iron spires jutted above the ice like great, gray fangs. Even-
tually the relentless ice buried it utterly, and Voninheim 
was abandoned. Many giants seek to rediscover its loca-
tion: some hope to recapture the lost glory of Ostoria, but 
others want only to claim the mighty weapons of legend 
said to be entombed in its frozen halls. 
But the giants remember. Their empire and their 
unified purpose are long gone, but a yearning for a re-
turn to the greatness that was once theirs burns in all 
their memories. 
ANNAM'S OFFSPRING: THE GIANT PANTHEON 
When Ostoria fell, Annam disowned his children, 
swearing never to regard the giants again until they 
returned Ostoria to its past prominence and reclaimed 
their rightful positions as rulers of the world. Giants, 
therefore, don't pray to Annam, who refuses to hear 
them. Instead, they revere his divine children, as well as 
a host of other hero-deities and godly villains that are 
minor members of the pantheon. 
Chief among the giant gods are the six sons of Annam. 
The brothers are Stronmaus (champion and favorite of 
storm giants), Memnor (cloud giants), Surtur (fire gi-
ants), Thrym (frost giants), Skoraeus Stonebones (stone 
giants), and Grolantor (hill giants). 
Although each of Annam's sons is typically worshiped 
by giants of a particular type, they, like Annam himself, 
aren't racially distinct. Stronmaus, for example, doesn't 
look like a storm giant, though he is often depicted as 
one in carvings and other art. Like Annam and each of 
his brothers, Stronmaus is a unique godly being with no 
mortal equivalent. His temperament and interests are 
similar to those of the storm giants, so most of his fol-
lowers are of that type. 
Similar statements can be made about the other five 
brothers. Most cloud giants revere Memnor, for exam-
ple, but many reject him because of his deceitfulness 
and venerate Stronmaus instead. A storm giant living 
amid blizzards and icebergs in the far northern sea 
might pay homage to Thrym rather than to Stronmaus. 
Giants that have given up hope of rising in the ordning 
sometimes worship Vaprak the Destroyer, who is recog-
nized by giants as the father of trolls and ogres. 
Giants don't worship male deities exclusively, either. 
Annam's mate Othea, Hiatea the huntress and home 
warden, Iallanis the goddess of love and peace, and 
Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster, have 
substantial followings. Like humans, some giants even 
fall prey to demon cults, in which they pay homage to a 
demon lord such as Baphomet or Kostchtchie. Worship-
ing such entities, or any non-giant deity, is considered a 
great sin against the ordning. Being discovered means 
being cast out from family and clan.
