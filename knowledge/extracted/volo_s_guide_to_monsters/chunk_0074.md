0RC NAMES 
Ore names don't always have meaning in the Ore lan-
guage, and most noteworthy ores are given epithets by 
their tribe mates.

The Brutal 
HALF-0RCS 
The lore of humans depicts ores as rapacious fiends, 
intent on coupling with other humanoids to spread their 
seed far and wide. In truth, ores mate with non-ores only 
when they think such a match will strengthen the tribe. 
When ores encounter human who match them in prow-
ess and ferocity, they sometimes strike an alliance that 
is sealed by mingling the bloodlines of the two groups. 
A half-ore in an ore tribe is often just as strong as a 
full-blooded ore and also displays superior cunning. 
Thus, half-ores are capable of gaining status in the tribe 
more quickly than their fellows, and it isn't unusual for a 
half-ore to rise to leadership of a tribe. 
0ROGS 
Ores believe that an orog's exceptional strength and 
intelligence are a gift from the goddess Luthic to ensure 
that her brood survives and flourishes. So, when an 
orog is born, a tremor goes throughout the tribe, for the 
event is seen as a great blessing from the goddess, but it 
brings tension as well. 
An orog within the tribe poses a potential problem for 
an ore war chief: will the orog grow up to be a powerful 
ally or a dangerous adversary? Most war chiefs treasure 
their positions so highly that they would refuse to relin-
quish the title, even to a clearly superior creature. Thus, 
a chief might be tempted to kill the orog while it is still 
young and weak, but such an act would most certainly 
incur the wrath of Luthic. 
To raise an orog within the tribe, from the chiefs 
point of view, is to take a risk that the orog won't one day 
rise up and usurp power from the chief. Because of this 
sentiment, orogs are secreted away by priestesses of 
Luthic and raised out of the sight of the chief. 
KEEPING THE BALANCE 
What most war chiefs don't realize, or trust in, is the fact 
that orogs aren't a direct threat to their rule. By nothing 
more than their presence, orogs serve as a balancing 
force. Indoctrinated by the priestesses of Luthic, they 
see to it that Luthic's followers are protected from the 
more aggressive members of the tribe. Most orogs don't 
go on raids, because their main responsibility is the 
safety of the tribe members that remain in the lair- en-
suring that the tribe remains intact even if a raid goes 
badly and many warriors are killed. In times of internal 
strife, such as after the death of the chief, orogs move 
in to oversee the selection of a new leader and keep the 
tribe from splintering due to infighting. Orogs strive not 
to lead their tribe, but to keep the tribe together- which 
is often the more difficult of the two tasks. 
BREAKING THE MOLD 
An ore lives on the edge of chaos and rage, and orogs 
are no exception. At times, an orog goes rogue and be-
comes a force of destruction in the tribe, seeking to frac-
ture the group along lines of loyalty to the gods. If those 
who worship Luthic and those who worship Gruumsh 
split, the tribe can be torn apart by the schism. 
At the other extreme, an orog might accept a role in 
battle or leadership under special circumstances. If a 
tribe finds itself up against formidable or unexpected re-
sistance, the endurance and superior intellect of an orog 
serving as chief or battle master can be enough to win 
the day when a less capable leader would have failed. 
TANARUKKS 
A tanarukk is an abyssal creation infused with demonic 
power. Half demon, half ore, it wanders the world in a 
murderous haze. Its dimly glowing red eyes burn un-
der thick, horn-like brows, and its tusks and claws are 
razor-sharp. Because the skin of tanarukks is unnatu-
rally tough, they rarely wear armor, preferring to rush 
into battle unencumbered, smashing their foes with a 
demon-forged maul or tearing them apart.
