DINOSAURS 
The Monster Manual has statistics for several kinds of 
dinosaurs. This section provides several more. 
BRONTOSAURUS 
This massive four-legged dinosaur is large enough that 
most predators leave it alone. Its deadly tail can drive 
away or kill smaller threats. 
DEINONYCHUS 
This larger cousin of the velociraptor kills by gripping 
its target with its claws and feeding while the creature is 
still alive. 
DIMETRODON 
This sail-backed reptile is commonly found in areas 
where dinosaurs live. It hunts on shores and in shallow 
water, filling a similar role as a crocodile. 
HADROSAURUS 
A hadrosaurus is a semi-quadrupedal herbivore recog-
nizable by its bony head crests. If raised as a hatchling, 
it can be trained to carry a Small or Medium rider. 
UETZALCOATLUS 
This giant relative of the pteranodon has a wingspan ex-
ceeding 30 feet. Although it can move on the ground like 
a quadruped, it is more comfortable in the air. 
STEGOSAURUS 
This heavily built dinosaur has rows of plates on its back 
and a flexible, spiked tail held high to strike predators. It 
tends to travel in herds of mixed ages. 
V ELOCIRAPTOR 
This feathered dinosaur is about the size of a large tur-
key. It is an aggressive predator and often hunts in packs 
to bring down larger prey.
