Even so, their light weight and size allow them to dwell 
in rickety structures that would collapse beneath a hu-
man or an ore. 
Some thieves' guilds use kenku as lookouts and mes-
sengers. The kenku dwell in the tallest buildings and 
towers the guild controls, allowing them to lurk in the 
highest levels and to keep watch on the city below. 
HOPELESS PLAGIARISTS 
As a result of their lack of creativity, kenku function 
comfortably as minions of a powerful master. Flock 
leaders enforce discipline and minimize conflicts, 
but they fail at effective planning or crafting long-
term schemes. 
Although unable to speak in.their own voices, kenku 
can perfectly mimic any sound they hear, from a half-
ling's voice to the noise of rocks clattering down a hill-
side. However, kenku cannot create new sounds and 
can communicate only by using sounds they have heard. 
Most kenku use a combination of overheard phrases 
and sound effects to convey their ideas and thoughts. 
By the same token, kenku have no ability to invent new 
ideas or create new things. Kenku can copy existing

items with exceptional skill, allowing them to become 
excellent artisans and scribes. They can copy books, 
make replicas of objects, and otherwise thrive in situa-
tions where they can produce large numbers of identical 
items. Few kenku find this work satisfying, since their 
quest for the freedom of flight makes them ill-suited to 
settle into a routine. 
IDEAL MINIONS 
Kenku gather in groups called flocks. A flock is led by 
the oldest and most experienced kenku with the widest 
store of knowledge to draw on, often called Master. 
Although kenku can't create new things, they have a 
talent for learning and memorizing details. Thus, am-
bitious kenku can excel as superb spies and scouts. A 
kenku who learns of clever schemes and plans devised 
by other creatures can put them to use. The kenku lack 
the talent to improvise or alter a plan, but a wise Master 
sets multiple plans in motion at once, confident that un-
derlings can follow orders to the letter. 
For this reason, many kenku make an easy living 
serving as messengers, spies, and lookouts for thieves' 
guilds, bandits, and other criminal cartels. A network of 
kenku can relay a bird call or similar noise across the 
city, alerting their allies to the approach of a guard pa-
trol or signaling a prime opportunity for a robbery. 
Since kenku can precisely reproduce any sound, the 
messages they carry rarely suffer degradation or shifts 
in meaning. Human messengers might switch words 
or phrases and garble a message inadvertently, but the 
kenku produce perfect copies of whatever they hear. 
KENKU ADVENTURERS 
Kenku adventurers are usually the survivors of a flock 
that has sustained heavy losses, or a rare kenku who 
has grown weary of a life of crime. These kenku are 
more ambitious and daring than their fellows. Others 
strike out on their own in search of the secrets of flight, 
to master magic, or to uncover the secret of their curse 
and find a method to break it. 
Kenku adventurers, despite their relative indepen-
dence, still have a tendency to seek out a companion to 
emulate and follow. A kenku loves to mimic the voice 
and words of its chosen companion. 
KENKU NAMES 
Given that kenku can duplicate any sound, their names 
are drawn from a staggering variety of noises and 
phrases. Kenku names tend to break down into three 
categories that make no distinction between male and 
female names. 
Kenku thugs, warriors, and toughs adopt noises made 
by weapons, such as the clang of a mace against armor 
or the sound made by a b_reaking bone. Non-kenku 
refer to the kenku by describing this noise. Examples 
of this type of name include Smasher, Clanger, Slicer, 
and Basher. 
Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal 
noises, typically those common in urban settings. In this 
manner, kenku can call out to each other while those 
who overhear them mistake them for common animals.
