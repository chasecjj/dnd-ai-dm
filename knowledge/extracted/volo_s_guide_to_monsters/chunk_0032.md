band to include cultists-other humanoids that have 
dedicated themselves to Yeenoghu and attached them-
selves to the war band to prove their loyalty. 
Each of these elements of a war band is further de-
scribed below. Statistics for gnoll flesh gnawers, gnoll 
hunters, gnoll witherlings, and flinds appear in chapter 
3 of this book. 
GNOLL PACK LORD 
Most war bands are led by pack lords. These champions 
of Yeenoghu curry their lord's favor with living sacri-
fices. They mark their hides with bloody runes, which 
sometimes grant supernatural power conferred by 
Yeenoghu himself. Pack lords favor big, heavy weapons, 
such as glaives and axes. 
GNOLLFANGSOFYEENOGHU 
Fangs ofYeenoghu are gifted with the power to spawn 
more gnolls. They anoint the remains of their foes us-
ing bizarre rituals. A hyena that feeds on such a corpse 
spawns a gnoll, while other humanoids who join in 
the feast become cultists ofYeenoghu. Fangs use their 
claws in battle, the better to imbue their victims with the 
magic needed to spawn more gnolls. 
GNOLL WARRIORS 
Common gnolls comprise the bulk of a war band. They 
fight mainly with spears fashioned from wood and bone. 
While they lack any particular blessing ofYeenoghu, 
their ferocity makes them formidable enemies. 
GNOLL HUNTERS 
When a war band is on the move, the hunters travel in a 
wide arc around the perimeter of the force. Hunters are 
more adept than other gnolls at sneaking and moving 
through an area undetected, which makes them useful 
for reconnaissance. Sometimes a team of hunters is 
used to silently pick off sentries on patrol before they 
can raise an alarm, which makes the upcoming on-
slaught by the rest of the war band even more lethal. 
Another function that hunters perform is to trail along 
behind a war band, making quick work of wounded 
gnolls and those who can't keep up the pace. 
GNOLL FLESH GNAWERS 
All gnolls are ruthless and brutal, but the flesh gnawers 
in a war band use their quickness and agility to augment 
their savagery. At the start of a raid, flesh gnawers lurk 
around the edges of the gnoll forces, hoping to jump 
on enemies that become isolated. When a flesh gnawer 
springs into action, its blades and teeth turn it into a 
whirling dealer of death, able to dash from one target to 
the next as though it had been shot from a bow. 
GNOLL WITHERLINGS 
A war band might go for weeks without coming across 
the sort of prey it craves. Gnolls can eat wild animals 
for sustenance, but only the flesh of intelligent human-
oids can calm the endless hunger bestowed upon them 
by Yeenoghu. 
When a war band grows desperate for food, its mem-
bers turn on each other. Those who succumb to the 
violence are devoured, but their service to the war band

doesn't end at that point. The survivors preserve the 
bones of their fallen comrades, so that a pack lord or a 
flind can perform a ritual to Yeenoghu to turn them into 
loyal, undead followers known as witherlings. 
Even after death, gnoll witherlings serve the war band 
much as their comrades do. Although not as formida-
ble in battle as warriors or hunters, they are just as 
relentless. 
FLINDS 
A flind is an exceptionally large and strong gnoll. No 
war band contains more than one flind, and such a 
creature is always the leader of its band. A flind wields 
a weapon that carries Yeenoghu's blessing: a magical 
flail that saps the body and the mind of any foe that feels 
its touch. 
Because flinds are so rare, other gnolls see them as 
Yeenoghu's special messengers, gifted with a keen eye 
for omens and an ear for Yeenoghu's whispers. Each 
day, a flind consults the signs around it and determines 
the war band's direction. 
During a battle, a gnoll that delivers the death blow to 
a flind claims its flail and, in a burst of abyssal energy, 
is touched by Yeenoghu and turns into a flind itself. The 
death or disappearance of a flind for any other reason 
causes a war band to descend into brutal infighting. 
Sometimes a new leader emerges from the pack after 
putting down its rivals; more often, the band fragments 
and the survivors go their separate ways. 
CULTISTS 
Rarely, a war band includes ores, humans, or other 
humanoids that have sworn loyalty to Yeenoghu. The 
gnolls treat these cultists as they would other gnolls, 
refraining from killing them so long as they join in the 
slaughter when the band finds prey. 
Almost all cultists are brutish individuals touched 
by insanity, one step above the hyenas that trail behind 
the war band's path. They aren't gnolls, and thus don't 
receive their inspiration directly from Yeenoghu. Yet 
exceptions do occur. If an individual of great intelligence 
and great ability heeds Yeenoghu's call, the Lord of 
Savagery might elevate it to the leadership of its band. 
Such champions are rare, and a band led by a cultist is 
capable of feats that are beyond a group of gnolls- ac-
complishments that combine the gnolls' savagery with a 
humanlike level of intelligence and planning.
