them. Any tunnel in the lair, whether dug by goblins or 
not, is likely to be trapped, typically in a way that not 
only injures the enemy but also collapses the passage. 
Open spaces inside a lair are useful for a number of 
reasons, and the goblins will hollow out chambers for 
their use if need be. Slaves and tamed monsters are best 
kept in large areas with limited access, making them 
easier to guard. The tribe's boss lays claim to a space 
that's treated as a throne room of sorts. The lashers and 
hunters of a tribe occupy other caverns and chambers, 
enjoying the comfort and safety of underground living as 
a reward for their status and their value to the group. 
BUGBEARS 
Bugbears feature in the nightmare tales of many races-
great, hairy beasts that creep through the shadows as 
quiet as cats. If you walk alone in the woods, a bugbear 
will reach out of the bushes and strangle you. If you 
stray too far from the house at night, bugbears will 
scoop you up to devour you in their den. If a bugbear 
cuts off your head, your soul stays trapped inside, and 
the bugbears use your head to magically command all 
whom you once knew. 
Lurid tales such as these have flowered from the 
seeds of truth. Bugbears do rely on stealth and strength 
to attack, preferring to operate at night. They do take the 
heads of enemy leaders, but they are no more likely to 
eat people indiscriminately than humans are. Bugbears 
aren't likely to attack lone travelers or wandering chil-
dren unless they clearly have something to gain by doing 
so. From the viewpoint of the rest of the world, their 
aggression and savagery are thankfully offset by their 
rarity and lethargy. 
SHIFTLESS, SAVAGE LAYABOUTS 
When they're not in battle, bugbears spend much of 
their time resting or dozing. They don't engage in craft-
ing or agriculture to any great extent, or otherwise 
produce anything of value. They bully weaker creatures 
into doing their bidding, so they can take it easy. When a 
superior force tries to intimidate bugbears into service, 
they will try to escape rather than perform the work or 
confront the foe. Even when subsumed into a goblinoid 
host and drawn into war, bugbears must often be roused 
from naps and bribed to get them to do their duties. 
This indolence offers no clue to how vicious the crea-
tures are. Bugbears are capable of bouts of incredible 
ferocity, using their muscular bodies to exact swift and 
ruthless violence. At their core, bugbears are ambush 
predators accustomed to long periods of inactivity bro-
ken by short bursts of murderous energy. Ferocious 
though they may be, bugbears aren't built for extended 
periods of exertion. 
GANG MENTALITY 
Since bugbears aren't a particularly fecund race, their 
overall population is small and spread over a wide area. 
Bugbears live in family groups that operate much like 
gangs. The individuals in a group typically number 
fewer than a dozen, consisting of siblings and their 
mates as well as a handful of offspring and an elder or 
two. A gang lives in and around a small enclosure, often 
a natural cave or an old bear den, and it might have sup-
plementary dens elsewhere in its territory that it uses 
temporarily when it goes on long forays for food. 
In good times, a bugbear gang is tight-knit, and its 
members cooperate well when hunting or bullying other 
creatures. But when the fortunes of a gang turn sour, 
the individuals become selfish, and might sabotage one 
another to remove opposition or exile weaker or unpop-
ular members to keep the rest of the gang strong. For-
tunately for the race as a whole, even young and elderly 
bugbears have the ability to survive alone in the wild, 
and the cast-off members of a gang might eventually 
catch on with a different group. 
Left to their own devices, bugbears have little more 
impact on the world than wolf packs. They subsist by 
crafting simple tools and hunting and gathering food, 
and gangs sometimes come together peacefully to ex-
change members and goods between them. 
MALEVOLENT WORSHIP OF MALIGN GODS 
Bugbears worship two deities who are brothers, Hrug-
gek and Grankhul. Hruggek is the fearsome elder sib-
ling, possessed of legendary might and prowess in bat-
tle. Bugbears believe their strength and bravery come 
from him. Cunning Grankhul is the younger one, and in 
the stories bugbears tell, he gifted them with stealth but 
in return he sapped their vigor, so that bugbears sleep in 
his stead while he remains eternally alert and awake. 
According to bugbear legends, Hruggek and Grankhul 
often fight alongside each other, preying upon all they 
encounter as is their right as superior warriors. Hrug-
gek takes the heads of those he kills and puts them 
on spikes in his den, where they utter pleas for mercy 
and sing paeans to his might. Grankhul watches over 
Hruggek when he sleeps, but if he must be elsewhere, 
he whispers commands to the severed heads to wake 
Hruggek if ahy danger threatens him. 
Bugbears admire the qualities of both brothers. 
Because of Hruggek, they consider bravery and phys-
ical superiority to be their natural state. Thanks to 
Grankhul, they can use their size and strength to work 
as stealthy assassins rather than blundering around 
like ogres. 
Bullying, murder, and engaging in battle are all holy 
acts for bugbears. Garroting an unsuspecting crea-
ture and defeating foes in open battle are seen as acts 
of worship, in the same way that dwarves consider 
metalsmithing to be sacred to Moradin. 
The bugbears recognize two other gods, both of which 
they disdain and fear: Maglubiyet and Skiggaret. 
Maglubiyet, the leader of the goblinoid pantheon, 
forced both brothers to submit to his rule, but instead of 
killing them, he showed mercy and even honored them 
in a way by setting them free-under his control-so that 
bugbears could continue to employ their talents against 
his enemies. Bugbears understand that by venerating 
Hruggek and Grankhul, they also give tribute to Ma-
glubiyet, even though they don't openly pay homage to 
their overlord. When bugbears are called to join a host, 
bugbears believe Maglubiyet has again corralled the 
brothers into a divine battle, and they honor their gods 
by following suit.
