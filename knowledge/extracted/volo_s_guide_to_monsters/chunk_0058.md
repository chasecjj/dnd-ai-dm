TACTICS 
Because they are physically weak individually, kobolds 
know they have to use superior numbers and cunning 
to take down powerful foes. In addition to their Pack 
Tactics trait described in the Monster Manual, they use 
traps, ambushes, terrain, allied monsters, and any other 
advantage they can squeeze out of their environment. 
Essentially, the only way kobolds can win is not to 
play fair. 
Kobolds work together to accomplish difficult tasks 
they couldn't manage alone. They carve intricate tunnel 
systems that enable them to hold off and discourage ene-
mies several times their size. Without engaging in much 
verbal communication, each kobold knows what has to 
be done to succeed. Kobolds' ability to work together 
is remarkable, especially compared to the behavior 
of other small humanoids like goblins, which tend to 
squabble among themselves and cooperate only when 
threatened by a strong leader. 
Kobolds avoid combat on a large scale, instead stick-
ing to hit-and-run raids using smaller groups of war-
riors. If they have time, they prepare the battlefield with 
small bolt-holes for them to hide in and simple pit traps 
to hamper their opponents. 
Standard kobold tactics include the following: 
• Attacking light sources to extinguish them, so the ko-
bolds can use their darkvision to best advantage. 
• Leaving one defender in a room to lure invaders into 
a trap or an ambush. Often this bait is a sick or weak 
kobold who is otherwise unable to contribute to the 
tribe's needs. 
• Using hit-and-run maneuvers, fleeing between at-
tacks to better or more secure vantage points. Often 
their goal is to attract enemies and draw the foes into 
greater danger, which can be especially effective if the 
invaders have made camp, are injured, or are other-
wise compromised (such as having to move by climb-
ing or swimming). 
• Using poison, usually harvested from vermin such as 
centipedes and spiders. They might extract the poison 
and use it on their weapons, or leave a chest or a clay 
pot full of the vermin in obvious places as false "trea-
sure," prompting intruders to open the container and 
release a swarm. 
In a combat involving large numbers of kobolds (such 
as ten or more), consider spreading out their attacks 
over the round instead of having them all act on the 
same initiative count. Doing this gives the kobolds more 
opportunities to react to what their enemies do, and 
makes it harder for players to coordinate their charac-
ters' attacks because not all the kobolds take their ac-
tions at the same time. 
TREASURE 
Because they live underground, kobolds have access to 
a remarkable amount of earth-based treasures such as 
metal ores and unpolished gems. They have the basic 
skill to extract metals found in their natural state and 
to polish raw gemstones. Although they don't create 
their own coinage, nuggets of raw metals used for trade, 
bribes, or crafting are commonly found in kobold lairs. 
Kobolds are talented at crafting, so most tribes have 
a remarkable amount of treasure in the form of simple 
jewelry, such as armbands, rings, necklaces, and other 
items that are small or can be constructed out of small 
pieces. These adornments are always fashioned so that 
they don't make noise when the wearer moves, as that 
would make it difficult for a kobold to sneak anywhere. 
Even though the jewelry they make has no functional 
purpose, kobolds savor these items, perhaps as some 
echo of a dragon's inclination to collect treasure. Be-
cause the tribe's wealth is portable, the kobolds can 
relocate quickly without needing to transport containers 
of nuggets and gems, and they can offer these items as 
bribes or tribute to more powerful creatures, or as reli-
gious offerings to a dragon. 
ALLIES, MINIONS, AND PETS 
Thanks to their lack of physical prowess and their 
small size, kobolds are rarely in a position to dominate 
other creatures, so they usually don't have minions. 
Even when the opportunity presents itself, kobolds 
would rather not try to enslave or hire any intelligent 
creatures because they can't trust such creatures to not 
turn on them. 
Kobolds are good, however, at capturing and taming 
smaller animals and beasts, particularly rats, dire rats, 
and reptilian creatures like lizards that thrive in a cave 
or underground environment. The kobolds corral these 
pets or allow them to roam free, either feeding them 
scraps or allowing them to forage for insects and other 
morsels too small for the kobolds to care about. Much 
in the way that human villagers keep chickens, these 
animals help the kobolds with pest control and are oc-
casionally used as food. Giant rats and similarly sized 
lizards are also used as pack animals and guardians. 
Some tribes train giant weasels to serve as mounts or 
guardians, relying on their speed, keen senses, and abil-
ity to fit in kobold-sized tunnels. Other tribes use giant 
bats as mounts and guard animals, but the bats require 
a lot of space in which to move and are found only in 
lairs that feature large caves or close access to the sur-
face world. 
Kobolds are cautious and fearful of bears, since bears 
often seek to live in caves and the animals might wander 
into the outermost parts of the lair, particularly when 
they're about to begin hibernating. Kobolds are likely 
to panic when they see a bear animal companion in the 
company of another creature. This aversion extends to 
owlbears and other bear-like creatures.
