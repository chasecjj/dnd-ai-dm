WARLOCK OF THE GREAT OLD ONE 
Warlocks of the Great Old One gain their powers 
through magical pacts forged with eldritch entities from 
strange and distant realms of existence. Some of these 
warlocks associate with cultists devoted to these enti-
ties, as well as aberrations that share their goals, yet 
other warlocks of the Great Old One are experts at root-
ing out the insanity and wickedness inspired by bizarre 
beings from beyond the stars. 
WARLORD 
Warlords are legendary battlefield commanders whose 
names are spoken with awt. After a string of decisive 
victories, a warlord could easily take on the role of mon-
arch or general and attract followers willing to die for 
his or her banner.
