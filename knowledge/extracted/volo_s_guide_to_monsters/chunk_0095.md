T ABAXI TRAITS 
Your tabaxi character has the following racial traits. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in-
creases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. 
Ase. Tabaxi have lifespans equivalent to humans. 
Ali;nment. Tabaxi tend toward chaotic alignments, 
as they let impulse and fancy guide their decisions. They 
are rarely evil, with most of them driven by curiosity 
rather than greed or other dark impulses. 
TABAXI IN THE fORCiOTTEN REALMS 
In the Forgotten Realms, tabaxi hail from Maztica, a realm 
located far across the ocean west of the Sword Coast. The 
tabaxi of Maztica are known for their isolation, and until 
recently they never ventured from their homeland. The 
tabaxi say little of why that has changed, though rumors 
persist of strange happenings in that distant land. 
Size. Tabaxi are taller on average than humans and 
relatively slender. Your size is Medium. 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Darkvision. You have a cat's keen senses, especially 
in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of 
you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only 
shades of gray. 
Feline A;ility. Your reflexes and agility allow you to 
meve with a burst of speed. When you move on your 
turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end 
of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again 
until you move O feet on one of your turns. 
Cat's Claws. Because of your claws, you have a climb-
ing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural 
weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. 
If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 
ld4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning 
damage normal for an unarmed strike. 
Cat's Talent. You have proficiency in the Perception 
and Stealth skills. 
Lan; ua;es. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and one other language of your choice. 
TRITON 
AH, THE TRITONS. IMAGINE IF THE ELVES SPENT A FEW 
centuries far beneath the sea, where their arrogance and 
pretension could grow undisturbed. At least the tritons 
spent that time fighting sahuagin and worse, so you know 
you can count on them in a fight. 
-Brego Stoneheart, sea captain 
Tritons guard the ocean depths, building small settle-
ments beside deep trenches, portals to the elemental 
planes, and other dangerous spots far from the eyes of 
land-bound folk. Long-established guardians of the deep 
ocean floor, in recent years the noble tritons have be-
come increasingly active in the world above. 
AQUATIC CRUSADERS 
Centuries ago, tritons entered the world in response 
to the growing threat of evil elementals. Tritons waged 
many wars against their enemies on the Plane of Wa-
ter, driving them into the Darkened Depths where they 
escaped into the crushing pressure and utter darkness. 
In time, the tritons noticed that their ancient elemental 
foes had grown quiet. Expeditions to the depths re-
vealed that krakens, sahuagin, and far worse foes had 
fled the Plane of Water for the Material Plane. 
The tritons, driven by a sense of duty and responsi-
bility, would not allow their foes to escape so easily. 
A great conclave of tritons chose volunteers skilled in 
weapons and magic as part of an expeditionary force to 
enter the Material Plane and seek out their enemies. 
Those tritons spread across the world's oceans and es-
tablished protectorates to watch over deep sea trenches, 
portals, undersea caves, and other locations where their 
enemies might lurk. They defeated their foes when they 
found them and drove the rest into hiding .
