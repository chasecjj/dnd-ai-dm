MOUTH OF GROLANTOR 
Hill giants know the kinds of foods that make them 
fatter, and they understand that exerting themselves too 
much tends to make them thinner. What the lazy brutes 
don't comprehend are the things that make them sick. 
They consume spoiled food and diseased carcasses 
with as much enthusiasm as children eating dessert. 
Fortunately for hill giants, they have a vulture's constitu-
tion and rarely suffer for such eating habits. This makes 
it all the more mysterious to them when one of their 
kind becomes ill and incapable of keeping down food. 
Vomiting hill giants are seen as vessels of a message 
from Grolantor. 
The clan separates the sickened giant from the others, 
often trapping the giant in a cage or tying the giant to 
a post. A priest of Grolantor or chieftain visits the fam-
ished giant daily, trying to read portents in the puddles 
of bile the hill giant retched up. If the sickness soon 
passes, the hill giant can rejoin society. If not, the hill 
giant is instead starved to the point of madness so that 
Grolantor's hunger can be given a mouth in the world. 
Starved and Insane, A mouth of Grolantor is so dis-
graced that it ceases to be an individual and becomes 
an object. Paradoxically, that object is revered as a holy 
embodiment of Grolantor's eternal, aching hunger. 
Unlike a typical thick, sluggish, half-asleep hill giant, a 
mouth of Grolantor is thin as a whippet, alert like a bird, 
and constantly twitching around the edges. A mouth of 
Grolantor is kept perpetually imprisoned or shackled; 
if it breaks free, it's sure to kill a few hill giants before 
it's brought down or it sprints away on a killing spree. 
The only time a mouth of Grolantor is set loose is during 
a war, a raid against an enemy settlement, or in a last-
ditch defense of the tribe's home. When the mouth of 
Grolantor has slaughtered and eaten its fill of the tribe's 
enemies, it passes out amid the gory remains of its vic-
tims, making it easy to recapture.
