KI-RIN 
Ki-rins are noble, celestial creatures. In the Outer 
Planes, ki-rins in service to benevolent deities take a 
direct role in the eternal struggle between good and evil. 
In the mortal world, a ki-rin is celebrated far and wide 
as a harbinger of destiny, a guardian of the sacred, and a 
counterbalance to the forces of evil. 
Good Personified. Ki-rins are the embodiment of 
good, and simply beholding one can evoke fear or awe in 
an observer. A typical ki-rin looks like a muscular stag 
the size of an elephant, covered in golden scales lined 
in some places with golden fur. It has a dark gold mane 
and tail, coppery cloven hooves, and a spiral-shaped 
coppery horn just above and between its luminous violet 
eyes. In a breeze or when aloft, the creature's scales and 
hair can create the impression that the ki-rin is ablaze 
with a holy, golden fire. 
Beyond their coloration, ki-rins vary in appearance, 
based on the deity each one reveres and the function 
it typically performs in service to that god. Some are 
horse-shaped, looking like gigantic unicorns, and are 
often used as guardians. Others have draconic features 
and tend to be aggressive foes of evil. One horn is most 
common, but a ki-rin of fierce demeanor might have two 
horns or a set of antlers like those of a great stag. 
Bringers of Boons. Common folk consider ki-rins to 
be rare and remote heralds of good fortune. Seeing a ki-

Innate Spellcasting. The ki-rin's innate spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 17). The ki-rin can innately cast the 
following spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: gaseous form, major image (6th-level version), wind walk 
1/day: create food and water 
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the ki-rin fails a saving throw, 
it can choose to succeed instead. 
Magic Resistance. The ki-rin has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Magic Weapons. The ki-rin's weapon attacks are magical. 
Spellcasting. The ki-rin is a 18th-level spellcaster. Its spell-
casting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell 
attacks). It has the following cleric spells prepared: 
rin fly overhead is a blessing, and events that happen on 
such a day are especially auspicious. If a ki-rin alights 
during a ceremony, such as a birth announcement or 
a coronation, everyone present understands that the 
creature is telling them great good could be in the offing. 
The ki-rin conveys its gifts and omens, then rises back 
into the sky. Ki-rins have also been known to appear at 
the sites of great battles to inspire and strengthen the 
side of good, or to rescue heroes from certain death. 
A ki-rin in the world claims a territory to watch over, 
and one ki-rin might safeguard an area that encom-
passes several nations. On other planes, ki-rins that 
serve good deities go wherever they are commanded, 
which could include coming to the Material Plane on a 
mission. A ki-rin disciple in the world usually serves its 
deity as a scout, a messenger, or a spy. 
Ki-rins are attracted to the worship of deities of 
courage, loyalty, selflessness, and truth, as well as the 
advancement of just societies. For instance, in Faerfin, 
ki-rins rally mostly to Torm, although ki-rins also serve 
his allies Tyr and Ilmater. 
Ofdects of Adoration. Because a ki-rin is renowned 
for its wisdom, other creatures would naturally seek it 
out with questions and requests if they could. For that 
reason among others, the creature makes its lair atop a 
forbidding mountain peak or in some other equally in-
accessible location. Only those that have the tenacity to
