crisscross it, running from each gate through the center 
of the camp and out the other side. This configuration 
enables all the goblinoids to swiftly rally and exit the 
camp en masse to meet an approaching threat. 
COMMAND CENTER 
The camp's warlord resides in the command center, 
which is a large wooden building in the middle of camp. 
Here the warlord meets with advisors and makes plans 
for future conquest. Most of the time, a command center 
also holds elite bugbear bodyguards that protect the 
warlord and a goblin jester that serves as insurance 
against the appearance of a nilbog (see the "Nilbogs: 
Pranksters with Power" sidebar). 
In a camp that doesn't have separate facilities for a 
library and a rookery, the command center subsumes 
those functions. Library records are stored in a chamber 
adjacent to where the war council meets, and posts for 
ravens are set all around the exterior of the building. 
GOBLINOID QUARTERS 
Each type of goblinoid has its own accommodations 
within the war camp. 
Busbear Dens. After the hobgoblins stake out their 
territory, bugbear gangs dig their dens wherever else 
they wish, sometimes building them in the shadow of 
the outer wall but most often scattering them about, 
seemingly at random. A den typically consists of a hole 
and a crawlspace big enough for a few bugbears. 
Goblin Hovels. The camp's goblins settle wherever 
their hobgoblin commanders tell them to. Their quarters 
usually surround the areas where slaves and beasts. 
The typical goblin hovel is a round tent where related 
goblins sleep. In a permanent camp, these hovels often 
take the form of wattle-and-daub huts. 
Hobsoblin Barracks. Not surprisingly, hobgoblins 
have the most spacious and well-appointed quarters in 
a war camp. Each of the banners in a legion has its own 
group of lodges in one of the quadrants of the interior, 
each one facing the pathway that runs past its front door. 
LIBRARY 
Hobgoblins know the value of improving one's base of 
knowledge, and so they value any documentation about 
the world around them-maps, accounting records, bat-
tle reports, and other important facts. This knowledge 
is sorted by a legion's librarian and stored in the camp's 
library. The library serves as a hub for communication 
and strategy, and it is never located far from the group's 
leaders. In the field, the army's library is carried in a 
fortified and fire-protected wagon, surrounded by bat-
tle-hardened caretakers (often devastators or Iron Shad-
ows) willing to give their lives to protect it. 
PENS AND PITS 
Goblins are responsible for tending to the camp's slaves, 
battle beasts, and beasts of burden. These are hobbled, 
chained to posts, or placed in pens, cages, or pits as 
needed. Most of these containment sites are surrounded 
by goblin hovels, and those that aren't are nearby, so 
that the goblins can keep track of their charges.

ROOKERY 
Hobgoblins keep flocks of ravens that serve them as 
messengers and spies. A huge, tree-like conglomera-
tion of metal and wood serves the ravens as a roosting 
and nesting place. If a camp doesn't use one of these 
freestanding structures, its ravens are accommodated 
by perches and outcrops built on the outside of the 
command center. In the field, a wagon serves as a make-
shift rookery. 
SUPPLY WAGONS 
Members of the army are expected to maintain their 
own battle gear, but ammunition and replacement gear 
are kept on hand, as well as other nonperishable sup-
plies. Rather than being contained in a building, these 
items are on wagons distributed throughout the camp in 
such a way that all the vehicles are accessible and ready 
to be moved if the rallying horn is blown. 
Every wagon is under watch by at least two guards, 
which are responsible for recording "withdrawals" and 
reporting on inventory to the camp's leaders. 
THE BLOCK 
Maglubiyet's holy symbol is a headsman's axe, and the 
block is where it is blessed by feeding it the lifeblood of 
conquered foes and goblinoids that neglect their duties. 
In a temporary camp, the block might be a simple slab of 
wood or stone laid on a hastily heaped-up pile of dirt. In 
a permanent garrison, the block is often attached to the 
command center and placed on a consecrated platform. 
Near the block stands a post or a rack with various 
weapons that represent the symbols of the goblinoid 
gods, each placed in accordance with the god's rank. 
Maglubiyet's headsman's axe is always highest. Then 
comes Nomog-Geaya's sword and handaxe, Bargrivyek's 
white-tipped flail, and at the bottom, often touching the 
ground, the red-and-yellow whip of Khurgorbaeyag. 
Notably absent from this grouping are the symbols 
of the bugbear gods. Instead, severed heads hang in 
bunches around the block or are impaled upon spikes, 
their eyelids removed and mouths open. These honor 
the bugbears' deities, Hruggek and Grankhul, and their 
separate but subordinate positions in Maglubiyet's rule. 
HAGS: DARK SISTERHOOD 
Hags are crones who represent corruption of ideals and 
goals, and they delight in seeing the innocent and good 
brought low. They are inhuman monsters, their forms 
twisted by evil. Shapechangers and blasphemers, they 
ally with other hags to form magical covens with extra 
powers. They collect and remember secret knowledge 
that is better lost and forgotten. Desperate mortals come 
to them looking for advice, only to have their requests 
fulfilled in ways that bring great suffering to themselves 
and their lqved ones. 
UGLY, UNPREDICTABLE, AND OLD 
Hags are mysterious, unfathomable, and dangerous, 
especially from the viewpoint of mortals. One day a hag 
might be stealing and eating children that wander into 
the woods, on another day she might be making lewd 
jokes to adventurers asking her for advice, and the next 
she might be uprooting saplings to make a fence around 
her home for impaling intruders. It is nearly impossible 
to predict how a hag will act from day to day, sometimes 
moment to moment, which is why folk with any wisdom 
at all give hags a wide berth. 
Hags perceive ugliness as beauty, and vice versa. They 
revel in having a hideous appearance and sometimes go 
out of their way "improve" upon it by picking at sores, 
wearing skins and bones as decoration, and rubbing re-
fuse and dirt into their hair and clothing. 
Because both the Seelie Court and the Unseelie Court 
appreciate and revere true beauty among the fey, hags 
are almost never found in either place. The Summer 
Queen and the Queen of Air and Darkness recognize 
that hags have valuable knowledge and impressive 
magic, but they can't abide the stain on the beauty of 
their surroundings, so most hags are excluded from 
both courts. The rare few accepted as courtiers are 
either so influential that their entry can't be refused, or 
young and humble enough to be willing to use magic to 
put on a prettier appearance. Other hags aren't upset 
by their exclusion; they like to be left alone to their own 
schemes, not constrained by a fey queen's whims, and to 
be able to talk out of both sides of their mouths. 
Hags are virtually immortal, with a life span greater 
than that of even dragons and elves. The oldest, wisest, 
and most powerful hags are called "grandmothers" by 
other hags. Some grandmothers are nearly as powerful 
as some of the archfey. 
Hags of lower but still respectable status are called 
"aunties." An auntie gains her status from being very 
old, a member of a powerful coven, directly serving a 
grandmother, or having many offspring (whether ad-
opted or birthed). 
MASTER MANIPULATORS 
Hags delight in corrupting others. They do so not by 
imposing their will or being outwardly violent, but by 
making sinister bargains with those who seek their aid. 
This desire to orchestrate the downfall of others is why 
so many hags make their homes near humanoid settle-
ments, which gives them a ready supply of creatures to 
tantalize and torment. 
Folk with nowhere else to turn are some of a hag's 
best customers. A farmer with a philandering spouse 
might seek out the local hag for a potion to make the 
spouse faithful again. The mayor with a demented fa-
ther might ask the hag for something that makes him 
lucid again. A merchant whose child is deathly ill might 
go to the hag for a cure. The common element in these 
situations is that the mortals approach the hag for help; 
despite knowing that she is evil and dangerous, they are 
desperate enough to risk making a bargain with her, or 
foolish enough to think they can persuade her to be help-
ful without getting something in return.
