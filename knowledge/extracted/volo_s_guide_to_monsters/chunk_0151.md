NEOGI 
Neogi are hateful slavers that consider most other crea-
tures, even weaker neogi, to be servants and prey. A 
neogi looks like an outsize spider with an eel's neck and 
head. The creature can poison the body and the mind of 
its target, able to subjugate other beings that are other-
wise physically superior. 
Alien Tyrants. Neogi usually dwell in far-flung loca-
tions on the Material Plane, as well as in the Feywild, 
the Shadowfell, and the Astral and Ethereal Planes. 
They invaded the world long ago from a remote loca-
tion on the Material Plane, abandoning their home to 
conquer and devour creatures in other realms. To meet 
their need to navigate great distances, the neogi first 
dominated and assimilated the umber hulks of another 
lost world. Then, with these slaves providing the phys-
ical labor, the neogi designed and built sleek vessels, 
some capable of traversing the planes, to carry them to 
their new frontiers. Some neogi groups still create and 
use such vehicles, which have a distinct spidery aspect. 
Some neogi use magic-the result of a pact between 
the neogi and aberrant entities they met during their 
journey from their home world. These entities look 
like stars and embody the essence of evil. They are 
known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, 
and Hadar. 
Nothing about the neogi is more unf3rthomable than 
their mentality. Because they have the power to control 
minds, neogi consider doing so to be entirely appro-
priate. Their society makes no distinction between 
individuals, aside from the ability that a given creature 
has to control others, and they don't comprehend the 
emotional aspects of existence that humans and similar 
beings experience. To a neogi, hatred is as foreign a 
sensation as love, and showing loyalty in the absence of 
authority is foolishness. 
Cycle of Death and Life. A neogi lives about as 
long as a human, and like a human it faces phys-
ical and mental infirmity as it ages. When an 
individual is rendered weak by advanced age, 
the other neogi in the group overpower it and 
inject it with a special poison. The toxin trans-
forms the old neogi into a bloated, helpless 
mass of flesh called a great old master. Young 
neogi lay their eggs atop it, and when the hatch-
lings emerge, they devour the great old master 
and one another, until only a few of the strongest 
newborns are left. 
Hierarchy of Ownership. Surviving neogi 
hatchlings begin their lives under the control 
of adult neogi. They must learn about their so-
ciety and earn a place in it, and each one starts 
its training by gaining mastery over a young 
umber hulk. 
Neogi mark themselves and their slaves 
through the use of dyes, transformational magic, 
and tattoos intended to signify rank, achieve-
ments, and ownership. By these signs, each neogi 
can identify its betters- and it must defer to those 
of higher station or risk harsh punishment.
