develop a healthy respect for those not of their kind. 
They treat especially powerful creatures and individuals 
as equals, not adversaries, and seek to cooperate with 
them. A renegade mind flayer might become a trusted 
advisor or a powerful ally, so long as it is kept well fed. 
Any alliance it makes, however, collapses if the mind 
flayer falls under the sway of an elder brain once more. 
ENEMIES EVERYWHERE 
Elder brains seek stability and safety for their colonies, 
and a colony can remain in a relatively peaceful state for 
decades if it can evade discovery while it acquires food. 
Two kinds of events can disrupt the tranquility of a 
colony: an invasion and the appearance of an ulitharid. 
THE GITH NEVER REST 
Githzerai and githyanki remember the mind flayers' 
enslavement of their ancestors. They dispatch hunting 
parties to the Material Plane to root out and slaughter 
illithids wherever they can find them. After centuries of 
hunting, they have grown very skilled at it. Every mind 
flayer colony is constantly on the alert for an incursion 
of gith, even if it has never had to fight them off before. 
Underdark predators, adventurers, and other kinds 
of formidable creatures are just as much of a threat to a 
colony. Although the mind flayers and their elder brain 
are incredibly powerful, they aren't invincible: highly 
accomplished heroes, drow raiding parties, rampant de-
mons, and other hazards of the Underdark can decimate 
a colony even if they don't succeed in destroying the 
elder brain. 
RISE OF A ULITHARID 
Rarely, the process of ceremorphosis yields an ulitharid, 
a more powerful mind flayer that isn't beholden to the 
elder brain's whims. 
The appearance of an ulitharid causes a surge in the 
colony's collective intelligence, creativity, and strength. 
As the ulitharid gains power by devouring brains and 
honing its psionic abilities, the colony becomes more 
aggressive, seeking to gather more and more thralls. 
Eventually, if the colony grows to sufficient size, the 
ulitharid strikes out on its own. Half the mind flayers 
and thralls in the colony undertake a great migration, 
seeking a new lair at least 100 miles away from the 
old one. Once the ulitharid finds a suitable spot, its fol-
lowers construct a new lair while it transforms into an 
elder brain. 
Although a creature as arrogant and ambitious as an 
elder brain might resent an ulitharid's rise, it under-
stands that the mind flayers can't rebuild their shattered 
empire without expanding their reach. It might resent 
its new rival, but it can take comfort that soon enough 
the ulitharid will strike out on its own and the colony 
will return to normal. 
THE GRAND DESIGN 
The first priority of any mind flayer colony is to survive. 
The elder brain and its servants seek to remain hidden, 
typically deep within the earth, while harvesting enough 
intelligent humanoids to nourish themselves and allow 
for slow but steady growth.

Once a colony is secure, it focuses on the Grand 
Design-the mind flayers' plan to rebuild their lost em-
pire. The illithids know that reclaiming their rightful 
place in the world is possible only after the githzerai 
and githyanki have been eliminated and the remaining 
humanoids have been turned into docile slaves. To that 
end, each colony conducts research into the nature of 
the world and the creatures that inhabit it. The mind 
flayers examine all facets of reality, seeking any knowl-
edge that could give them the edge they need to con-
front, defeat, and subjugate their enemies. 
Every colony investigates a wide variety of topics and 
phenomena. A few members might focus on straightfor-
ward projects such as developing new uses for psionic 
power or how to breed savage creatures to serve as foot 
soldiers. Others pursue more theoretical subjects. A 
mind flayer might study musical tones, for example, in 
hopes of finding a way to manipulate the emotions of 
humanoids. Another might research the food human-
oids eat to see if their diet or agricultural practices can 
be exploited. No line of inquiry is too esoteric if it might 
provide the next step in enacting the Grand Design. 
STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES 
Since mind flayers need to settle near a source of food, 
they must determine how best to interact with the hu-
manoids they intend to conquer. A colony usually adopts 
one of three approaches to dealing with its neighbors. 
Control. A colony that desperately needs to increase 
its population concentrates on capturing humanoids to 
turn them into thralls and illithids. Operating individ-
ually or in small groups, its members use stealth and 
deception to infiltrate the humanoid community while 
keeping their presence secret. Lacking the numbers or 
the ability to overwhelm and dominate the entire popu-
lation, a colony turns its research toward more effective 
ways to exert control, such as finding a way to amplify 
an elder brain's power to enable it to exert influence over 
a greater distance. 
Destruction. Because mind flayers are physically 
weak, they can't rely on simple combat to stand up 
against their enemies. If a colony finds itself in cir-
cumstances where it can be outwardly aggressive, its 
members likely focus their research on ways to cause 
mass casualties with minimal risk to themselves, such 
as plagues or methods to bring about famine and other 
natural disasters. A mind flayer colony using this strat-
egy collects and feeds on humanoids mainly to use 
the knowledge they gain to understand their victims' 
strengths and weaknesses, with the ultimate goal of 
finding a way to dispense with all of them at once. 
Subversion. As a compromise between control and 
destruction, a colony might attempt to seize control of 
a few key elements of a humanoid community, and then 
mix in a few, calculated destructive acts to send the 
humanoids into an inexorable decline. If the illithids 
can engineer the collapse of a society's central author-
ity, such as by inciting years of famine while driving 
the local nobility to bouts of madness through psionic 
assaults, they can create widespread unrest that the 
colony can use to its advantage. The mind flayers can 
become more expansion-minded, confident that any 
response from the humanoids will be too scattered to 
threaten them. 
SPECIAL GOALS 
Many of the esoteric research topics pursued by a col-
ony reflect the ambitions and priorities ofthe elder brain 
that controls it. Each one has particular ideas about how 
best to contribute to the ultimate success of the Grand 
Design, including these possibilities: 
• The discovery and destruction of all githyanki creches 
• Collecting creatures and instigating insanity in them 
to create new flavors of thought 
• Fostering a school of wizardry to attract intelligent 
minds for the colony to feed upon 
• Rediscovering the secrets of nautiloid manufacture to 
take to the sky 
• Drawing a surface city into the Underdark so as to 
have a population of ready victims 
ROLEPLAYING A MIND FLAYER 
Mind flayers are inhuman monsters that typically exist 
as part of a collective colony mind. Yet illithids aren't 
drones to an elder brain. Each has a brilliant mind, per-
sonality, and motivations of its own.
