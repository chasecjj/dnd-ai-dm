ENVIRONMENT 
...... 
Kobolds are cold-blooded and thus prefer temperate and 
tropical climates. Kobold tribes in colder regions tend 
to be smaller in population and more aggressive in their 
hunting, since food is relatively scarce in such areas. 
Partly out of fear and partly because their eyes are 
sensitive to sunlight, kobolds prefer the security of a 
cave to living in the open air, and can be found in any 
sort of terrain that can support tunneling. In a swamp 
or along a coastline where digging into the soft ground 
is problematic, kobolds entrench themselves in dense 
woods, hills, or large rock outcroppings, creating war-
rens above the water line. 
Kobolds reside most commonly in hilly or mountain-
ous terrain. Such locations usually have natural caves 
suitable for living space, plenty of room to dig, and ready 
sources of food. Although lairing in these locations 
puts kobolds in competition with surface-dwelling hu-
manoids, their ability to avoid detection often means 
their warrens go unnoticed by their larger rivals. If it's 
lucky, a tribe of kobolds that is discovered by a group 
of larger humanoids might form a mutually beneficial 
arrangement, relying on the humanoids for protection 
from invaders and in return providing services such as 
excavating new living spaces and disposing of trash. If 
it's unlucky, the tribe is enslaved by the other human-
oids, and the kobolds serve similar roles but under 
threat of death. 
ROLEPLAYING A KOBOLD 
A kobold acknowledges its weakness in the face of a 
hostile world. It knows it is puny, bigger creatures will 
exploit it, it will probably die at a young age, and its life 
will be full of toil. Although this outlook seems bleak, a 
kobold finds satisfaction in its work, the survival of its 
tribe, and the knowledge that it shares a heritage with 
the mightiest of dragons. 
A kobold isn't clever, but it isn't as stupid as an ore. 
Someone can fool a kobold with smooth words or a 
quick wit, but when the kobold figures out it has been 
tricked, it remembers the affront. If it gets an opportu-
nity to do so, it will retaliate against that person some-
how, even if in merely a petty way. 
A kobold doesn't like being cornered or alone. It wants 
to know it has a safe path for escape, or at least an ally 
nearby to improve its chances. A kobold without either 
of these options will be nervous, its behavior alternating 
between meek silence and hysteria. 
URDS: WINCiED KOBOLDS 
Winged kobolds, known as urds, hatch seemingly at ran-
dom from kobold eggs, even in a tribe that has no adult 
urds. Although being able to fly is an incredible gift, and 
it would be expected for kobolds to interpret the wings as 
a blessing from Tiamat, ordinary kobolds resent urds and 
don't get along with them. Fragments of kobold legends 
speak of Kuraulyek, a winged godling servant of Kurtul-
mak, who betrayed his master in some way. Kobolds see 
urds as Kuraulyek's favorites, and they project their resent· 
ment of this traitor onto their winged kin. 
KOBOLD NAMES 
Kobold names are derived from the Draconic tongue 
and usually relate to a characteristic of the owner, such 
as scale color, distinctive body parts, or typical behavior. 
For example, "Red Foot," "White Claw," and "Scurry" 
are Common translations of often-used names. A kobold 
might change its name when it becomes an adult, or add 
additional word-syllables after important events such as 
completing its first hunt, laying its first egg, or surviving 
its first battle. The Kobold Names table presents kobold 
names suitable for any campaign.

PHYSICAL VARIATIONS 
Kobolds vary widely in how their scales are colored 
and patterned. Although a human might have difficulty 
telling two similar-looking kobolds apart, the kobolds 
themselves can easily recognize each other. 
Most kobolds of the same tribe tend to have similar 
coloration. For example, the Copper Tooth tribe might 
be mostly gray with red stripes. Two tribes that merge 
eventually crossbreed enough to create a new look, 
although occasional outliers and throwbacks are born 
that bear the appearance of one of the original tribes. 
Use the Scale Color table to randomly determine the 
predominant appearance of kobolds in a tribe. If the roll 
on the table indicates a patterned appearance, roll on 
the Scale Pattern table to determine how the two colors 
are combined.
