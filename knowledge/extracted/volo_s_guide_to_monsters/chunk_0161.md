SHADOW MASTIFF 
These black hounds of the Shadowfell move invisibly 
through the shadows, always on the hunt. In gloomy 
places where the veil between the Shadowfell and the 
Material Plane is thinnest, they can cross over into the 
dark realms of the world. 
Ravenous Lurkers. Shadow mastiffs hunt in packs 
on the Shadowfell, so when one of them enters a rift 
between the planes, several more are sure to follow. 
Each pack is led by an alpha (male or female) that is the 
smartest and toughest one of the group. The alpha must 
remain sharp to keep the rest of the pack in line, lest it 
be killed and replaced. 
When a shadow mastiff pack is hungry and senses 
prey nearby, the alpha lets loose a howl that strikes fear 
into the hearts of nearby beasts and humanoids. Its howl 
is also a signal to the rest of the pack to move in for the 
kill. Gloom provides a shadow mastiff with supernatural 
protection, granting it resistance to nonmagical weap-
ons white in dim light or darkness. Shadow mastiffs can 
tolerate bright light, but they shun sunlight. 
Summoned for Service. Some faiths devoted to de-
ities of gloom and night, such as Shar in the Forgotten 
Realms, perform unholy rites to summon shadow mas-
tiffs from the Shadowfell and then put them to work as 
temple sentinels, bodyguards, and punishers of nonbe-
lievers, heretics, and apostates. The method for bringing 
shadow mastiffs into the world is also known by other 
strong-willed and evil-minded individuals, who find use 
for the hounds as guards in their strongholds. 
Ethereal Sight. In addition to its other capabilities, 
a shadow mastiff can see creatures and objects on the 
Ethereal Plane. This extraplanar perception makes a 
mastiff an especially skilled guardian, especially in situ-
ations when magical or spiritual incursion is likely. 
SHADOW MASTIFF ALPHA 
A shadow mastiff alpha has the statistics of a normal 
shadow mastiff, with the following modifications: 
• The alpha has above average (42-54) hit points. 
• It has an Intelligence of 6 (-2). 
• It has the Terrifying Howl action option described below. 
Terrifying Howl. The shadow mastiff howls. Any beast or 
humanoid within 300 feet of the mastiff and able to hear 
its howl must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw 
or be frightened for l minute. A frightened target can 
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving 
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is 
immune to any shadow mastiff's Terrifying Howl for the 
next 24 hours.
