Inferior Tyrant. A beholder usually drives away or 
kills any gauths that enter its territory, but it might choose 
to enslave them and use them as lieutenants. Gauths are 
less xenophobic than beholders, so they might form 
small clusters and work together, though they're just as 
likely to ignore each other entirely. 
GAZER 
A gazer is a tiny manifestation of a beholder's dreams. It 
resembles the beholder who dreamed it into existence, 
but its body is only 8 inches wide, and it has only four 
eyestalks. lt follows its creator like a devoted, aggressive 
puppy, and sometimes small packs of these creatures 
patrol their master's lair for vermin to kill and lone crea-
tures to harass. 
Nuisance Pet. A gazer can't speak any languages but 
can approximate mimicking words and sentences in a 
high-pitched, mocking manner. Beholders find gazers 
amusing and tolerate their presence like spoiled pets. 
A gazer can't be tamed by anyone but its creator, except 
through the use of magic or by bonding with a spell-
caster (see sidebar). Some beholders with wizard min-
ions insist they take a gazer as a familiar because they 
can see through the eyes of these creatures. 
AggressiveVermin-Eater. A wild gazer (one living 
separately from a beholder) is territorial, eats bugs and 
small animals, and is known for playing with its food. 
A lone gazer avoids picking fights with creatures that 
are Medium or larger, but a pack of them might take 
on larger prey. A gazer might follow humanoids in its 
territory, noisily mimicking their speech and generally 
being a nuisance, until they leave the area, but it flees if 
confronted by something it can't kill. 
Variant:
GAZER FAMILIAR 
Spellcasters who are interested in unusual familiars find 
that gazers are eager to serve someone who has magical 
power, especially those who make a point of bullying and 
harassing others. The gazer behaves aggressively toward 
creatures smaller than itself, and it tends to randomly at-
tack house pets, farm animals, and even children in town 
unless its master is very strict. A gazer serving as a familiar 
has the following trait. 
Familiar. The gazer can serve another creature as a fa. 
miliar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master, 
provided that the mater is at least a 3rd-level spellcaster. 
While the two are bonded, the master can sense what 
the gazer senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each 
other. If its master causes it physical harm, the gazer will 
end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

Aggressive. As a bonus action, the gazer can move up to its 
speed toward a hostile creature that it can see. 
Mimic:ry. The gazer can mimic simple sounds of speech it has 
heard, in any language. A creature that hears the sounds can 
tell they are ,imitations with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (In-
sight) check. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attac:k: +S to hit, reach S ft., one target. 
Hit: 1 piercing damage. 
Eye Rays. The gazer shoots two of the following magical eye 
rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one or two targets 
it can see within 60 feet ofit: 
1. Dazing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 
12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of the 
gazer's next turn. While the target is charmed in this way, its 
speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls. 
2. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 
Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of the 
gazer's next turn. 
3. Frost Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 
Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) cold damage. 
4. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature that is Medium or 
smaller, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or 
be moved up to 30 feet directly away from the gazer. 
If the target is an object weighing 10 pounds or less that 
isn't being worn or carried, the gazer moves it up to 30 feet in 
any direction. The gazer can also exert fine control on objects 
with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a 
container.
