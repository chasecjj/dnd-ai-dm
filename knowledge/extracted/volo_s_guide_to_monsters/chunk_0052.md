A powerful sea hag might have the following additional 
lair actions: 
• The hag fills up to four 10-foot cubes of water with ink. 
The inky areas are heavily obscured for 1 minute, al-
though a steady, strong underwater current disperses 
the ink on initiative count 10. The hag ignores the ob-
scuring effect of the ink. 
• The hag chooses one humanoid within the lair and 
instantly creates a simulacrum of that creature (as if 
created with the simulacrum spell). This hideous sim-
ulacrum is formed out of seaweed, slime, half-eaten 
fish, and other garbage, but still generally resembles 
the creature it is jmitating. This simulacrum obeys the 
hag's commands and is destroyed on initiative count 
20 on the next round. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
A hag's foul nature slowly suffuses the environment 
around her lair, twisting it to evil. 
Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional 
effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven 
has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including 
some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional 
effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw 
uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. 
These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or 
abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.

REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is 
warped by the creature's fell magic, which creates one 
or more of the following effects: 
• Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some 
other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in 
great profusion. 
• Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower 
are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive 
toward intruders in the area. 
• Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls 
magically appear in trees. 
A powerful annis hag creates one or more of the follow-
ing additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair: 
• The gravel stones on a safe-looking path, road, 
or trails occasionally become sharp for 100-foot 
intervals. Walking on these areas is like walking 
on caltrops. 
, Small avalanches of rock intermittently fall, blocking 
a path or burying intruders. A buried creature is re-
strained and has to hold its breath until it is dug out. 
• Strange laughter, sounding like that of children or the 
hag herself, occasionally pierces the silence. 
• Small cairns appear along the route of travelers, con-
taining anything from mysterious bones to nothing at 
all. These cairns might be haunted by skeletons, spec-
ters, or hostile fey.

A powerful bheur hag creates one or more of the follow-
ing additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair: 
• Small avalanches of snow intermittently fall, blocking 
a path or burying intruders. A buried creature is re-
strained and has to hold its breath until it is dug out. 
Human-sized blocks of ice appear, containing frozen 
corpses. These corpses might break free and attack 
as zombies, or their spirits might attack as specters. 
• Blizzards come without warning. A blizzard occurs 
once every 2d12 hours and lasts ld3 hours. During a 
storm, creatures moving overland travel at half nor-
mal speed, and normal visibility is reduced to 30 feet. 
• Roads, paths, and trails twist and turn back on them-
selves, making navigation in the area exceedingly 
difficult. 
A powerful green hag creates one or more of the follow-
ing additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair: 
• Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places 
at random times (but never more than one in any given 
location). An illusory duplicate has no substance, but 
it looks, sounds, and moves like the hag. The hag can 
sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet 
of her duplicate and can interact with them as if she 
were present and standing in the duplicate's space. If 
the illusory duplicate takes any damage, it disappears. 
• The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, 
since the plants grow thick and twjsted, and the 
swamps are thick with reeking mud. 
• Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when 
hostile intruders are near. 
A powerful night hag creates one or more of the follow-
ing additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair: 
• Shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes 
move on their own as though alive. 
• Creatures are transported to a harmless but eerie 
demiplane filled with shadowy forms, waxy corpses, 
and cackling. The creatures are trapped there for a 
minute or two, and then returned to the place where 
they vanished from. 
• Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of dead 
friends, family members, and even themselves litter-
ing the hag's realm. Any attempt to interact with a 
hallucinatory image causes it to disappear. 
A powerful sea hag creates one or more of the following 
additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair: 
• Most surfaces are covered by a thin film of slime, 
which is slick and sticks to anything that touches it. 
• Currents and tides are exceptionally strong and 
treacherous. Any ability check made to safely navigate 
or control a vessel moving through these waters has 
disadvantage. 
• Shores are littered with dead, rotting fish. The hag 
can sense when one of the fish is handled and cause it 
to speak with her voice. 
MINIONS AND PETS 
Although they are solitary by nature, hags sometimes 
feel the need for companionship. Usually one scratches 
this itch by acquiring servants she can insult and

slap around as she wishes. Such a creature might be 
charmed into compliance, or under a spell that stops 
its heart if it disobeys, or too afraid of nonmagical pun-
ishment for failure to do what she says. Most hags have 
some kind of slave or minion creature living with or 
near them as a defense against attackers, even if it's just 
a common animal. 
Hags particularly delight in using mortals bound 
to their service as minions. A paladin might have no 
qualms about putting a hag coven to the sword, but 
her conviction falters if she must first fight through a 
crowd of innocent farmers that the hag has compelled 
to defend her. Ordinary folk are also useful as minions 
because they can serve the hag as her eyes and ears in 
a nearby settlement, either operating secretly or actively 
trying to persuade other townsfolk to pay her a visit. 
The weird magic at a hag's disposal means that she 
might have almost any type of creature helping or serv-
ing her-fey, giant, undead, and so on. Even a creature 
much more powerful than she might be under her 
command, working off the debt of a bargain for itself or 
someone else. Favors beget favors, and under duress a 
hag might speak a magic word to call upon a blood debt 
from a dragon, a noble, or another hag, making her able 
to wield magical. political, or physical power in a way 
she can't do by herself. 
Like the land near a hag's lair, over time her minions 
are altered by her presence, becoming twisted versions 
of their former selves (in a dark fey sort of way), but still 
recognizable as what they once were. She might alter 
them with magic, making them tireless, resistant to fire, 
able to transform into a flock of crows, or able to teleport 
through shadows-whatever the hag thinks best defends 
or serves her. 
RANDOM HAG MINIONS 
To determine the minions and helpers in a hag's retinue, 
roll once on the following tables or choose from the pos-
sibilities. 
The Servants table includes faithful, trusted helpers 
that a hag uses to protect herself and her home. These 
creatures are either naturally wicked or warped by the 
hag to better serve her. In either case, a hag is confident 
that her servants will obey her orders without question. 
The Brutes table gives examples of the muscle a hag 
might employ, mercenaries that serve the hag only so 
long as it benefits them. These creatures run errands 
and take care of roughing up enemies or patrolling 
areas that the hag considers beneath her personal atten-
tion. Hags prefer to employ clever, cruel creatures rather 
than dumb oafs.
