double as a school and training facility for spellcasters. 
If a hobgoblin lair has a prison, it's usually a small one-
miscreants are incarcerated for only a short time before 
facing the hobgoblins' harsh justice. 
MAGLUBIYET'S WILL BE DONE 
When Maglubiyet conquered the goblins' gods, he taught 
the goblins to fear his cruelty. They bowed in sniveling 
obeisance to him and then turned their impotent wrath 
upon others, becoming petty tyrants. When Maglubiyet 
conquered the bugbears' gods, he taught the bugbears 
the practicality of cold brutality. When Maglubiyet con-
quered the hobgoblins' gods, he knew he had to take the 
hobgoblins firmly in hand. From him they learned disci-
pline, and thus they became the natural leaders among 
all the goblinoids. 
The goblinoids are bound together by Maglubiyet's 
subjugation of their individual deities. All types rightly 
fear Maglubiyet's wrath, but each carries out the Mighty 
One's divine will differently. Goblins typically flee from 
obvious threats, and hobgoblins often have to round up 
and threaten them before they can make use of them. 
Bugbears accept hobgoblin demands for assistance only 
grudgingly, and often they must be bribed with loot, spir-
its, battle gear, or the severed heads of enemy leaders- a 
particularly holy gift. Hobgoblins operating on their own 
will remain in their forts, content to deal with internal 
politics of rank and matters of defense, but when they 
encounter other types of goblinoids (or seek them out), it 
is viewed by all as a divine sign- Maglubiyet has called 
them together to do his bidding on a grand scale. 
CALL TO WAR: FORMATION OF THE HOST 
When the three types of goblinoids coalesce into a host, 
this new societal and military arrangement fundamen-
tally changes how virtually every individual behaves. 
Leaders in Word and Deed. Hobgoblins form the 
backbone of the new culture, taking up most leadership 
roles and acting as the strong center in any military 
action. Hobgoblins that are called to lead a host become 
fired with purpose, overtaken by a fanaticism that lends 
new urgency to their every action. 
When multiple legions gather into a host, each of 
those legions has a separate status, just as each banner 
in a legion does. The legion of the host's warlord has the 
No OTHER Goo SHALL STAND 
Goblinoids are indoctrinated from a young age to consider 
all gods but their own as lesser, false entities. Maglubiyet 
is the only true deity, they learn, and the world will be 
wracked by chaos and despair until he one day conquers 
all pantheons. Goblinoids harbor a special hatred for 
clerics of enemy deities, focusing on them in battle and 
desecrating their temples whenever they have the chance. 
Whether a deity is good, evil, or neutral is immaterial. All 
gods other than Maglubiyet and his servants are false and 
must be destroyed.

highest status, and warlords of lower status are demoted 
to the title of general. A member of the lowest-ranked 
banner in the warlord's legion has a higher status than 
those of other legions who share the same rank, but a 
general at the head of another legion still outranks ev-
eryone in the warlord's legion except for the warlord. 
Hobgoblins in a legion set aside their animosity for 
other legions when· a host forms. The warlords of rival 
legions don't seek to depose the leader of the host un-
less the fortunes of war create the opportunity. Each 
legion records all the insults directed toward it while a 
member of a host, and when the host disbands, those 
grudges again come to the forefront. 
Stealthy Shock Troops. Bugbears that are subsumed 
into a host function as a special cadre of spies, assas-
sins, and bodyguards, answering to the senior leader-
ship of the host rather than to others of their own kind. 
On occasion, their hobgoblin leaders will see fit to 
equip the bugbear force with improved equipment, such 
as metal-tipped javelins in place of stone-tipped ones, or 
chain shirts instead of the usual hide armor. Bugbears 
are never outfitted with ranged weapons (which they 
refuse to use) or with heavy armor (which compromises 
their stealthiness). 
If some bugbears demonstrate a particular talent 
for some facet of combat or subterfuge, the hobgob-
lins might separate them into squads that employ 
those skills to best effect (see the "Bugbear Special 
Forces" sidebar). 
Reluctant Little Tyrants. One of the first steps hob-
goblins take when a tribe of goblins joins the host is to 
train the gatherers and the pariahs as soldiers, effec-
tively elevating those goblins' status to that of hunters 
and reducing the number of castes in the host to two. 
Leaders and religious figures of the tribe still maintain 
some of their authority, but the lowliest hobgoblin or 
bugbear can give an order to a goblin chief, and that 
chief must leap to obey or, as is often the case, immedi-
ately yell orders for other goblins to do it. 
Goblins that are conscripted into a host resign them-
selves to their fate-which could well be to have their 
souls claimed by Maglubiyet for eternal war in Acheron. 
Thus reconciled, they become humorless and show no 
pity toward whatever meager victims fall under their 
dominion, usually enslaved laborers or monsters that 
are pressed into service as battle beasts. When the need 
arises, they also work as scouts, sappers during sieges, 
and skirmishers on the battlefront. 
Auxiliary Units. A host rarely consists of nothing but 
goblinoids, especially if it has been on the move for a 
while. In addition to wolf and worg mounts and flocks 
of squawking ravens, a host might attract or press into 
service many kinds of creatures. Some possibilities: 
• A low, two-wheeled pushcart loaded with small 
wooden cages containing cockatrices. 
• A hydra with goblins riding on each head that direct 
the beast by controlling the view of its blinkered eyes. 
• Former slaves, often soldiers who once fought against 
the host, who now fight alongside the host to gain bet-
ter treatment and protect loved ones held captive. 
Hob&oblin, have a code ol honor. Ita detail, vary 
uom le&ion to le&ion, but it's alway, brutal.

• A carrion crawler ridden by several goblins in a row 
and directed by a lead goblin using a long pole to sus-
pend a lantern just out of reach of its tentacles. 
THE HOST ON THE MARCH 
A goblinoid host that is prepared for war doesn't wait for 
the enemy to approach its doorstep. In pursuit of ever 
greater glory for Maglubiyet, the host's leaders keep the 
army on the move, occasionally breaking off small gar-
risons (often of one type of goblinoid) to guard territory 
that needs to be held. 
A host usually marches at night, with outriders, 
who carry messenger ravens, traveling ahead, behind, 
and on both sides of the main group. The ravens can 
distinguish between individuals from a great height 
and navigate over long distances. Thus, a raven can fly 
back to the main body when it is released by someone 
remote from the group, and it can be sent out again to 
look for the individual that released it in order to deliver 
a response. 
Most of the army travels on foot, and wolf-riding gob-
lins and worg-riding hobgoblins also make up a signifi-
cant portion of the force. Hobgoblins might ride horses 
or other mounts they could obtain, such as hippogriffs, 
axe beaks, or giant vultures. Bugbears don't ride 
mounts, but they aren't above hitching a ride in the how-
dah of an enormous battle beast such as an elephant 
or a hydra. 
BUGBEAR SPECIAL FORCES 
Under any circumstances, bugbears are valued members 
of a goblinoid host. If some of them are specialized (or 
can be trained) in different aspects of warfare, their value 
increases, especially when they work in concert. 
Thugs. Bugbears that serve as thugs have more ofHrug-
gek than Grankhul in them. They leap in among massed 
foes and make wide, whirling swings with their weapons to 
create openings in enemy formations. 
Bulwarks. The wild attack of a group of thugs is often 
followed by the charge of one or more bulwarks. A bugbear 
bulwark carries a spiked shield into battle that it uses like a 
plow, bashing aside whatever it encounters. 
Murderers. Bugbears that are gifted in stealth are sent 
out to kill enemy sentries and thus clear the way for others 
to penetrate the foe's defenses. Murderers carry many jav-
elins with them, which they throw from hiding and wield 
in melee, and they also carry garrotes to cut off sounds of 
screaming.
