Tlincallis, also called scorpion folk, are chitin-covered 
creatures, humanoid from the waist up with the lower 
body of an enormous scorpion, complete with a stinger 
at the end of a long tail. 
Desert Nomads. Tlincallis live austerely. They 
range across arid lands, hunting at dawn and dusk. In 
the hours between, they wait out the day's heat or the 
night's cold by burying themselves in loose sand or 
earth or, if the terrain proves too inflexible, lurking in 
ruins or shallow caves. A tribe of tlincallis stays in one 
place for only as long as the hunting is good in the im-
mediate area, though they might visit the same way sta-
tions over and over during their wanderings. The tribe 
also settles down temporarily whenever it's time to lay 
eggs and hatch a new brood of young. 
Poisonous 13Us. Tlincallis deposit their eggs in warm 
places out of direct sunlight, often amid a stand of cacti 
near their present encampment. There the eggs lie pro-
tected by hard shells coated in paralytic poison similar 
to that produced by their stingers. A would-be predator 
that dares to break an egg is defenseless against the 
tlincallis that come to investigate. 
Horrid Kidnappers. Tlincallis eat what they kill, 
but they also take some of their prey alive when they 
have new mouths to feed. After using their stingers to 
paralyze victims and their spiked chains to bind them, 
tlincallis take these prisoners back to their encampment 
and tie them to cactus or rock formations. There, vic-
tims wait until the sun sets and the newly hatched young 
emerge from the lair to eat them alive. 
Prideful Hunters. Tlincallis see themselves as great 
hunters. If a tlincalli tribe encounters a more powerful 
hunter, such as a blue dragon, the tribe's leader must 
decide whether the group becomes obedient to the supe-
rior hunter, moves on, or fights to the death to defeat it. 
Makeshift Weapons and Ofvects. Tlincallis are un-
civilized and don't build cities, make clothing, or mine 
metals. Instead, they scavenge what they need or want. 
They do, however, know how to melt down scavenged 
metal to forge crude weapons and tools.

Multiattack. The tlincalli makes two attacks: one with its long-
sword or spiked chain, and one with its sting. 
Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach S ft., one tar-
get. Hii: 7 (ld8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (ldlO + 3) slashing 
damage if used with two hands. 
Spiked Chain. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hii: 6 (ld6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target is grap-
pled (escape DC 11) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until 
this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tlincalli can't 
use the spiked chain against another target. 
Sting. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, 
and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving 
throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If it fails the saving throw by 
5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned. The tar-
get can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success.
