written notes or signs. Gnolls simply wander, attack, 
kill, and feed. Anything more sophisticated is beyond 
the band's concern. 
ROLEPLAYING GNOLLS AND 
CULTISTS OF YEENOGHU 
Gnolls have little variation in personality and outlook. 
They are collectively an elemental force, driven by a de-
mon lord to spread death and destruction. 
The only real opportunity for interaction with gnolls 
is provided by the cultists that sometimes accompany 
a war band. This humanoid rabble might have informa-
tion the characters need or could even be former friends 
corrupted to the worship ofYeenoghu. To portray a gnoll 
that is more intelligent or social than the usual, you can 
give it characteristics similar to Yeenoghu cultists.

GNOLLNAMES 
As befits creatures with a language that is little more 
than whines, growls, and shrieks, most gnolls lack a 
name and would have little use for one. Powerful gnolls, 
usually fangs, pack lords, and flinds, receive names di-
rectly from Yeenoghu. The same applies to Yeenoghu's 
blessed followers among humans, ores, and other races.

ANATOMY OF A WAR BAND 
A gnoll war band is likely to contain a variety of gnolls 
and other creatures, and no two of these groups have 
the same composition. 
The gnolls that make up the rank and file have differ-
ent attributes and thus different roles in the war band's 
assaults. Augmenting the warriors that comprise the 
bulk of the force are the hunters, specialists in sneaking 
and attacking at range, and the flesh gnawers, which 
rely on natural savagery rather than weapons to tear 
apart their foes. A pack of hyenas is always part of the 
band, and sometimes these beasts are as numerous 
as the gnolls themselves. A war band that has been 
through hard times might contain a number of gnoll 
witherlings, while one that enjoys Yeenoghu's favor 
might be led by a flind-the scarcest and strongest of 
all goolls. It's also possible, though quite rare, for a war
