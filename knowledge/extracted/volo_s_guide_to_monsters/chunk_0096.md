With their foes banished to the deepest reaches of the 
sea, tritons settled in to watch for any sign of their re-
turn. Over time, the tritons extended their stewardship 
over the sea floor from their initial settlements and built 
outposts to create trade with other races. Despite this 
expansion, few folk know of them. Their settlements 
are so remote even merfolk and sea elves rarely en-
counter them. 
HAUGHTY NOBLES 
As a result of their isolation and limited understand-
ing of the Material Plane, tritons can come across as 
haughty and arrogant. They see themselves as caretak-
ers of the sea, and they expect other creatures to pay 
them deep respect, if not complete deference. 
This attitude might grate on others, but it arises from 
a seed of truth. Few know of the tritons' great victories 
over dreadful undersea threats. The tritons make little 
allowance for such ignorance and are delighted to ex-
pound upon the great debt others owe them. 
Tritons also have a tendency to emerge from their iso-
lation under the assumption that other folk will welcome 
them as respected allies and mentors. Again, distance 
drives much of this attitude. The tritons' limited view of 
the world leaves them ignorant of the kingdoms, wars, 
and other struggles of the surface world. Tritons readily 
see such concerns as minor events, a sideshow to the 
tritons' role as the world's true protectors. 
STAUNCH CHAMPIONS 
Despite their off-putting manners, tritons are benevolent 
creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races 
deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but 
when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a kraken awakens 
from its slumber, they are among the first to take up 
arms to protect others. 
Tritons readily sacrifice themselves for the common 
good. They will fight and die for humans, merfolk, and 
other creatures without question. Their self-absorbed 
nature makes them overlook the history of other crea-
tures, but they also endure a sense of guilt over allowing 
the evils of the Plane of Water to enter the Material 
Plane and threaten its inhabitants. The tritons believe 
they owe a debt of honor to the world, and they will fight 
and die to pay it. 
At times their fervor and ignorance of the world can 
lead them astray. Tritons encountering other creatures 
for the first time can underestimate them, leaving the 
tritons vulnerable to deception. With their strong mar-
tial tradition, tritons can sometimes be too eager to leap 
into a fight. 
STRANGERS TO THE SURFACE 
Given their isolation, most tritons have never been to 
the surface world. They struggle with the idea that they 
can't easily move up and down out of water, and the 
changing of the seasons mystifies them. 
SPELL: WALL OF WATER 
3rd-level evocation 
Casting Time: l action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a drop of water) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
You conjure up a wall of water on the ground at a point 
you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 
feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make 
a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 
1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The 
wall's space is difficult terrain. 
Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space 
has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is 
halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its 
target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the 
wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze 
solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen). Each 
5-foot-square frozen section has AC S and 1 S hit points. 
Reducing a frozen section to O hit points destroys it. When 
a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.
