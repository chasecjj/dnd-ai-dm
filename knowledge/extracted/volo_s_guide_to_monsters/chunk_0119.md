FLAIL SNAIL 
A flail snail is a creature of elemental earth that is 
prized for its multihued shell. Hunters might be lulled 
into a false sense of confidence upon sighting this pon-
derous, seemingly nonhostile creature. If any other crea-
ture large enough to be a threat approaches too close, 
though, the snail unleashes a flash of scintillating light 
and then attacks with its mace-like tentacles. 
Trail o[Treasure, Left undisturbed, a flail snail 
moves slowly along the ground, consuming everything 
on the surface, including rocks, sand, and soil, stopping 
to relish crystal growths and other large mineral de-
posits. It leaves behind a shimmering trail that quickly 
solidifies into a thin layer of a nearly transparent sub-
stance inedible to the snail. This glassy residue can 
be harvested and cut to form window panes of varying 
clearness. It can also be heated and spun into glass 
objects of other sorts. Some humanoids make a living 
from trailing flail snails to collect this glass. 
USING THE SHELL OF A FLAIL SNAIL 
A flail snail shell, which weighs about 250 pounds, has nu-
merous uses. One intact shell can sell for 5,000 gp. 
Many hunters seek the shell for its antimagic properties. 
A skilled armorer can make three shields from one shell. 
For l month, each shield gives its wielder the snail's Anti-
magic Shell trait. When the shield's magic fades, it leaves 
behind an exotic shield that is the perfect item from which 
to make a spel/guard shield. 
A flail snail shell can also be used to make a robe of scin-
tillating colors. The shell is ground and added to the dye 
while the garment is being fashioned. The powder is also a 
material component of the ritual that enchants the robe.

Antimagic Shell. The snail has advantage on saving throws 
against spells, and any creature making a spell attack against 
the snail has disadvantage on the attack roll. If the snail 
succeeds on its saving throw against a spell or a spell attack 
misses it, an additional effect might occur, as determined by 
rolling a dG: 
7-2. If the spell affects an area or has multiple targets, it fails 
and has no effect. If the spell targets only the snail, it has no 
effect on the snail and is reflected back at the caster, using the 
spell slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting 
ability of the caster. 
3-4. No additional effect. 
5-6. The snail's shell converts some of the spell's energy into 
a burst of destructive force. Each creature within 30 feet of the 
snail must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking ld6 
force damage per level of the spell on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 
Flail Tentacles. The flail snail has five flail tentacles. Whenever 
the snail•takes 10 damage or more on a single turn, one of its 
tentacles dies. If even one tentacle remains, the snail regrows 
all dead ones within ld4 days. If all its tentacles die, the snail 
retracts into its shell, gaining total cover, and it begins wailing, 
a sound that can be heard for 600 feet, stopping only when it 
dies 5d6 minutes later. Healing magic that restores limbs, such 
as the regenerate spell, can halt this dying process. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The flail snail makes as many Flail Tentacle at-
tacks as it has flail tentacles, all against the same target. 
Flail Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hit: 6 (ld6 + 3} bludgeoning damage. 
Scintillating Shell (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The 
snail's shell emits dazzling, colored light until the end of the 
snail's next turn. During this time, the shell sheds bright light 
in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and 
creatures that can see the snail have disadvantage on attack 
rolls against it. In addition, any creature within the bright light 
and able to see the snail when this power is activated must 
succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until 
the light ends. 
Shell Defense. The flail snail withdraws into its shell, gaining a 
+4 bonus to AC until it emerges. It can emerge from its shell as 
a bonus action on its turn.
