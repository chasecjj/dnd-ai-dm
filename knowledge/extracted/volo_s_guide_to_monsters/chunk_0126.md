giant disperses it (no action required), and it can't be 
dispersed by wind. 
• The giant creates a 60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line of 
strong wind (or strong current within water) originat-
ing from a point anywhere in its lair. Each creature 
in that line must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving 
throw or be pushed 15 feet in the direction the wind 
is blowing. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it 
extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unpro-
tected flames in its area. Protected flames, such as 
those of lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being 
extinguished. 
Regional Effects. The region containing a storm giant 
quintessent's lair is warped by the giant's presence, 
which creates one or more of the following effects: 
• High wind blows within 1 mile of the lair, making it 
impossible to light a fire unless the location where the 
fire is lit is protected from the wind. 
• Rain, snow, or blowing dust or sand (whichever is 
most appropriate) is constant within 1 mile of the lair. 
Rain causes rivers and streams to fill or overflow their 
banks; snow, dust, or sand form deep drifts or dunes. 
• Flashes of lightning and peals of thunder are contin-
ual, day and night, within 5 miles of the lair. 
If the giant dies, the lightning, thunder, and high wind 
regional effects end immediately. Rain, snow, and blow-
ing dust abate gradually within ld8 days.

Amphibious. The giant can breathe air and water. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The giant makes two Lightning Sword attacks or 
uses Wind Javelin twice. 
Lightning Sword. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., 
one target. Hit: 40 (9d6 + 9) lightning damage. 
Wind javelin. The giant coalesces wind into a javelin-like form 
and hurls it at a creature it can see within 600 feet of it. The 
javetin is considered a magic weapon and deals 19 (3d6 + 9) 
piercing damage to the target, striking unerringly. The javelin 
disappears after it hits. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The giant can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the op-
tions below. Only one legendary action option can be used at 
a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The giant 
regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. 
Gust. The giant targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it 
and creates a magical gust of wind around it. The target must 
succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up 
to 20 feet in any horizontal direction the giant chooses. 
Thunderbolt (2 Actions). The giant hurls a thunderbolt at a 
creature it can see within 600 feet of it. The target must make 
a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) thunder 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a suc-
cessful one. 
One with the Storm (3 Actions). The giant vanishes, dispersing 
itself into the storm surrounding its lair. The giant can end 
this effect at the start of any of its turns, becoming a giant 
once more and appearing in any location it chooses within 
its lair. While dispersed, the giant can't take any actions other 
than lair actions, and it can't be targeted by attacks, spells, or 
other effects. The giant can't use this ability outside its lair, 
nor can it use this ability if another creature is using a control 
weaiher spell or similar magic to quell the storm.
