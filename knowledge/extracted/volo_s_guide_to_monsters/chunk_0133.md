BHEUR HAG 
Bheur hags live in wintry lands, favoring snow-covered 
mountains. They become more active during winter, us-
ing their ice and weather magic to make life miserable 
for nearby settlements. 
A bheur hag's skin is blue-white, like that of a person 
who has frozen to death. Her hair is pale white, and she 
is emaciated, as if she were a person who had survived 
winter by eating bark and leather. Her eyes are pale and 
surrounded by dark, bruise-colored flesh. A bheur car-
ries a twisted gray wooden staff, which she can ride like 
a flying broom and augments her magical powers. 
Cold Hearts. Bheur hags are attracted to selfish ac-
tions justified by deadly cold, such as murdering a trav-
eler for a winter coat, chopping down a dryad's grove for 
firewood, and so on. These actions are especially sweet 
to a bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedy 
merchant hoarding more food for the winter than he 
could possibly eat while others starve. Bheurs love to 
seed such ideas and thoughts in mortals. They use their 
ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with 
snow and freezing cold, hoping to instill despair that 
turns the villagers against each other. 
A bheur hag loves watching unprepared people suffer 
and die for their mistakes during the winter. She is de-
lighted when mortals make petty, pathetic attempts to 
survive, such as eating boots and leather scraps when 
no real food is to be found. 
Awful to Behold. When a bheur hag is fully in the 
throes of combat and has recently slain one of her foes, 
she often forgoes a direct attack on her remaining ene-
mies and instead takes a moment to feed on the corpse, 
dismembering it and tearing meat from bone. The sight 
of this savagery is enough to render witnesses temporar-
ily insane. 
Covens. A bheur hag that is part of a coven (see the 
"Hag Covens" sidebar in the Monster Manual) has a 
challenge rating of 9 (5,000 XP).

Graystaff Magic. The hag carries a graystaff, a length of gray 
wood that is a focus for her inner power. She can ride the staff 
as if it were a broom of flying. While holding the staff, she can 
cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these 
spells are marked with an asterisk). If the staff is lost or de-
stroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a 
day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff. 
Ice Walk. The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces with-
out needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult ter-
rain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost her extra moment. 
Innate Spellcasting. The hag's innate spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She 
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material 
components: 
At will: hold person,* ray of frost 
3/day each: cone of cold,* ice storm,* wall of ice* 
1/day each: control weather 
ACTIONS 
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one tar-
get. Hit: 10 (2d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (ld6) 
cold damage. 
Maddening Feast. The hag feasts on the corpse of one enemy 
within 5 feet of her that died within the past minute. Each crea-
ture of the hag's choice that is within 60 feet of her and able 
to see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
be frightened of her for l minute. While frightened in this way, 
a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, 
can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the OM controls the 
creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat 
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the 
effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is suc-
cessful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the 
hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.
