OLO HAS ENCOUNTERED MANY MONSTERS 
in his day, few as odious or as ornery as 
the ones described herein. This chapter 
takes several iconic D&D monsters and 
provides additional information about 
their origins, their dispositions and 
behaviors, and their lairs-above and 
beyond what is written in the Monster Manual. To give 
every monster such grand treatment would require too 
many pages to count, so we winnowed down the list to 
nine groups of creatures that have a lot going for them 
and tend to get used often in D&D campaigns: 
Beholders 
Goblinoids 
Mind flayers 
Giants 
Hags 
Ores 
Gnolls 
Kobolds 
Yuan-ti 
If you plunder this chapter for ideas and maps the 
next time you create an adventure or a villain, then this 
material has served its purpose. We hope that, as you 
explore each monster section, you'll come up with new 
ways to challenge and entertain your players, as well as 
find new things that you can borrow for your own D&D 
campaign. Let each entry spark your imagination! 
You might be wondering why certain monsters were 
chosen above others. Where are dragons and githyanki? 
What, no fiends or undead? We hope to tackle other 
monsters in other products over time. Until then, mind 
the kobolds hiding under the stairs, and beware of hags 
bearing strange gifts. 
BEHOLDERS: BAD DREAMS 
COME TRUE 
To those who would seek to conquer beholders or 
merely understand them, nearly everything about their 
quarry is unfathomable. These bizarre creatures are 
possessed of alien intelligence, inhuman forms of per-
ception, and the ability to shape reality through force 
of will-or even by their mere presence. Inside the 
comfortable confines of its subterranean lair, a beholder 
is nearly unassailable thanks to the combination of its 
peerless intellect and the brutal effects of its eye rays. 
Some of the behaviors and motivations that beholders 
exhibit are analogous to those of humans and other in-
telligent creatures. The difference is one of degree. For 
instance, where a prideful, confident human might be

cowed by a serious threat, the arrogance of a beholder 
knows no such bounds: it believes that it is superior to 
every other creature, even including other beholders. A 
human chess player becomes a master by honing the 
ability to look several moves ahead during a game-
which is still no match for what a beholder can accom-
plish with its superior intelligence and awareness. 
The mind of a beholder is powerful and versatile 
enough that it can envision literally any possibility, and 
it prepares accordingly, making it virtually impossible 
for any invaders to catch it unawares. This way of think-
ing could be interpreted as a form of paranoia- and 
if so, it would be the most extreme form imaginable. 
While a human tyrant might be rightfully paranoid 
about unperceived threats, a beholder is paranoid even 
though it perceives everything, because that attitude is 
the natural companion to eternal vigilance. 
Beholders are among the few creatures that can shape 
reality in their vicinity. In addition, beholders don't 
truly sleep when they rest. Instead, a beholder's mind 
remains semiconscious even as it dreams. As a result, 
on rare occasions when a beholder dreams of another 
beholder, the dream-reality becomes warped and takes 
on physical form, becoming another actual beholder. 
To call this process reproduction would be inaccurate, 
because in most cases the old and new beholders fight 
to the death- a fact for which the rest of the world 
is thankful. 
INHUMAN INTELLECT 
A beholder sees in all directions. It is always looking for 
concealed attackers. Even when it sleeps, its smaller 
eyes remain open, scanning its lair for threats. If a hu-
man acted this way, the constant vigilance and lack of 
truly peaceful rest would lead to a dangerous level of 
psychosis, but a beholder's mind accepts this attitude as 
normal and necessary- it is always alert to the possibil-
ity of assassination or betrayal by unknown threats that 
stand ready to pounce on the beholder the instant it lets 
its guard down. 
Complementing this ever-present, passive paranoia is 
the beholder's genius-level intelligence. Where another 
creature would ignore the occurrence of two seemingly 
unrelated events as merely coincidental, a beholder 
imagines multiple ways they could be related, finding 
or fabricating a pattern out of supposed or actual ran-
domness. By thinking of all these possibilities-however 
implausible they might be-and extrapolating its own 
actions in response, a beholder is truly prepared for any 
situation and has a strategy to counteract it. 
A beholder has plans on top of plans, even for the 
least likely circumstances. It doesn't matter if invading

adventurers arrive at its lair with summoned angel allies 
or enslaved demons, by breaking through the floor, by 
teleporting or riding dinosaurs, or girded with layers of 
magical defenses and armed with advanced weapons. In 
any case, the beholder's reaction is calculated, because 
it has thought about what it and its minions must do in 
response to every situation. 
DESPOTIC PERSPECTIVE 
A beholder believes it is superior to all other entities. 
Unintelligent foes are regarded as food or pets. An in-
telligent creature is seen as food or a potential minion. 
A beholder's true rivals are other beholders, for only 
another beholder has the intellect, power, and magic to 
threaten another of its kind. 
Most of a beholder's mental activity is devoted to 
unearthing plots against itself (real or imaginary), plan-
ning attacks against known rivals, and preparing its 
defenses against all possible threats. It considers itself 
the center of the world, in a narcissistic way; of course 
the clan of duergar moving into its territory is because a 
rival is trying to oust it, of course the gang of adventur-
ers in its lair were sent to kill it by a cowardly rival, and 
so on, because it is the perfect example of beholderness 
and all other creatures are jealous. 
A beholder's arrogance is a prominent aspect of its 
personality. Although it isn't inclined to brag of its su-
periority, especially in combat, it is dismissive of its 
opponents' efforts and insulting of their abilities and 
failures. An exceptional challenger can earn a measure 
of respect- enough that the beholder might be merciful 
and pacify the creature with a charm ray or a sleep ray 
instead of killing it outright. Of course, this mercy has 
a purpose; the defeated opponent is interrogated, subju-
gated, and offered a role in the beholder's retinue once 
its will is broken. A beholder might consider a group 
of skilled adventurers to be a valuable prize and use 
its abilities to capture them all for this purpose, giving 
them the opportunity to serve as guards, spies, or assas-
sins against a rival. Refusal means, at best, servitude as 
a charmed minion, and at worst, disintegration. 
BIRTH OF A BEHOLDER 
Beholders can produce others of their own kind, but the 
process has nothing to do with biology and everything to 
do with psychology. 
When a beholder sleeps, its body goes briefly dormant 
but its mind never stops working. The creature is fully 
aware, even though to an outside observer it might ap-
pear oblivious of its surroundings. Sometimes a behold-
er's dreams are dominated by images of itself or of other 
beholders (which might or might not actually exist). On 
extremely rare occasions when a beholder dreams of 
another beholder, the act creates a warp in reality- from 
which a new, fully formed beholder springs forth un-
bidden, seemingly having appeared out of thin air in a 
nearby space. This "offspring" might be a duplicate of 
the beholder that dreamed it into existence, or it could 
take the form of a different variety of beholder, such as a 
death kiss or a gazer (see "Beholder-Kin"). It might also 
be a truly unique creature, such as could be spawned
