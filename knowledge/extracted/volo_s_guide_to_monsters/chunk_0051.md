TREASURE, TREASURE EVERYWHERE 
A hag's home is cluttered with mundane items, caged 
creatures, oddities, objects that hint of a magical pur-
pose, preserved specimens, scraps of lore, and curiosi-
ties that have a supernatural origin but aren't inherently 
magical. For a selection of strange hag treasures, see 
the "One-of-a-Kind Objects" section later in this chapter. 
EXIT STRATEGY 
A hag always has an escape plan, in case ambitious 
do-gooders try to turn her home into her final resting 
place. If she is outmatched, or wants to vacate her lair 
quickly for some other reason, she uses a mix of her 
innate spellcasting, rare magic, guile, and the assistance 
of minions to get away. Most hags have three plans 
prepared: one for general threats and two others for spe-
cific likely scenarios, such as "They've set the house on 
fire" or "A necromancer with undead are attacking." 
If a hag is forced to resort to such measures, she im-
mediately begins to plot her retaliation against those 
that caused her to flee. Like a vampire or a demon, a hag 
has a long life over which to exact her vengeance, and no 
dish of revenge is sweeter than one served cold and to 
the next three generations of her enemy's family. 
HAG LAIR ACTIONS 
If a hag is a grandmother, she gains a set of lair actions 
appropriate to her nature, knowledge; and history. A co-
ven that includes a grandmother can use her lair actions 
as well, but the grandmother's will prevails-if one of 
the coven attempts this sort of action and the grand-
mother disapproves, nothing happens. A powerful aun-
tie (or her coven) might also have access to lair actions 
like these, but only at certain times of the year or when 
the influence of the Feywild is strong. 
The following lair actions are options for grand-
mothers and powerful aunties. Grandmothers usually 
have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one 
(if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair 
action that requires a creature to make a saving throw 
uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can 
take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, 
but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
• Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag 
can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and 
floors as if the surfaces weren't there. 
• The hag targets any number of doors and windows 
that she can see, causing each one to either open 
or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magi-
cally locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength 
check to force open) until she chooses to make them 
unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to 
open them. 
A powerful annis hag might have the following addi-
tional lair action: 
• The hag creates a thick cloud of caustic black smoke 
that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point 
she can see within 120 feet her. The cloud lasts un-

til initiative count 20 on the next round. Creatures 
and objects in or behind the smoke are heavily ob-
scured. A creature that enters the cloud for the first 
time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (3d6) 
acid damage. 
A powerful bheur hag might have the following addi-
tional lair action: 
• The hag creates a blizzard in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot 
radius cylinder centered on a point she can see within 
120 feet of her. The effect lasts until initiative count 
20 on the next round. The blizzard lightly obscures 
every creature and object in the area for the duration. 
A creature that enters the blizzard for the first time on 
a tum or starts its turn there is blinded until initiative 
count 20 on the next round. 
A powerful green hag might have the following addi-
tional lair action: 
• The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which 
appears in its own space. As long as she can see her 
duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal to her 
walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on 
her turn (no action required). The illusion has the 
same statistics as the hag but can't take actions or re-
actions. It can interact with its environment and even 
pick up and hold real objects. The illusion seems real 
in every way but disappears if it takes any amount of 
damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses 
it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the 
hag uses this lair action to create a new duplicate, the 
previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects in its 
possession. 
A powerful night hag might have the following addi-
tional lair actions: 
• One creature the hag can see within 120 feet of her 
must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or 
be banished to a prison demiplane. To escape, the 
creature must use its action to make a Charisma 
check contested by the hag's. If the creature wins, it 
escapes the demiplane. Otherwise, the effect ends on 
initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect 
ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in 
the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied. 
• The hag targets up to three creatures that she can see 
within 60 feet of her. Each target must succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be flung up to 30 
feet through the air. A creature that strikes a solid 
object or is released in midair takes ld6 bludgeoning 
damage for every 10 feet moved or fallen.
