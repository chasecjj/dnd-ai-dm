priests might have to meditate for hours or days to get a 
vision of its meaning. 
Every group of ores has particular superstitions and 
recognizes certain omens. These tenets vary from tribe 
to tribe, and are often based in events that the tribe has 
experienced. Here are a few examples: 
• If a dwarf or a human invokes its god upon dying, you 
must carry the corpse's ears for three days to ward off 
any retribution, and then bury or burn them. 
• Three ravens is always a good sign. 
• It is good luck to spit where you are about to sleep. 
• Gnome bones can ward off diseases if they are worn. 
• Don't stand inside a ring of stones, mushrooms, or any 
other kind of circle. 
• Seeing a shooting star before a battle is bad luck. To 
ward it off, you must swallow a stone. 
• A tribute of elf ears brings favor from Gruumsh. 
• If you bury five stones at dawn before a long journey, 
you will always find your way back to the war hearth. 
• Stomping your foot three times and uttering 
"Gruumsh" wards off bad magic. 
SYMBOLIC COMMUNICATION 
Ores have a written language adapted from that of the 
dwarves, but they aren't a literate culture and rarely 
keep records or write down their thoughts. When ores 
need to communicate in writing, they use crude symbols 
to convey basic information, such as "food stored here," 
•danger close," or "go this way." A ore raiding party 
might leave such a sign in its wake, as an aid to other 
warriors that travel through the same area later on. 
Mountain guides, druids, and rangers might be famil-
iar with many of these symbols, enabling them to keep 
their charges from inadvertently stumbling into a tribe's 
territory. 
0RCS AS UNDERLINGS 
With their culturally ingrained tendency to bow before su-
perior strength, ores can be subjugated by a powerful and 
charismatic individual. Evil human spellcasters and rulers 
in particular have a penchant for enslaving or deceiving 
ores into service. A leader backed by a great military force 
could swoop down upon a tribe, kill its leaders, and cow 
the rest of the ores into submission. 
A spellcaster typically takes a more devious approach, 
using magic to conjure up false omens that strike fear into 
the tribe and make it obedient. A wizard might manipulate 
a few of the ores that rank just below the war chief, using 
them as pawns to help overthrow the leader. The wizard 
validates the change in command with signs supposedly 
delivered by the gods (which are in truth nothing but a few 
well-cast illusions), and turns the tribe into a strike force 
eager to do the bidding of its new chief. 
The survivors of a tribe scattered by defeat sometimes 
fall back on their fighting skills to find employment, indi-
vidually or in small groups, with whoever is willing to hire 
them. These mercenaries, while they might pride them-
selves on their seeming independence, nevertheless strive 
to follow through on their end of a bargain, because being 
paid by one's employer is better than being hunted down 
for breaking a deal.

COLORS OF CONQUEST 
Three colors have special meaning to all ores, and they 
adorn their bodies, possessions, and lairs with pigments 
that produce those hues. Red ochre is used to represent 
blood, grayish-white ash to represent death, and char-
coal to represent darkness. 
The unwritten laws that govern the status of individ-
ual ores within a tribe are manifested to a degree in 
how each ore uses these colors on itself and its personal 
items. For instance, the chief of one tribe might be the 
only one that has the right to stain its tusks with red 
ochre, while the warriors of another tribe rub streaks 
of ash into their garments to signify their safe return 
from a raid. 
ROLEPLAYING AN 0RC 
Most ores have been indoctrinated into a life of destruc-
tion and slaughter. But unlike creatures who by their 
very nature are evil, such as gnolls, it's possible that an 
ore, if raised outside its culture, could develop a limited 
capacity for empathy, love, and compassion. 
No matter how domesticated an ore might seem, 
its blood lust flows just beneath the surface. With its 
instinctive love of battle and its desire to prove its 
strength, an ore trying to live within the confines of civi-
lization is faced with a difficult task.
