CHAMPION 
Champions are mighty warriors who honed their fight-
ing skills in wars or gladiatorial pits. To soldiers and 
other people who fight for a living, champions are as 
influential as nobles, and their presence is courted as a 
sign of status among rulers. 
CONJURER 
Conjurers are specialist wizards who summon crea-
tures from other planes and create materials out of thin 
air. Some conjurers use their magic to bolster armies or 
destroy enemies on battlefields, while others use sum-
moned creatures to guard their lairs.
