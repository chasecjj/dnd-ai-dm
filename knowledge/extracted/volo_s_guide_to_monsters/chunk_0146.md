REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The territory within 5 miles of an elder brain is altered 
by the creature's psionic presence, which creates one or 
more of the following effects: 
• Creatures within 5 miles of an elder brain feel as if 
they are being followed, even when they are not. 
• The elder brain can overhear any telepathic conver-
sation happening within 5 miles of it. The creature 
that initiated the telepathic conversation makes a DC 
18 Wisdom (Insight) check when telepathic contact is 
first established. If the check succeeds, the creature is

Creature Sense. The elder brain is aware of the presence of 
creatures within 5 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 
4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each crea-
ture, as well as each one's Intelligence score, but can't sense 
anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank 
spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived 
in this manner. 
Innate Spel/casting (Psionics). The elder brain's innate spell-
casting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18). It can innately 
cast the following spells, requiring no components: 
At will: detect thoughts, levitate 
1/day each: dominate monster, plane shift (self only} 
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the elder brain fails a saving 
throw, it can choose to succeed instead. 
Magic Resistance. The elder brain has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. 
Telepathic Hub. The elder brain can use its telepathy to initiate 
and maintain telepathic conversations with up to ten creatures 
at a time. The elder brain can let those creatures telepathically 
hear each other while connected in this way. 
A CTIONS 
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. 
Hit: 20 (4d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or 
smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and takes 9 (ld8 
+ 5) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until the 
grapple ends. The elder brain can have up to four targets grap-
pled at a time. 
aware that something is eavesdropping on the conver-
sation. The nature of the eavesdropper isn't revealed, 
and the elder brain can't participate in the telepathic 
conversation unless it has formed a psychic link with 
the creature that initiated it. 
• Any creature with which the elder brain has formed a 
psychic link hears faint, incomprehensible whispers in 
the deepest recesses of its mind. This psychic detritus 
consists of the elder brain's stray thoughts commin-
gled with those of other creatures to which it is linked. 
If the elder brain dies, these effects immediately end. 
Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The elder brain magically emits 
psychic energy. Creatures of the elder brain's choice within 60 
feet ofit must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or 
take 32 (5dl0 + 5) psychic damage and be stunned for l min-
ute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of 
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
Psychic Link. The elder brain targets one incapacitated creature 
it can perceive with its Creature Sense trait and establis~es a 
psychic link with that creature. Until the psychic link ends, the 
elder brain can perceive everything the target senses. T~e tar-
get becomes aware that something is linked to its mind once 
it is no longer incapacitated, and the elder brain can terminate 
the link at any time (no action required). The target can. use an 
action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so 
with a successful DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a success-
ful save, the target takes 10 (3d6} psychic damage. The psychic 
link also ends if the target and the elder brain are more than 
5 miles apart, with no consequences to the target. The elder 
brain can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time. 
Sense Thoughts. The elder brain targets a creature with which it 
has a psychic link. The elder brain gains insight into the target's 
reasoning, its emotional state, and thoughts that loom large in 
its mind (including things the target worries about, loves, or 
hates). The elder brain can also make a Charisma (Deception} 
check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking 
it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target 
contests this attempt with a Wisdom (Insight} check. If the el-
der brain succeeds, the mind believes the deception for l hour 
or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The elder brain can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from 
the options below. It can take only one legendary action at a 
time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The elder 
brain regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. 
Tentacle. The elder brain makes a tentacle attack. 
Break Concentration. The elder brain targets a creature within 
120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain 
breaks the creature's concentration on a spell it has cast. The 
creature also takes ld4 psychic damage per level of the spell. 
Psychic Pulse. The elder brain targets a creature within 120 
feet of it with which it has a psychic link. Enemies of the 
elder brain within 10 feet of that creature take 10 (3d6} psy-
chic damage. 
Sever Psychic Link. The elder brain targets a creature within 
120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain 
ends the link, causing the creature to have disadvantage on 
all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the end 
of the creature's next turn.
