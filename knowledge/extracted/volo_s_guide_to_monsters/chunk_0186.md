WARLOCK OF l'HEARCHFE 
Warlocks of the archfey gain their powers through mag-
ical pacts forged with lords of the Feywild. These war-
locks commonly associate with lesser fey creatures such 
as boggles, quicklings, redcaps, satyrs, and sprites. 
WARLOCK OF THE FIEND 
Warlocks of the fiend gain their powers through magical 
pacts forged with archfiends of the Lower Planes. These 
warlocks often keep imps or quasits as companions, and 
they tend toward extremes of behavior: consorting with 
fiend-worshiping cultists or dedicating their lives to de-
stroying fiendish cults.
