Alignment. Imbued with celestial power, most aasi-
mar are good. Outcast aasimar are most often neutral or 
even evil. 
Size. Aasimar have the same range of height and 
weight as humans. 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Darkvision. Blessed with a radiant soul, your vision 
can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim 
light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in 
darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color 
in darkness, only shades of gray. 
Celestial Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic 
damage and radiant damage. 
Healing Hands. As an action, you can touch a crea-
ture and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal 
to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it 
again until you finish a long rest. 
Light Bearer. You know the light cantrip. Charisma is 
your spellcasting ability for it. 
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and Celestial. 
Subrace. Three subraces of aasimar exist: protector 
aasimar, scourge aasimar, and fallen aasimar. Choose 
one of them for your character. 
PROTECTOR AASIMAR 
Protector aasimar are charged by the powers of good to 
guard the weak, to strike at evil wher,ever it arises, and 
to stand vigilant against the darkness. From a young 
age, a protector aasimar receives advice and directives 
that urge to stand against evil. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score in-
creases by 1. 
Radiant Soul. Starting at 3rd level, you can use your 
action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, 
causing your eyes to glimmer and two luminous, incor-
poreal wings to sprout from your back. 
Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end 
it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 
30 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal ex-
tra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage 
to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage 
equals your level. 
Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you 
finish a long rest. 
SCOURGE AASIMAR 
Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that 
blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire 
to destroy evil-a desire that is, at its best, unflinching 
and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar 
wear masks to block out the world and focus on contain-
ing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score in-
creases by 1. 
Radiant Consumption. Starting at 3rd level, you can 
use your action to unleash the divine energy within your-
self, causing a searing light to radiate from you, pour out 
of your eyes and mouth, and threaten to char you. 
Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end 
ii as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in 
a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, 
and at the end of each of your turns, you and each crea-
ture within 10 feet of you take radiant damage equal to 
half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each 
of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one 
target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a 
spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. 
Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you 
finish a long rest. 
FALLEN AASIMAR 
An aasimar who was touched by dark powers as a youth 
or who turns to evil in early adulthood can become one 
of the fallen-a group of aasimar whose inner light has 
been replaced by shadow. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score in-
creases by 1. 
Necrotic Shroud. Starting at 3rd level, you can use 
your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, 
causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two 
skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your 
back. The instant you transform, other creatures within 
10 feet of you that can see you must each succeed on a 
Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus 
+ your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you 
until the end of your next turn. 
Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you 
end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your 
turns, you can deal extra ne-
crotic damage to one target 
when you deal damage to 
it with an attack or a spell. 
The extra necrotic damage 
equals your level. 
Once you use this trait, 
you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 
With your DM's consent, you can change your charac· 
ter's subrace to fallen aasimar if your protector/scourge 
aasimar turns to evil. To do so, replace your subrace ben-
efits, including the ability score increase, with those of a 
fallen aasimar. 
Similarly, if your fallen aasimar turns to good, your DM 
might allow you to become a protector or scourge aasimar.
