MIGHTY FIGHTERS, POOR PLANNERS 
When fire giants aren't honing their crafting skills, 
they're drilling with weapons or exercising to keep 
themselves fit for battle. The typical fire giant has a mas-
tery of combat tactics that few other warriors can match, 
but the giants' understanding of strategy is rudimentary. 
This deficiency isn't born from a lack of ability, but 
has its roots in tradition. In ages past, when the giants 
worked together to dominate the world, strategy was 
determined by the cloud giants and the storm giants. 
Ever since the clans went their separate ways after Os-
toria's wars against the dragons, the fire giants have not 
mounted a grand, strategic effort to extend their sway, 
but they have fought countless skirmishes and other tac-
tical engagements, mainly to solidify their hold on terri-
tory they have already claimed. If an ambitious fire giant 
ever became a master of strategic planning (or captured 
and enslaved a cooperative general), little could stop a 
tribe of fire giants that enjoyed this additional advantage 
over their neighbors. 
Fire giants raise and train hell hounds as war dogs, 
and they sometimes persuade human wizards (free or 
enslaved) to harness fire elementals as guardians for 
their strongholds. Some allow trolls to roam free in 
rarely used parts of their fortresses, serving as perim-
eter guards of a sort. Trolls require little maintenance, 
able to survive on the fire giants' scraps and on dead or 
diseased slaves; they're tough enough to deter most in-
SURTUR
1S CLEANSING FIRE 
Surtur, the chief deity of fire giants, is believed to have 
been born alongside Thrym. Each twin then tried to be the 
first to cry out, the first to walk, and the first to talk, and 
they have competed with one another ever since. Often 
in legends these contests are bloody battles, but some 
tales have the brothers acting side by side on grand ad-
ventures. Surtur is seen as the more clever of the two, and 
fire giants emulate his unsurpassed skill at creating and 
building things. 
In the fire giants' world, fire is strength. It burns away 
fmpurities and leaves behind only what is strong enough 
to withstand the heat, such as the best steel from the 
forge. When fire is controlled, it is the giants' most power-
ful tool; when lt rages unchecked, it can bring down forests 
and lay waste to cities. 
Because of the destructive power of fire, the worship of 
Surtur is tinged with an apocalyptic air. Some observers 
suspect that priests of Surtur maintain clandestine work-
shops and armories where they manufacture and stockpile 
battle gear in preparation for a final, all-encompassing bat-
tle that will decide the filte of the world. If the suspicions 
are true, these sites are expertly hidden and kept secret 
even from most fire giants. 
truders; and their susceptibility to fire makes them little 
threat to a fire giant. 
SLAVES: LABOR-SAVING DEVICES 
It takes a lot of work to build and maintain a fire giant 
stronghold. Most of that effort comes not from the giants 
themselves, but from the slaves that they keep. Fire 
giants enslave other creatures to accomplish unskilled 
labor, so the giants can concentrate on the more vital 
aspects of foundry operation and crafting that only they 
are capable of. They aren't overly cruel masters, but nei-
ther are they particularly kind- they are uncaring about 
their slaves, because slaves aren't giants, and there are 
always more to be had if the supply runs low. 
Most creatures that fire giants capture are put to work 
in the giants' mines or on surface farms the giants claim 
as part of their domain. Even master crafters of other 
races are consigned to unskilled labor, because so few 
of them have talents the fire giants consider "skilled." 
Only creatures that have skills the fire giants need but 
don't practice (because they aren't valued in the ord-
ning), such as accounting, brewing, and medicine, are 
allowed to continue plying their trades. 
Skilled slaves receive better treatment, at least in 
the sense that an owner uses less force with a delicate 
tool, but as a rule fire giants view humans in much the 
same way that humans view horses: they have utility if 
properly directed, and some might be prized for rare 
qualities, but even the smartest, best trained horse isn't 
a person. That said, it's not unheard of for a fire giant to 
"consult with" a slave physician when it falls ill, or with 
a slav~ engineer right before beginning a difficult stage 
of tunnel excavation. (Such a consultation would only be 
to ensure that the right tools and materials are on hand 
for the excavation, not to solicit a second opinion on the 
giant's personal assessment of the structure's integrity.) 
Giants that stand low in the ordning are assigned to 
manage slaves and mining operations. Excavating mine 
shafts and digging out ore is important work, but smelt-
ing and metalwork are valued more highly than effort 
spent keeping a tunnel from collapsing on slaves. 
PAYING THE PRICE 
Fire giants on many occasions have ransomed captives 
back to their families or communities, once the giants 
determined that a slave had no particular talent they 
needed and others were willing to pay for its return. Af-
fluent prisoners such as merchants and aristocrats are 
the most likely to win this sort of reprieve, for obvious 
reasons. The ransom demanded rarely involves baubles 
such as gold or gems: fire giants prefer payment in mi-
thral, adamantine, or different slaves (ones with more 
useful talents or stronger backs). 
FROST GIANTS 
Frost giants dwell in the remote, frozen places of the 
world. Anything warmer than the flesh of a recently 
killed elk is as flame to them. As a sailor fears the howl 
of the wind heralding a storm, the denizens of ice-
capped mountains and northern steppes shudder at 
the war horns that presage the arrival of Thrym's blue-
skinned, icy children.
