VEGEPYGMIES 
Vegepygmies are fungus creatures that live in simple 
tribal units, hunting for sustenance and spreading the 
spores from which they reproduce. 
Primitive Plants. Vegepygmies, also called mold folk 
or moldies, inhabit dark areas that are warm and wet, so 
they are most commonly found underground or in dense 
forests where little sunlight penetrates. A vegepygmy 
instinctively feels kinship with other plant and fungus 
creatures, and thus vegepygmy tribes coexist well with 
creatures such as myconids, shriekers, and violet fungi. 
Although they prefer to eat fresh meat, bone, and 
blood, vegepygmies can absorb nutrients from soil and 
many sorts of organic matter, meaning that they rarely 
go hungry. A vegepygmy can hiss and make other noises 
by forcing air through its mouth, but it can't speak in a 
conventional sense. Among themselves, vegepygmies 
communicate by hissing, gestures, and rhythmic tap-
ping on the body. Vegepygmies build and craft little; any 
gear they have is acquired from other creatures or built 
by copying simple construction they have witnessed. 
RUSSET MOLD 
The fungus known as russet mold is reddish-brown in 
color and found only in places that are dark, warm, and 
wet. Russet mold that spreads out across a metal object 
can be mistaken for natural rust, and a successful DC 15 
Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check is re-
quired to identify it accurately by sight in such a case. 
Any creature that comes within 5 feet of russet mold 
must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as the mold 
emits a puff of spores. On a failed save, the creature be-
comes poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the creature 
takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its 
turns, sprouting mold as it takes damage. The creature 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itselfon a success. Any magic that 
neutralizes poison or cures disease kills the infestation. 
A creature reduced to O hit points by the mold's poison 
damage dies. If the dead creature is a beast, a giant, or a 
humanoid, one or more newborn vegepygmies emerge 
from its body 24 hours later: one newborn from a Small 
corpse, two from a Medium corpse, four from a Large 
corpse, eight from a Huge corpse, or sixteen from a Gar-
gantuan corpse. 
Russet mold can be hard to kill, since weapons and 
most types of damage do it no harm. Effects that deal acid, 
necrotic, or radiant damage kill 1 square foot of russet 
mold per 1 damage dealt. A pound of salt, a gallon of alco-
hol, or a magical effect that cures disease kills russet mold 
in a square area that is 10 feet on a side. Sunlight kills any 
russet mold in the light's area. 
Mold Begets Mold. Vegepygmies originate from the 
remains left behind when a humanoid or a giant is killed 
by russet mold. One or more vegepygmies emerge from 
the corpse a day later. If a beast such as a dog or a bear 
dies from russet mold, the result is a bestial moldie 
called a thorny result instead of a humanoid-shaped 
vegepygmy. Thornies are less intelligent than vegepyg-
mies, but have greater size and ferocity, as well as a 
thorn-covered body. 
As a vegepygmy ages, it grows tougher and develops 
spore clusters on its body. Spore-bearing vegepygmies 
are deferred to by other vegepygmies, so outsiders re-
fer to such vegepygmies as chiefs. A chief can expel its 
spores in a burst, infecting nearby creatures. If a crea-
ture dies while infected, its corpse produces vegepyg-
mies the same way russet mold does. 
No one knows for sure where russet mold came from. 
One historical account tells of adventurers in a forbid-
ding mountain range discovering russet mold and vege-
pygmies in a peculiar metal dungeon full of stra,nge life. 
Another story says that explorers found russet mold in 
a crater left by a falling star, with vegepygmies infesting 
the dense jungle nearby.

Regeneration. The vegepygmy regains 3 hit points at the start 
of its turn. lf ittakes cold, fire, or necrotic damage, this trait 
doesn't function at the start of the vegepygmy's next turn. The

doesn't regenerate.
