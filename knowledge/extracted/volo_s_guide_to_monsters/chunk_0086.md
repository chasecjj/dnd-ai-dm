FIRBOLG 
-
WE SPENT THREE MONfHS TRACKING THE GREEN DRAGON 
before locating the forest in which it sought refuge. On our 
second day in that place, we woke to find the dragon's head 
placed in the center of our camp. Soveliss told me that 
firbolgs must have claimed the forest, and they wanted to 
show us we had no further business there. If we lingered, he 
assured me, our heads would be next. 
-Gimble, Notes from a Treasure Hunter 
Firbolg tribes cloister in remote forest strongholds, 
preferring to spend their days in quiet harmony with the 
woods. When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formida-
ble skills with weapons and druidic magic. 
HUMBLE GUARDIANS 
Firbolgs love nothing more than a peaceful day spent 
among the trees of an old forest. They see forests as 
sacred places, representing the heart of the world and 
monuments to the durability of life. 
In their role as caretakers, firbolgs live off the land 
while striving to remain in balance with nature. Their 
methods reflect common sense and remarkable re-
sourcefulness. During a bountiful summer, they store 
away excess nuts, fruit, and berries. When winter ar-
rives, they scatter everything they can spare to ensure 
the animals of the wood survive until springtime. 
In a firbolg's eyes, there is no greater fault than greed. 
The firbolgs believe that the world remains healthiest 
when each creature takes only what it needs. Material 
goods, especially precious gems and gold, have little 
appeal to them. What use are such things when winter 
lingers and food runs short? 
NATURAL DRUIDS 
Firbolgs have a talent for druidic magic. Their cultural 
reverence for nature, combined with their strong and 
insightful minds, makes learning such magic an in-
stinctive part of their development. Almost every firbolg 
learns a few spells, typically those used to mask their 
presence, and many go on to master nature magic. 
Firbolgs who become druids serve as stronghold lead-
ers. With every action the tribe takes, the druids weigh 
not only the group's needs, but the effect each action will 
have on the forest and the rest of the natural world. Fir-
bolg tribes would rather go hungry than strain the land 
during a famine. 
HIDDEN SHEPHERDS 
As caretakers of the land, firbolgs prefer to remain out 
of sight and out of mind. They don't try to dominate 
nature, but rather seek to ensure that it prospers and 
survives according to its own laws. 
Firbolgs use their magic to keep their presence in a 
forest secret. This approach allows them to avoid the 
politics and struggles of elves, humans, and ores. Such 
events concern the firbolgs only when the events affect 
the forest. 
CHAPTER 2 I CHARACTER RACES 
Even in the face of an intrusion, firbolgs prefer a 
subtle, gentle approach to prevent damage to their ter-
ritory. They employ their magic to make the forest an 
unappealing place to explore by temporarily diverting 
springs, driving away game, stealing critical tools, 
and altering trails to leave hunting or lumber parties 
hopelessly lost. The firbolgs' presence is marked by an 
absence of animals and a strange quiet, as if the forest 
wishes to avoid attracting attention to itself. The faster 
travelers decide to move on, the better. 
If these tactics fail, the firbolgs take more direct 
action. Their observations of a settlement determine 
what happens next. If the outsiders seem peaceful, the 
firbolgs approach and gently ask them to leave, even 
offering food and other supplies to aid their departure. 
If those who insist on remaining respect nature, take 
only what they need, and live in harmony with the wood, 
firbolgs explore the possibility of friendship with them, 
as long as the outsiders vow to safeguard the forest. If 
the settlers clearly display evil intentions, however, the 
firbolgs martial their strength and magic for a single 
overwhelming attack. 
OUTCAST ADVENTURERS 
As guardians of the wood, few firbolgs would dream 
of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human 
society. An exiled firbolg, or one whose clan has been 
destroyed, might not have a choice in the matter. Most 
adventuring firbolgs fall into this latter category. 
Outcast firbolgs can never return home. They commit-
ted some unforgivable deed, usually something that put 
their homeland at risk, such as starting a forest fire or 
killing a rare or beautiful wild creature. These firbolgs 
are loners who wander the world in hope of finding a 
new place to call home. 
Orphaned firbolgs are those whose clans or home-
lands have been destroyed. They become crusaders for 
nature, seeking to avenge their loss and prevent the fur-
ther destruction of the natural world. 
A few rare firbolgs are entrusted i;>y their clan with an 
important mission that takes them beyond their homes. 
These firbolgs feel like pilgrims in a strange land, and 
usually they wish only to complete their quests and re-
turn home as quickly as possible. 
The Firbolg Adventurers table can serve as inspiration 
for determining why a firbolg character leaves home.
