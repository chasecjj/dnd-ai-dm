ARCHDRUID 
Archdruids watch over the natural wonders of their do-
mains. They seldom interact with civilized folk unless 
there is a great threat to the natural order. An archdruid 
typically has one or more pupils who are druids (see the 
Monster Manual for statistics), and the archdruid's lair 
is usually guarded by loyal beasts and fey creatures.

Change Shape (2/Day). The archdruid magically polymorphs 
into a beast or elemental with a challenge rating of 6 or less, 
and can remain in this form for up to 9 hours. The archdruid 
can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground, melds 
with its new form, or is worn by the new form. The archdruid 
reverts to its true form if it dies or falls unconscious. The 
archdruid can revert to its true form using a bonus action 
on its turn. 
While in a new form, the archdruid retains !ts game statistics 
and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, 
and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it 
gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and 
reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair 
actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. It can cast its 
spells with verbal or somatic components in its new form. 
The new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of 
overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.
