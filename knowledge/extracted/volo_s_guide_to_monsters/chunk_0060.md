butter knives is liable to come away with a newfound 
respect for the little creatures. 
The following are examples of common kobold traps: 
• Barrels or small pots of oil (to be boiled, spilled, 
lit, or both) 
Bear traps that fall on tall creatures' heads 
• Bells to announce intruders 
• Block-and-tackle mine elevators rigged to fall 
• Caltrops in shallow mud or soft dirt (light kobolds can 
walk on them without trouble) 
• Collapsing ceilings 
• Crates of centipedes 
• Falling blocks 
• Moats full of pitch or oil, which the kobolds can retreat 
behind and ignite 
• Nets attached to ropes that pull creatures up vertical 
shafts far away from anyone who can help 
• Pipes/shafts that dump boiling water (either from 
cookpots or from cooling the kiln) 
• Pits with disease-covered spikes 
• Pots of green slime 
• Rolling boulders 
• Small-size bridges and ladders rigged to break if there 
is too much weight on them 
• Snares 
• Tripwires, either connected to traps or just for trip-
ping creatures 
• Volleys of needles 
SURVIVAL SKILLS 
Nearly every activity in a kobold lair contributes to the 
tribe's survival. Guarding the lair keeps all of them safe 
from harm. Setting snares, farming mushrooms, and 
hunting provide food. Building traps deters intruders. 
Training guard animals helps protect the lair. Mining 
provities gems and ore for bribing enemies to leave them 
alone. Carving tunnels and rooms creates spaces for the 
next generation to live and improves the opportunity for 
the tribe to escape an overwhelming force. 
The kobolds in a lair sleep in shifts, and all activities 
in the warren go on around the clock. Kobolds tend to 
be more active at night than during daylight hours, but 
unlike in a human settlement, there is no time when 
most of the inhabitants are resting. Warrens are built 
so that sleeping areas are somewhat isolated from the 
noise of work areas, enabling miners and crafters to do 
their work without awakening the sleepers. Kobolds 
learn at a young age to fall asleep to the noise of ham-
mering nearby, but they still wake quickly at the sound 
of unusual activity. 
Survival of the tribe is more important than the life 
of any particular individual. Even a cowardly kobold 
might sacrifice itself to give its fellows time to collapse a 
nearby tunnel and prevent invaders from getting to the 
rest of the tribe. All kobolds know that fleeing from dan-
ger, especially against bad odds, is the smart thing to do, 
but they are smart enough to realize that the strategic 
death of an individual can buy valuable time for the rest 
of the tribe, and each individual reluctantly accepts this 
need for sacrifice when it presents itself. This practice 
contributes to the reason why most common folk (and

adventurers) think kobolds are stupid as well as weak; 
they've seen or heard of a lone kobold trying to hold off 
a group of armed attackers and attribute the act either 
to idiocy or the creature's ridiculously inflated idea 
of its prospects for success. The truth is that the lone 
kobold-persuaded into this role by its peers- is just 
hoping to slow down the invaders long enough to give 
the rest of the tribe time to prepare a lethal trap, an am-
bush, or a quick getaway. 
The tribe's leader is usually the oldest and smartest 
kobold; the other kobolds respect the old one's ability to 
survive so long, and they assume the leader will use that 
knowledge to help the tribe survive. In some cases, the 
best lesson a kobold leader can teach is "I don't have to 
be faster than the bear. I just have to be faster than you." 
MIND FLAYERS: SCOURGE 
OF WORLDS 
Mind flayers, also known as illithids, are horrific, alien 
humanoids that lurk deep within the Underdark. Mas-
ters of psionic energy, they use their mental powers to 
dominate other creatures. The fortunate among their 
victims are slain, their brains devoured. The unlucky 
ones have their psyches warped, leaving them as mind-
less slaves with little hope of being rescued. 
A CULTURE OF FUGITIVES 
Despite all their unique and overwhelming abilities, the 
mind flayers are a race on the edge of extinction. 
Thousands of years ago, the illithids were the dom-
inant power of the Inner Planes. From their astral 
domains, they launched flying vessels called nautiloids, 
able to cross between planes, so that they could harvest 
intelligent humanoids from hundreds of worlds. 
The mind flayers relied on a slave race, the gith, to 
provide physical labor and sustenance when other 
sources of food grew thin. Eventually, the gith revolted. 
Whether the mind flayers became decadent or the gith 
discovered a weakness, none can say. What is known 
is that after centuries of domination, the mind flayer 
empire collapsed in less than a year. The gith rose up, 
slaughtered their masters, and destroyed almost all 
traces of the illithids' astral domains. 
Only the mind flayers that had infiltrated the worlds of 
the Material Plane survived, and their safety was short-
lived. Both the githzerai and the githyanki, two factions 
that arose from the victorious gith, sent hunting parties 
to root out and slaughter the remaining mind flayers. 
To this day, isolated clutches of mind flayers remain 
in hiding, seeking ways to recapture their former glory 
but hampered by their paranoia of being discovered and 
destroyed by their enemies. 
LOST COLONIES 
Speculation persists concerning mind flayer realms yet 
adrift in the Astral Plane. Though no one has discovered 
such a place, it is beyond dispute that an empire as vast 
as the illithids' built great cities and other edifices. Most 
sages, however, believe that the gith tore apart every last 
bit of mind flayer artifice, ensuring that no evidence re-
mained of the mind flayers' reign. 
VARIANT: MIND FLAYER PSION 
Mind flayers sometimes devote themselves to deeper 
study of psionic power, and many excel at using their 
innate psionic energy to duplicate the casting of spells. A 
mind flayer psion has the same statistics as a mind flayer 
(as presented in the Monster Manua~. except that its chal-
lenge rating is 8 (3,900 XP) and it has the following trait: 
Innate Spellcasting (Psionics). The mind flayer is a 10th-
level spellcaster. Its innate spellcasting ability is Intel-
ligence (spell save DC l S; +7 to hit with spell attacks). 
It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no 
components: 
At will: guidance, mage hand, vicious mockery, true strike 
1st level (4 slots): charm person, command, comprehend 
languages, sanctuary 
2nd level (3 slots): crown of madness, phantasmal force, see 
invisibility 
3rd level (3 slots): claiwoyance,ftar, meld into stone 
4th level (3 slots): confosion, stone shape 
5th level (2 slots): scrying, telekinesis 
A few skeptics suggest that the entire narrative of the 
gith victory rings false. How could a slave race over-
power the mind flayers? Where are the signs of this 
great struggle? Perhaps the gith didn't actually win. Per-
haps, instead, the mind flayers moved themselves and 
their works into the future to avoid being overrun. That 
theory would explain the mind flayers' disappearance 
and the absence of any ruins from their empire. 
Few folk take such talk seriously, yet no one can be 
sure exactly what the illithids are and are not capable of. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAINS 
Because of their dietary needs and their otherworldly bi-
ology, mind flayers must remain within hunting distance 
of intelligent humanoids, even if doing so makes them 
vulnerable to attack from their enemies. They use the 
brains of such creatures as food, of course, but they also 
need sentient humanoids to propagate. 
FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
When a mind flayer devours a brain, it acquires stray 
memories from its victim and shares them with the 
other members of its colony. Mind flayers also receive a 
degree of sustenance from the physical substance of a 
brain, but subsist primarily on the psionic energy that 
they extract from it in its final moments of activity. 
Through some quirk of the illithids' parasitic nature, 
the cultural sophistication of a mind flayer depends 
upon what sorts of brains are in its diet. For example, 
members of a colony that feed on grimlocks are no less 
intelligent than a colony that feeds on elves, but the for-
mer will pay almost no attention to crafting clothes to 
wear, and the latter will dress in elaborate robes. This 
phenomenon extends to all displays of culture, from 
modes of architecture to the decorations that adorn il-
lithid funerary brain jars.
