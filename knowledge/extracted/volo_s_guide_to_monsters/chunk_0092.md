COLD AND CALCULATING 
Most humanoids describe cold-blooded people as lack-
ing in emotion and empathy. The same label serves as 
an apt depiction of lizardfolk. 
Lacking any internal emotional reactions, lizardfolk 
behave in a distant manner. They don't mourn fallen 
comrades or rage against their enemies. They simply 
observe and react as a situation warrants. 
Lizardfolk lack meaningful emotional ties to the past. 
They assess situations based on their current and fu-
ture utility and importance. Nowhere does this come 
through as strongly as when lizardfolk deal with the 
dead. To a lizardfolk, a comrade who dies becomes a po-
tential source of food. That companion might have once 
been a warrior or hunter, but now the body is just freshly 
killed meat. 
A lizardfolk who lives among other humanoids can, 
over time, learn to respect other creatures' emotions. 
The lizardfolk doesn't share those feelings, but instead 
assesses them in the same clinical manner. Yes, the 
fallen dwarf might be most useful as a meal, but hacking 
the body into steaks provokes aggression in the other 
humanoids and makes them less helpful in battle. 
CHAPTER 2 I CHARACTER RACl:'.S 
UTILITY AND SURVIVAL 
The lizardfolk mindset might seem unnecessarily cruel, 
but it helps them survive in a hostile environment. The 
swamps they inhabit are filled with a staggering variety 
of threats. Lizardfolk focus on survival above all, with-
out sentiment. 
Lizardfolk assess everyone and everything in terms 
of utility. Art and beauty have little meaning for them. A 
sharp sword serves a useful and good purpose, while a 
dull sword is a dead weight without a whetstone. 
Lizardfolk see little need to plan more than a season 
or so into the future. This approach allows them to 
maintain their current level of influence in the world, 
but it limits their growth. Lizardfolk have no interest in 
developing writing, making long-term plans, or cultivat-
ing other methods to progress beyond their simple exis-
tence as hunters and gatherers. 
HAPLESS SOFT ONES 
At their core, lizardfolk view other humanoids with an 
indifference verging on pity. Born into the world lacking 
stout scales and sharp teeth, it's a wonder they have 
managed to survive for so long. The typical human 
would barely make it through a day in the swamps. 
Still, if other creatures prove useful to lizardfolk, 
those creatures can trigger a protective response made 
all the stronger by their apparent weakness. The liz-
ardfolk assess such beings as hatchlings, young ones 
incapable of protecting themselves but who might prove 
useful in the future if they receive care.
