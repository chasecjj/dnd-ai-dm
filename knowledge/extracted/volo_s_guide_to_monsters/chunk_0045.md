Hags make bargains differently from how devils op-
erate. A devil might approach a mortal to make a deal 
because it wants the individual to become tainted with 
evil, so that when the victim dies its soul goes to the 
Nine Hells. Hags are usually content to wait and conduct 
their own business, allowing mortals to come to them 
when the perceived need is great enough. Instead of 
being interested in a mortal's soul, a hag wants to bring 
the mortal low during its life as compensation for fulfill-
ing her end of the bargain. Devils barter with the soul as 
the commodity; hags barter because they enjoy making 
people miserable. Night hags, as fey turned fiends, use 
aspects of both methods-corrupting a mortal's dreams 
until the creature commits enough evil acts that she can 
claim its soul. 
As much as she enjoys offering and enforcing her bar-
gains, a hag rarely goes out looking for people to make 
deals with because she knows that someone coming 
to her puts her in a position of power. The visitor likely 
had to approach the hag in secret for fear of causing an 
uproar in town, and is probably eager to return home 
before being missed, which adds time pressure to the 
process and tips the balance more in the hag's favor. All 
these factors contribute to the hag's being able to set her 
terms for the bargain, presenting an offer that appears 
reasonable, and perhaps seems to have a tempting loop-
hole or two that the mortal could exploit. 
Hags understand mortal desires and vices, and know 
how to manipulate people by preying on those qualities. 
A hag's bargain might bring success and prosperity for 
a time, but eventually have a drawback or side effect 
that makes the mortal resent the agreement and seek 
to get out of it. The philandering spouse now happy 
to stay home might grow slothful, the mayor's father 
might turn violent after regaining his senses, and the 
merchant's child might relapse if not treated again every 
few months. 
Even when a bargain turns sour for a mortal and other 
people in town hear about or see the person's misfor-
tune, the hag will eventually attract new customers. 
Other people will come to believe that they can outsmart 
the hag, or that their need is simple and can't be per-
verted, or that the earlier victims got too greedy when 
they were proposing a deal. Even if only one or two peo-
ple make deals with a hag every year, over time many 
unfortunates can come under her sway-and she re-
members the exact terms of every one of those bargains. 
MAKING A DEAL OUT OF DESIRE 
Although it could be argued that there's no good time to 
make a bargain with a hag, mortals are more likely to 
get away in good shape if they offer up something a hag 
needs or wants. In such a case, the hag might even start 
the bidding. 
A hag that faces a serious threat from enemies will 
not hesitate to use promises or bribes to defuse the sit-
uation. For instance, most treasures in a hag's lair are 
useless without her knowledge of how to identify and 
handle them, so she might offer to provide such infor-
mation in return for her life. If an item later backfires on 
the one who uses it, or turns out to be cursed in some 
way, that's just another lesson in why never to never 
threaten or trust a hag.
