MORKOTH 
Ancient and devious, morkoths are voracious collectors. 
Each one travels the planes, amassing the valuables, 
oddities, and castoffs of the multiverse to make its col-
lection ever more complete. 
Spawned by a God. Long ago, a deity of greed and 
strife perished in the battles among the immortals. Its 
body drifted through the Astral Plane, eventually be-
coming a petrified husk. This corpse floated up against 
a pearlescent remnant of celestial matter imbued with 
life and life-giving magic. The collision shattered both 
objects and released a storm of chaotic energy. Count-
less islands of mixed matter spun away into the silvery 
void. Within some of them, a vein of pearl-like material 
held a bit of the deity's rejuvenated supernatural vitality, 
which spontaneously created a habitable environment. 
On those same islands, bits of the god's petrified flesh 
came back to life, in the form of tentacled monstrosi-
ties brimming with malice and greed. Ever since that 
time, each morkoth has had an extraplanar island to 
call home. 
No Rhyme or Reason. A morkoth's island has the 
qualities of a dreamscape in which nature and predict-
ability take a back seat to strangeness and chaos. Upon 
it is a jumble of objects and a mixture of creatures, 
some of which date from forgotten times. An island 
might have natural-looking illumination, but most are 
shrouded in twilight, and on any of them, mists and 
shadows can appear without notice. The environment 
is warm and wet, a subtropical or tropical climate that 
keeps the morkoth and its "guests" comfortable. 
The pearly matter inside an island enables it to glide 
on planar currents, maintains the island's environment, 
and keeps the place safe from harmful external effects. 
A morkoth's island might be found anywhere from the 
bottom of the ocean to the void of the Astral Plane. One 
could float in the skies of Avernus in the Nine Hells 
without being destroyed and without causing harm to its 
residents. Whatever is on or within a certain distance 
of a morkoth's isle travels with it in its journey through 
the planes. Thus, people from lost civilizations and crea-
tures or objects from bygone ages might be found within 
a morkoth's dominion. 
Some islands travel a specific route, arriving at the 
same destinations regularly over a cycle of years. Others 
are tied to a particular place or group of locales, and still 
others move erratically through the cosmos. Rarely, a 
morkoth learns to control its island's movement, so the 
island goes wherever its master wishes. 
Primeval Hoarders. Morkoths are driven by greed 
and selfishness, mixed with a yearning for conflict. They 
desire anything they don't possess, have no scruples 
about taking what they crave, and endeavor to keep ev-
erything they collect. 
A morkoth spends its time watching over its collection 
and plotting to acquire more possessions. The monster 
hoards vast stores of treasure and knowledge. Its island 
holds numerous captives, which it considers part of its 
collection. Some inhabitants, such as descendants of 
original prisoners, might view the morkoth as a ruler 
or a god. A morkoth's storehouse of wealth and lore at-

tracts would-be plunderers, of course, as well as those 
seeking something specific the morkoth has or knows. 
The creature shows no mercy to those that try to steal 
from it, but it can be bargained with by a visitor that of-
fers the morkoth something it desires. 
No morkoth freely gives away what it owns. Morkoths 
exist to acquire, and they give up possessions only if do-
ing so helps their hoard grow. 
A morkoth knows every object in its collection and can 
track its possessions through the planes. Someone who 
dares to steal from a morkoth, or breaks a deal with one, 
will know no rest until the morkoth is slain or all prom-
ises are kept. 
A MORKOTH
1S LAIR 
A morkoth claims dominion over an entire island, and it 
also maintains a central sanctum on that isle. This lair 
is most often a twisted network of narrow tunnels that 
connect several underground chambers, although other 
structural forms might be incorporated. The morkoth 
dwells among its most prized possessions in a spacious 
vault at the core of the warren, where the pearly matter 
of the island is also located. Sections of the lair and its 
center might be kept dry to better protect and preserve 
collected objects and creatures, but most of the lair is 
underwater. 
A morkoth encountered in its lair has a challenge rat-
ing of 12 (8,400 XP).
