Dreamwalker's Charm. An enemy that starts its turn within 30 
feet of the giant must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, 
provided that the giant isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the 
creature is charmed by the giant. A creature charmed in this 
way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on 
the saving throw, the creature is immune to this giant's Dream-
walker's Charm for 24 hours. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The giant makes two attacks with its greatclub. 
Creatclub. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one 
tari:et. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. 
Petrifying Touch. The giant touches one Medium or smaller 
creature within 10 feet of it that is charmed by it. The target 
must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed 
save, the target becomes petrified, and the giant can adhere 
the target to its stony body. Greater restoration spells and other 
magic that can undo petrification have no effect on a petrified 
creature on the giant unless the giant is dead, in which case the 
magic works normally, freeing the petrified creature as well as 
ending the petrified condition on it. 
Rocle . . Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one 
target. Hit: 28 (4dl0 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a 
creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or 
be knocked prone.

STORM GIANT QUINTESSENT 
To forestall the inevitable, some storm giants approach-
ing the end of their natural life spans seek an escape 
from death. They plumb the depths of their powerful 
connection to the elements and disperse themselves 
into nature, literally transforming into semiconscious 
storms. The blizzard that rages unendingly around a 
mountain peak, the vortex that swirls around a remote 
island, or the thunderstorm that howls ceaselessly up 
and down a rugged coastline could, in fact, be the undy-
ing form of a storm giant clinging to existence. 
Elemental Weapons. A storm giant quintessent sheds 
its armor and weapons, but gains the power to form 
makeshift weapons out of thin air. When the giant has 
no further use of them, or when the giant dies, its ele-
mental weapons disappear. 
Forsaken Form. A storm giant quintessent can revert 
to its true giant form on a whim. The change is tempo-
rary but can be maintained long enough for the giant to 
communic~te with a mortal, carry out a short task, or 
defend its home against aggressors. 
A QUINTESSENT'S LAIR 
A storm giant quintessent has no need for castles or 
dungeon lairs. Its lair is usually a secluded region or 
prominent geographic feature, such as a mountain peak, 
a great waterfall, a remote island, a fog-shrouded loch, 
a beautiful coral reef, or a windswept desert bluff. As 
befits the environment, the storm in which the giant 
lives could be a blizzard, a typhoon, a thunderstorm, or 
a sandstorm. 
Lair Actions. A storm giant quintessent can use 
lair actions in giant form and while transformed into 
a storm. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), 
the giant can take a lair action to cause one of the fol-
lowing effects; the giant can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row: 
• The giant creates a thunderclap centered on a point 
anywhere in its lair. Each creature within 20 feet of 
that point must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution sav-
ing throw or be deafened until the end of its next turn. 
• The giant creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog (or 
murky water within water) centered on a point any-
where in its lair. The sphere spreads around corners, 
and its area is heavily obscured. The fog lasts until the
