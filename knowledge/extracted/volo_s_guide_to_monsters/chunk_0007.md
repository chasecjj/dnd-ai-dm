and shoot any creature it can see within the range of its 
darkvision. A dark room with a 120-foot ceiling allows it 
to use this tactic, requiring opponents to create light at a 
distance in order to return fire with any accuracy. 
Even intruders who don't need light to see have to con-
tend with the beholder's superior senses-the monster 
can see its opponents before 60-foot darkvision sees it. 
USE ANTIMAGIC FREELY 
Although a beholder can't use its rays on targets inside 
the area of its antimagic cone, the ability of its central 
eye is incredibly effective in combat- instantly crippling 
enemy spellcasters, revealing the exact location of any-
one using blur or invisibility, and causing opponents 
using magical flight to plummet to the ground. The cone 
is wide enough that the beholder can usually redirect it 
toward any particular creature trying to escape the area, 
keeping that target locked down until the monster has 
killed all the enemies outside the cone. 
A beholder can use its telekinesis ray in conjunction 
with its antimagic cone to lift a heavy object above the 
cone and drop it onto an opponent inside the cone; grav-
ity finishes the job, even though the cone negates the 
beholder's telekinetic control. 
The ability to temporarily suspend magical effects 
is useful to a beholder for determining if a minion has 
been charmed or compelled to act against its master; 
the creature might change its behavior when inside the 
cone, or it might remember or be able to speak of things 
it was compelled to forget or keep secret. 
Because the cone suppresses ongoing magical ef-
fects, the beholder might create a secure area in its lair 
behind a permanent wall of fire or wall of force, make 
use of an existing magical hazard (such as a pool that 
transforms any creature that touches it), or an area with 
magical guardians (such as an old shrine with a demon 
bound to it) that it can bypass. 
USE EYE RAYS TO BEST EFFECT 
A beholder can fire multiple eye rays on its turn, and it 
might use all of them in succession on its most danger-
ous foe. Even a very tough fighter is going to have sec-
ond thoughts after taking damage from a disintegration 
ray, an enervation ray, and a death ray. 
A beholder can shift its targets after its first or second 
rays. For example, if a beholder intends to shoot charm, 
slowing, and sleep rays at a ranger, and the ranger suc-
cumbs to the charm, the beholder could use its remain-
ing rays against other targets. 
USE LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The beholder's ability to use legendary actions effec-
tively doubles the number of times it can shoot rays in 
a round. Each legendary action a beholder takes gives 
it an opportunity to react to a change in circumstances, 
or to press an assault that it began on its turn. For in-
stance, it might use its sleep ray as a legendary action 
against an enemy that has just been awakened. If no 
such opportunity presents itself, legendary actions are 
always useful for piling rays on the most dangerous foe.
