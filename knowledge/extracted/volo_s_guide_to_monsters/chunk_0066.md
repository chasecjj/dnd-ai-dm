-ELMINSTER 
Most colonies that possess a nautiloid save it for use 
as an emergency escape vehicle. If pressed by attackers, 
the surviving illithids and the elder brain move into the 
vessel and immediately shift to another world, leaving 
the attackers in their wake. 
MOBILE LAIRS 
A few nautiloids are large enough to hold an entire 
colony, serving as a mobile lair. A colony that uses a 
nautiloid in this way is much more aggressive than other 
colonies, since it can effectively carry out hit-and-run 
attacks and can vacate an area that has been depleted 
of victims. 
These immense vessels invariably have protections 
that enable them to survive in extreme environments. As 
such, the illithids typically locate their lair on a moun-
taintop, beneath the surface of the ocean, or at the upper 
levels of the atmosphere- places where raids by their 
enemies are almost impossible. 
MIND FLAYER MAGIC 
From their perspective as masters of psionic energy, 
mind flayers view magic as a wild, unpredictable, and 
primitive source of power. After all, anything that simple 
humanoids can learn to use must be ineffectual com-
pared to what illithids are capable of. 
ARCANE MAGIC 
Mind flayers consider arcane magic to be an abomi-
nation, a twisted cousin of psionic power that will be 
erased from the multiverse when the illithids' empire 
rises again. Some sages speculate that this attitude 
arose among the mind flayers because magic played an 
important role in the rebellion of the gith. 
In any case, a few renegade mind flayers do pursue 
arcane magic. Using some of the items or spells they 
discover, they can shield their minds as they aspire to 
break free of the elder brain's control. 
Eventually, a mind flayer thus separated from the 
hive turns to the path of lichdom. Just as the elder brain 
offers immortality to its faithful illithids, so does becom-
ing a lich ensure life everlasting. The feeling of freedom 
that comes from this change is liberating, but the spec-
ter of death forever after colors the mind flayer's actions. 
An undead mind flayer is hated and hunted by other 
illithids, but many are powerful enough to stand on their 
own against attackers. 
See the alhoon entry in chapter 3 of this book for 
more information on undead mind flayers. 
FUNERARY BRAIN JARS 
When a mind flayer dies, other mind flayers try to salvage 
the dead illithid's brain and bring it to the colony's brine 
pool for the elder brain to consume. For this purpose, 
mind flayers craft funerary brain jars made of stone. Every 
jar is made for an individual, inscribed with Qualith and 
artwork that relate the mind flayer's accomplishments. Of-
ten a mind flayer's funerary brain jar is created long before 
the illithid's death and updated as the years pass, with the 
jar serving as a diary of sorts for the one whose brain will 
eventually fill it. After it is filled with brine, a funerary brain 
jar can preserve a brain without spoiling for l d4 + l O days. 
DIVINE MAGIC 
Illithids acknowledge the existence of divine entities, but 
it is unusual for any but a deviant mind flayer to actively 
worship such a power. Since they are capable of planar 
travel, illithids don't view the afterlife and the Outer 
Planes in the mythic way that most other races do. 11-
lithids don't believe they possess souls whose eternal 
fate is governed by the gods. Instead; when a mind flay-
er's brain is returned to the elder brain to be consumed, 
the creature's intelligence lives on. Only if an illithid's 
brain isn't retrieved after death would its consciousness 
be cast into oblivion. 
Two divine entities have long been associated with 
mind flayers by the scholars of other races. These aren't 
deities, but rather manifestations of ideal psionic and 
philosophical mental states that mind flayers revere. 
Illithids occasionally meditate on these ideals while 
performing physical movements meant to help them 
achieve the proper attitude- actions that have often 
been misinterpreted by observers as worship. 
Maanzecorian. The entity/concept called Maanzeco-
rian embodies a complete comprehension of knowledge. 
It is a state wherein memories, thoughts, and aptitudes 
are dredged up from one's mind not one at a time as 
needed, but are all laid bare and brought to the fore at 
once. The perfect memories exhibited by aboleths have 
long fascinated mind flayers that emulate Maanzeco-
rian, leading to frequent conflict between the two races. 
Ilsensine. Ilsensine is a broader philosophical ideal 
than Maanzecorian, leading many sages to assume it 
must be the more important or more powerful of the two 
"gods." llsensine represents not just mastery of one's 
own mind but a psionic union between oneself and the 
realm of universal knowledge. Different elder brains 
have different interpretations of what this state consists 
of and how to achieve it. Elder brains and illithids that 
devote themselves to llsensine sometimes pursue ways 
to dominate gods of knowledge or even aspire to sup-
plant those gods on the way to attaining the state of full 
incorporation into the universal consciousness. 
MIND FLAYER MAGIC ITEMS 
Some mind flayer colonies have developed the ability 
to create or modify certain kinds of gear, imbuing them 
with psionic energy. Mind flayers craft magic items that 
only they or their thralls can use- a sensible security 
measure to keep enemies from turning the illithids' own 
creations against them.
