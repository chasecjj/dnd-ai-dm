HILL GIANTS 
Hill giants live to eat. Anyone who understands this one 
fact about them knows everything there is to know. 
0RDNING OF GLUTTONY 
Hill giants are the weakest of the true giants. They have 
the shortest stature, the smallest brains, and the least 
ambition. The only area in which they excel is girth. 
Since eating is the only thing hill giants care about, a 
. tribe is always led by its fattest, heaviest member-the 
most successful and thus the most admired one in 
the group. The qualities that other creatures expect 
or demand of their leaders- such as intellect, deci-
sion-making ability, and personal magnetism- have no 
importance to hill giants. They are neither recognized 
nor rewarded, except to the extent that a hill giant with 
slightly above average smarts might use trickery or in-
timidation to grab more food than its neighbors. 
DENS OF SQUALOR AND STENCH 
Hill giants stuff the most repulsive, rotting things into 
their mouths without hesitation, suggesting that either 
they have no sense of taste or their hunger is so all-con-
suming that flavor isn't a consideration. Whatever the 
reason, the upshot is that hill giant dens are filthy, reek-
ing places. Decaying carcasses and cracked bones are 
strewn about. The ground is saturated with blood and 
with the giants' own filth. 
Not every hill giant's digestive system is so indiscrim-
inate; from time to time a giant does get sick, but most 
of them recover and don't learn anything from the expe-
rience. The rare exceptions are called mouths of Gro-
lantor- giants that are confined and starved to the point 
of emaciation before being unleashed during a battle 
or a raid. 
The stench that exudes from a hill giant den might 
attract monstrous scavengers such as oozes, ropers, 
carrion crawlers, or otyughs. Hill giants don't domesti-
cate or tend these creatures but do tolerate their pres-
ence. A visit from a gelatinous cube or a carrion crawler 
probably is the only "housekeeping" a hill giant's den 
ever sees. 
Ghouls are known to lurk around the edges of hill 
giant encampments, but they're less welcome than other 
kinds of scavengers. With their greater craftiness- es-
pecially if they're led by aghast-ghouls can use simple 
trickery to steal the giants' meals. A hill giant wouldn't 
mind if a roper dragged away a few scraps, but it would 
be angry if a trio of ghouls stole an entire carcass. 
STUFF- STUFF 
Hill giants sometimes amuse themselves with inane 
games that typically involve food or eating. One such 
game is called stuff-stuff, in which hill giants see how 
many halflings, gnomes, or goblins they can fit into their 
mouths at once without swallowing. 
STONE GIANTS 
Stone giants- reclusive, reflective, and inscrutable- take 
pains to remain apart from the world of sunlight and 
sky. Only when they're surrounded by stone do they con-
GROLANTOR: ALWAYS HUNCRY, NEVER FU LL 
The deity most revered by hill giants is Grolantor, the least 
of Annam's six sons, the black sheep of the family who was 
scorned by his siblings and his parents. Most ofGrolan-
tor's problems, however, were of his own doing. 
Proud of his great strength (his only redeeming quality), 
Grolantor refused to recognize the superiority of his older, 
smarter, stronger siblings, and insisted on being treated 
as their equal. He complained constantly of his endless 
hunger, but rather than hunt for himself, he snatched food 
from the plates of his siblings and his parents. 
This behavior caused many fights between Grolantor 
and his siblings, most of which Grolantor lost. Tales about 
Grolantor invariably end with his gaining yet another scar 
on his back, received as he escaped the wrath of a family 
member who had been pushed too far by Grolantor's in-
sulting boasts and selfishness. 
sider themselves to be in reality. A world of all-encom-
passing stone is a realm of permanence and solidity, one 
where a lifetime of laborious carving can last through 
countless eons. The surface world, with its shifting 
light, endless sky, changing climate, and eroding wind, 
represents a dream state, an unreality where nothing 
lasts and therefore nothing has significance. 
0RDNING OF ARTISTRY 
Among stone giants, mastery of an art ranks as the 
greatest virtue, and among all the arts, stone carving 
is held in highest regard. Most stone giants spend their 
lives in unending pursuit of the perfect artistic creation. 
Young stone giants practice tirelessly, hoping to prove 
themselves worthy of assisting the tribe's best carvers. 
A stone giant master carver might devote years to find-
ing the best stone before beginning a great work. The 
best carvers are honored as the leaders and shamans of 
the tribe, and their hands are seen as holy- literally be-
coming the hands of Skoraeus Stonebones as they work.
