LIZARDFOLK NAMES 
Lizardfolk take their names from the Draconic lan-
guage. They use simple descriptives granted by the tribe 
based on an individual's notable deeds or actions. For 
example, Garurt translates as "axe," a name given to a 
lizardfolk warrior who defeated an ore and claimed his 
foe's weapon. A lizardfolk who likes to hide in a stand of 
reeds before ambushing an animal might be called Ach-
uak, which means "green" to describe how she blends 
into the foliage. 
Lizardfolk make no distinction between male and fe-
male in their naming conventions. Each example name 
includes its translation in parenthesis.

shra (animal), Darastrix (dragon), Garurt (axe), Irhtos

L IZARDFOLK TRAITS 
Your lizardfolk character has the following racial traits. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score in-
creases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. 
Age. Lizardfolk reach maturity arqund age 14 and 
rarely live longer than 60 years. 
Alignment. Most lizardfolk are neutral. They see the 
world as a place of predators and prey, where life and 
death are natural processes. They wish only to survive, 
and prefer to leave other creatures to their own devices. 
Size. Lizardfolk are a little bulkier and taller than 
humans, and their colorful frills make them appear even 
larger. Your size is Medium. 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you 
have a swimming speed of 30 feet. 
Bite. Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you 
can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you 
deal piercing damage equal to ld6 + your Strength mod-
ifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an 
unarmed strike. 
Cunning Artisan. As part of a short rest, you can har-
vest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, 
monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger 
to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a 
javelin, or ld4 darts or blowgun needles. To use this 
trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate 
artisan's tools, such as leatherworker's tools. 
Hold Breath. You can hold your breath for up to 15 
minutes at a time. 
Hunter's Lore. You gain proficiency with two of the 
following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Na-
ture, Perception, Stealth, and Survival. 
Natural Armor. You have tough, scaly skin. When you 
aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity 
modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine 
your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a 
lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you 
use your natural armor. 
LIZARDFOLK SPEECH 
Lizardfolk can master Common, but their mindset results 
in a speech pattern distim;t from other humanoids. 
Lizardfolk rarely use metaphors. Their sp~h is almost 
always literal. They might pick up idioms, but only with 
some difficulty. 
Names confuse them, unless they are descriptive. They 
tend to apply their own naming conventions to other crea-
tures using Common words. 
Lizardfolk use active verbs to describe the world. A liz, 
ardfolk in cold weather might say, "This wind brings cold" 
rather than "I feel cold." lizardfolk tend to define things in 
terms of actions, rather than effects. 
Hungry Jaws. In battle, you can throw yourself into a 
vicious feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make 
a special attack with your bite. If the attack hits, it deals 
its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points 
(minimum of 1) equal to your Constitution modifier, and 
you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or 
long rest. 
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and Draconic. 
TABAXI 
WE HAD A TABAXI COME THROUGH ONCE, A FEW WINTERS 
back. She kept the taproom packed each night with her sto-
ries and spent most days napping in a chair in front of the 
fireplace. We thought she was lazy, but when Linene came 
around looking/or a missing broach, she was out the door 
before I could blink an eye. 
-Toblen Stonehill, innkeeper 
Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tab-
axi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to collect 
interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay 
eyes on all the world's wonders. Ultimate travelers, the 
inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their 
innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncov-
ered, no treasures or legends lost. 
WANDERING OUTCASTS 
Most tabaxi remain in their distant homeland, content 
to dwell in small, tight clans. These tabaxi hunt for food, 
craft goods, and largely keep to themselves. 
However, not all tabaxi are satisfied with such a life. 
The Cat Lord, the divine figure responsible for the cre-
ation of the tabaxi, gifts each of his children with one 
specific feline trait. Those tabaxi gifted with curiosity 
are compelled to wander far and wide. They seek out 
stories, artifacts, and lore. Those who survive this pe-
riod of wanderlust return home in their elder years to 
share news of the outside world. In this manner, the 
tabaxi remain isolated but never ignorant of the world 
beyond their home. 
BARTERERS OF LORE 
Tabaxi treasure knowledge rather than material things. 
A chest filled with gold coins might be useful to buy food 
or a coil of rope, but it's not intrinsically interesting.
