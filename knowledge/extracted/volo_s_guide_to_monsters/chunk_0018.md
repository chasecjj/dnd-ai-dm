ROLEPLAYING A GIANT 
Giving a giant a personality trait, an ideal, a bond, and 
a flaw helps to create a more vibrant NPC. You can also 
give a character background to a giant. The noble back-
ground, for example, could apply to a cloud giant. 
GIANT PERSONALITY TRAITS 
d8 
PersonalityTrait 
The brutality of my peers is a relic of a bygone era that 
should be stamped out. I seek a more enlightened
path. 
2 
As the most powerful beings in creation, we have a 
duty to use our strength for the benefit of all. 
3 
I take what I want. I don't care who gets hurt. 
4 
A giant lives for a few centuries, but giantkind is 
eternal. Everything I do is to glorify my ancestors and 
make my descendants proud. 
5 
Dragons are my mortal enemies. Everything I do is to 
ensure their destruction. 
6 
I measure a creature's worth by its size. The small 
folk are beneath my concern. 
7 
The small folk are vermin. I enjoy torturing and killing 
them. 
8 
Good or bad, Annam's sons represent the ideals that 
we, as giants, must strive to upho,ld. 
GIANT IDEALS 
d6 
Ideal 
The Ordning. Annam created the ordning for the 
good of all giants, and it's our duty to uphold his vi-
sion. (Lawful) 
2 
Skill. What sets my clan apart is its mastery of our 
traditional crafts. (Good) 
3 
Strength. No other race can match the strength of 
giants, and none should dare to try. (Evil) 
4 
Lordship. Giants are the rightful rulers of the world. 
All will be well when our empire is restored. (Neutral) 
5 
Tribute. The lesser races owe giants not just respect 
but payment of tribute, and what they don't pay will-
ingly, we will take by force. (Chaotic) 
6 
Religion. Of Annam's many sons, none is greater than 
my patron deity. (Any) 
CLOUD GIANTS 
Cloud giants are aptly named, or at least were at one 
time. Few of them live literally on clouds anymore, but 
most do reside atop high mountains, inside or even 
above a near-perpetual cloud layer. A select few-those 
at the apex of the clan's ordning-claim the last of the 
ancient cloud castles that still drift across the sky. 
No one can build those majestic structures any lon-
ger. The methods of their construction were lost (along 
with much other knowledge) when Ostoria fell. Some 
cloud giants believe the information might yet be bur-
ied in some long-forgotten, ruined library. Rumors of

GIANT BONDS 
d6 
Bond 
My clan is the most important influence on my life; 
our collective place in the ordning depends on our 
devotion to one another. 
2 
My clan mates who serve in our deity's temples are 
the closest companions I'll ever know. 
3 
My place in the ordning is ordained by our patron 
deity, and it would be blasphemous to aspire to any-
thing higher or lower. 
4 
Though I can never rise above my clan's position in the 
ordning, I can be a leader among my clan. 
5 
My own kind have turned their backs on me, so 
I make my way among the lesser creatures of the 
world. 
6 
Humans have proven their worth in the world and 
earned a measure of respect from giantkind. 
GIANT FLAWS 
d6 
Flaw 
The ordning is too restrictive for the likes of me. 
2 
The lesser creatures of the world have no souls; they 
exist only to be fodder for the ambitions and appe-
tites of giants. 
3 
Unity among giants is a myth; anyone not of my clan 
is a fair target for my weapons. 
4 
I care nothing for what others expect, to the point 
where I cannot help but contradict what others ask 
ofme. 
5 
I am terrified of arcane magic and can be cowed by 
overt displays ofit. 
6 
Ancient dragons fill me with dread. My knees grow 
weak in their presence. 
its existence crop up from time to time, stirring debate 
and dreams of resurgent glory among the cloud giants, 
but definite information has proven impossible to ob-
tain. Many cloud giants think that someday, a hero will 
unearth this ancient secret. Until then, they must be 
satisfied with watching clouds drift past their moun-
taintop homes instead of living atop those clouds as in 
days of yore. 
FAMILY FIRST 
Most types of giants live communally in large groups 
of clan mates, but the central unit of cloud giant life is 
the family-a mated pair, their offspring (if any), and
