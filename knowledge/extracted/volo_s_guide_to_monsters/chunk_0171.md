YETH HOUND 
Granted by powerful fey to individuals who please them, 
yeth hounds serve evil masters like hunting dogs. Yeth 
hounds fly in pursuit of their prey, often waiting until it 
is too exhausted to fight back. Only the threat of dawn 
drives the pack back into hiding. 
Minions of a Dark Master. A pack of yeth hounds can 
be created by powerful fey such as the Queen of Air and 
Darkness. Once it is brought into existence, a pack must 
have a master, who is often someone the creator wishes 
to reward. The master can telepathically communicate 
with its yeth hounds to give them commands from afar. 
If the master of a pack is killed, the hounds seek and 
choose a new master, typically an individual of great evil 
such as a vampire, a necromancer, or a hag. 
A yeth hound stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder 
and weighs around 400 pounds. Often all that can be 
seen of one in the darkness is the red glow of its eyes 
against its night-black fur. The head of a yeth hound has 
a human-like face, held up by a neck more flexible than a 
dog's. The creature gives off an odor like smoke. 
Sound of Looming Death. Yeth hounds make a 
ghastly baying sound that can be heard all around. Crea-
tures that can see a hound when it bays are filled with 
supernatural fear and usually flee in terror. When a vic-
tim tries to run away, a hound delights in chasing after it 
and tormenting it before bringing the hunt to a close. 
Those that stand their ground and fight back discover 
that mundane weapons partially pass through the 
hound as if it was made of fog, but magic weapons and 
silvered weapons can strike true. 
Foiled by Sunlight. Yeth hounds can't stand sunlight. 
A pack never willingly prolongs a hunt beyond the night 
hours and always seeks to return to its dark den before 
the first rays of dawn. No amount of coercion by a pack's 
master can deter this behavior. If a yeth hound is ex-
posed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into 
the Ethereal Plane, from where its master can retrieve it 
only after the sun has set.

Keen Hearing and Smell. The yeth hound has advantage on 
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. 
Sunlight Banishment. If the yeth hound starts its turn in sun-
light, it is transported to the Ethereal Plane. While sunlight 
shines on the spot from which it vanished, the hound must 
remain in the Deep Ethereal. After sunset, it returns to the 
Border Ethereal at the same spot, whereupon it typically sets 
out to find its pack or its master. The hound is visible on the 
Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, 
but it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane. 
Once it is adjacent to its master or a pack mate that is on the 
Material Plane, a yeth hound in the Border Ethereal can return 
to the Material Plane as an action. 
Telepathic Bond. While the yeth hound is on the same plane of 
existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses 
to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically with 
each other.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, plus 14 (4d6) psychic dam-
age if the target is frightened. 
Baleful Baying. The yeth hound bays magically. Every enemy 
within 300 feet of the hound that can hear it must succeed on 
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end 
of the hound's next turn or until the hound is incapacitated. A 
frightened target that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hound 
must use all its movement on that turn to get as far from the 
hound as possible, must finish the move before taking an ac· 
tion, and must take the most direct route, even if hazards lie 
that way. A target that successfully saves is immune to the bay-
ing of all yeth hounds for the next 24 hours.
