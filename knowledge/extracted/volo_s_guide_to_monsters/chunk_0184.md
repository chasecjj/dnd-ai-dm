KRAKEN PRIEST 
A kraken can seem godlike to folk who have witnessed 
its fury. Those who mistake its might for divine power 
and those who seek to appease the monster through 
veneration are sometimes rewarded with power, to 
serve thereafter as kraken priests. 
The kraken can make itself dimly aware of a kraken 
priest's thoughts if the two are on the same plane of ex-
istence, and it can then push aside the priest's personal-
ity and control it. Kraken priests can thereby act as eyes 
and ears for their masters, and when the kraken has 
something to say, the priest becomes its mouthpiece. 
Every kraken priest undergoes a change in appear-
ance that reflects the kraken's influence, although each 
one differs in how its reverence is displayed. One kraken 
priest might have ink-black eyes and a suckered tentacle 
for a tongue, while another has a featureless face and a 
body covered in eyes and mouths that dribble seawater. 
These horrific manifestations intensify when the kraken 
possesses its minion to utter its dire pronouncements.

MARTIAL ARTS ADEPT 
Martial arts adepts are disciplined monks with exten-
sive training in hand-to-hand combat. Some protect 
monasteries; others travel the world seeking enlighten-
ment or new forms of combat to master. A few become 
bodyguards, trading their combat prowess and loyalty 
for food and lodging. 
MASTER THIEF 
Master thieves are known for perpetrating daring heists. 
They tend to develop a reputation and a cult of personal-
ity. A master thief might "retire" from hands-on work to 
run a thieves' guild, spearhead some covert enterprise, 
or enjoy a quiet life of luxury.
