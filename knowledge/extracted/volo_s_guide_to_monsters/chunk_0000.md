ABOUT THIS BOOK 
Monsters are the heart of this book-where they live, 
how they think, how they might befriend you, and how 
they might harm you. Chapter 1 delves into the stories of 
some of the monstrous groups presented in the Monster 
Manual. Chapter 2 supplements the race options in the 
Player's Handbook, and chapter 3 introduces a host of 
monsters and their stat blocks. Appendix A provides a 
few new beasts, and appendix B is stocked with non­
player characters to populate your D&D adventures. 
Appendix C lets you look up stat blocks in this book by 
challenge rating, creature type, and environment. 
Sprinkled throughout the book are observations and 
musings from two denizens of the Forgotten Realms: 
the legendary explorer Volothamp Geddarm (Volo to 
his friends) and the Archmage of Shadowdale himself, 
El minster Aumar. For the benefit of DMs and players ev­
erywhere, Volo and Elminster share their insights with 
regard to some of the monsters found herein, and their 
words hold a measure of truth regardless of the D&D 
world in which these monsters are met.

ON THE COVER 
Tyler Jacobson illustrates a fateful meeting between a suspicious 
frost giant and a lone adventurer armed with Vo/o's Guide to

diplomacy win the day?
