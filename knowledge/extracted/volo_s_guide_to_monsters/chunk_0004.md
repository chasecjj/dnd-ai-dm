When beholders dream

of beholders,that's
starts.

only from the twisted imagination of a beholder, with 
a set of magical abilities unlike that of its parent. In 
most cases, the process yields one of the three principal 
forms of the beholder: a solitary beholder, a hive, or a 
death tyrant. 
SOLITARY BEHOLDERS 
Most of the beholders in the world live apart from others 
of their kind, and they like it that way. When a solitary 
beholder dreams another beholder into existence, the 
creatures' basic nature often means that the first thing 
they do is try to destroy one another. A solitary beholder 
lairs within a cave system or a ruined structure, either 
one of its own making or a place the creature took over 
after killing or driving off the beholder that gave it birth. 
A solitary beholder gathers (or inherits) inferior crea-
tures that it uses as minions. These creatures help 
defend the lair and also serve as shock troops if the 
beholder vacates its lair to prey on the inhabitants of 
the surrounding area. Often, it plunders its neighbors' 
homes for knowledge and treasure. After the beholder 
secures the spoils it desires from its enemies, it allows 
its minions to divide the remaining booty. 
EYE TYRANTS 
An eye tyrant is a solitary beholder that has suppressed 
its xenophobia and paranoia and chooses to live as the 
leader or ruler of a community or an organization that 
includes other creatures. This doesn't mean that the 
eye tyrant likes, respects, or understands the creatures 
it chooses to associate with, but it does distinguish be-
tween individuals of other races and communicates with 
them on a regular basis. An eye tyrant is still ruthless at 
eliminating threats to itself, whether from another be-
holder or some other powerful creature-it just doesn't 
have an insane fear that any creature not under its 
direct control is working for an enemy. Most known be-
holders who choose to interact with humanoid society in 
any way are eye tyrants
For an example of an eye tyrant 
that leads an organization of humanoids, see the section 
on the Xanathar Guild. 
BEHOLDER HIVES 
In exceedingly rare cases, a beholder might experience 
a dream in which it sees itself in a mirror, or encounters 
several copies of itself, or imagines a sensation akin to 
what humanoids call multiple personalities. At such a 
time, the beholder's dream-birthing creates a beholder 
hive-a group of "newborns" that are identical to its own 
shape but smaller. 
When the dreamer awakens, it treats the newborns as 
extensions of its own self in other bodies, and therefore 
isn't consumed with an urge to kill them. This united 
group of identical beholders doesn't truly have a hive 
intelligence, but their personalities and goals are so 
similar that they can predict and assume each others' 
behavior, much as especially close human siblings can. 
The original beholder is usually the dominant one and 
takes a leadership role. A hive consists of three to ten 
beholders, plus whatever minions they control. 
DEATH TYRANTS 
As a beholder ages, it spends more and more time 
worrying about its mortality. The dreams of such a 
death-fearing beholder might reach into strange corners 
of reality and imagine circumstances in which the crea-
ture can live on after death. When the beholder awak-
ens, it finds itself transformed into a death tyrant. It now 
exists in a state of undeath- yet its fear of being killed 
remains unabated. 
A death tyrant's paranoia about its enemies tends to 
be related to how it fears it will be destroyed, and its 
plans take that fear into account. For example, a death 
tyrant who imagined it would eventually be slain by frost 
giants might relocate its lair to the inside of a volcano, 
send its minions to hunt down all frost giants within 100 
miles, or take some other drastic measure to ensure 
that the fear never becomes reality. 
BEHOLDER- KIN 
The lesser creatures known as beholder-kin bear a 
superficial resemblance to true beholders in that each 
has a floating spherical body with eyes. That's where the 
similarity ends. 
Chapter 3 of this book introduces several new types 
of beholder-kin. A death kiss is usually the result of a 
nightmare about blood, such as what a beholder might 
experience after an encounter with a vampire or after 
being severely wounded in battle. Gazers are "born" out 
of a poisoned or ill beholder's feverish dreams, in which 
its sense of perspective and scale is warped. A specta-
tor (see the Monster Manual) is a kind of lesser beholder 
summoned from another plane of existence to watch
