IMPLACABLE Goos 
Hobgoblins revere two gods unique to their race, the 
only survivors of a pantheon that was decimated by 
Maglubiyet so long ago that hobgoblins don't remember 
the names of the fallen. Nomog-Geaya is the greater of 
the two and the more frequently honored. He is seen as 
a stoic, cold-blooded, and tyrannical leader, and hobgob-
lins believe he expects the same behavior from them. 
Bargrivyek is a god of duty, unity, and discipline, and he 
is thought to be pleased by displays of those principles. 
In the stories that hobgoblins tell one another, Bar-
grivyek serves as Nomog-Geaya's second in command. 
Nomog-Geaya would prefer the position were filled by 
someone more like himself, but Bargrivyek was all he 
was left with after Maglubiyet's conquest. Although 
both deities are ultimately beholden to Maglubiyet, the 
greater god allows them to retain a measure of their in-
fluence over the hobgoblins because their philosophies 
are in line with his own. 
Hobgoblins don't build temples to their gods, lest they 
displease Maglubiyet, but the few priests among them 
do tend small shrines and interpret the body of legends 
about their gods. Nomog-Geaya's priests always wield 
his favored weapons, a longsword and a handaxe. They 
are responsible for martial training as well as instruc-
tion in strategy and battlefield tactics. Bargrivyek's 
priests wield his symbol, a flail with a head dipped in 
white paint. They work as a police force in hobgoblin 
society, making judgments about honor, mediating dis-
putes, and otherwise enforcing discipline. 
RANK, STATUS, AND TITLE 
As in any strict military hierarchy, every hobgoblin in 
a legion has a rank, from the warlord down through a 
cadre of officers to the soldiers that make up most of its 
number. These ranks, using the titles most often applied 
to them, are as follows: 
1st rank: Warlord 
2nd rank: General 
3rd rank: Captain 
4th rank: Fatal Axe 
5th rank: Spear 
6th rank: Fist 
7th rank: Soldier 
A legion is organized into units called banners, each 
one made up of a group of interrelated families. Mem-
bers of a banner live, work, and fight together, and each 
banner has a separate status within the legion that is 
reflected in the power of its officers. For instance, the 
captains of the highest-ranking banners can expect their 
orders to be followed by the captains of any banners of 
lower rank. 
Rank and responsibility aren't necessarily commen-
surate from one legion to another or even between ban-
ners in the same legion. A phalanx of foot soldiers led 
by a captain in one legion might be two hundred strong, 
while in another such a force numbers just twenty. One 
banner might have four warriors mounted on worgs 
led by a fist, while a fist in another banner of the same 
legion might lead ten mounted warriors. If any rank

BLOODY BLUE NOSES 
Hobgoblins are sometimes born with bright red or blue 
noses. This attribute is thought to be a sign of potency and 
potential. Blue- and red-nosed hobgoblins receive prefer-
ential treatment, and as a result they occupy most of the 
leadership positions in hobgoblin society. 
The noses of all hobgoblins become more colorful when 
they are enraged or excited, much the way that humans' 
cheeks can flush with emotion.

nates it from the hierarchy to maximize efficiency. 
HONOR BOUND, BY GLORY CROWNED 
Advancement in rank comes as a result of attaining 
glory, but for the achievement to mean anything, a 
hobgoblin must abide by the race's code of honor 
in doing so. 
Glory can be earned by discovery of great resources 
(such as finding a new vein of iron or a powerful magic 
item), by fine performances (writing and performing 
a great ballad about the legion), by designing and con-
structing a great defense or monument, and through 
other means. But the greatest respect is reserved for 
those who earn their glory in battle. In theory, the 
fortunes of war can elevate the lowest-ranking banner 
in a legion to the highest status. In practice, warlords 
are careful to position themselves and their banners 
to claim the greatest victories in any conflict, and they 
portion out opportunities and responsibilities to other 
banners as politics dictate. 
Each hobgoblin legion has a distinct code of honor 
and law, but all follow a few general precepts that are at 
the heart of the hobgoblin honor system. 
Follow Orders. Carrying out orders without question 
is critical on the battlefield, and hobgoblins follow this 
dictum in peaceful times as well in order to maintain 
stability in their society. Hobgoblins don't shrink from 
following orders that they know will result in death if 
the act will bring glory to the banner or the legion. 
Honor the Gods. Hobgoblins give regular recognition 
to the deities left to them after Maglubiyet's conquest. 
Idols of Nomog-Geaya, as well as standards and flags 
with his image or symbol, receive a bow or salute at all 
times except emergencies. Bargrivyek's peacemakers 
receive due deference regardless of rank or banner 
status. Of course, Maglubiyet's call to conquest is al-
ways answered. 
Suffer nor Give Insult. As befits their warlike nature, 
hobgoblins believe that any insult demands a response. 
Suitably (and somewhat ironically), the outward po-
liteness and civility that they demonstrate among each 
other enables them to avoid conflicts in daily life. This 
same form of "courtesy" is often extended to other races 
the hobgoblins have dealings with, much to the outsid-
ers' surprise. When such respect isn't reciprocated, 
though, relations can swiftly deteriorate. 
Reward Glorious Action. Hobgoblins never deny 
advancement in status to a banner that has earned it, 
nor do they withhold higher rank from a deserving in-
dividual. If a banner attains great glory in battle but is 
nearly destroyed, the handful of members who remain 
are welcomed into another banner, taking their banner's
