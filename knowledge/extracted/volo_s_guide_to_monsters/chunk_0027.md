realms of the storm giants, which maintain a constant 
watch for the all-important signs. In ages past, when 
giant dynasties reigned, the signs that accompanied the 
leader of them all were clear and unmistakable. In the 
crawl of centuries since the empire's collapse, the few 
signs manifested have been muddied, conflicting, and 
contentious. 
For an obvious reason, every storm giant has a strong 
personal interest in how soon Annam's return comes 
to pass- they all want to live to see it. Some individ-
uals gain a measure of immortality for themselves 
by merging with elemental forces. These storm giant 
quintessents are the most reclusive of their kind, lairing 
in remote and inhospitable sites surrounded by brutal 
winds and murderous weather (see chapter 3 for more 
information on these creatures). 
Without an emperor to serve as their political and 
spiritual head, the storm giants are adrift on an uncer-
tain sea. Every possibility encapsulated in every sign is 
exhaustively examined. Debates over the meaning and 
validity of this or that omen are conducted across hu-
man kingdoms and spanning human lifetimes. 
Explorers and adventurers can find opportunity in 
this situation, since the giants sometimes hire agents 
that they dispatch to investigate portents and to retrieve 
items the giants need for their oracles. It's dangerous 
work, for two reasons. The obvious one is that the task 
involves delving into Ostorian ruins that have been 
sealed for millennia. The less obvious one is that certain 
portents, if confirmed to be true, would indeed bring 
about the return of Annam, upending the giants' social 
order and initiating a new age. Some would welcome

such a change; others would oppose it bitterly and do all 
they could to stop it, possibly resorting to all-out war. 
OUT FOR THEMSELVES 
In the absence of both Annam and a worldly emperor, 
storm giants recognize no higher authority. Human, elf, 
and dwarf kings, liches, grand sorcerers and wizards-
all might amass what they consider great power, but 
they have no influence over the storm giants. Any who 
try extending their reach in that direction are guaran-
teed to come to grief. 
But as long as the world leaves the storm giants alone, 
the giants will leave the world alone. They wish neither 
good nor ill on the realms of humanity; they simply don't 
give much thought to the matter, except on the rare 
occasions when humans crop up in a prophecy or are 
hinted at by an omen. 
When storm giants do interact with non-giants, those 
on the receiving end of their attention might question 
the notion that storm giants are "good" creatures. They 
respect the principle of the sanctity of life, but even the 
calmest of storm giants has a tremendous temper. When 
one is roused to anger, principle gives way to fury, and 
an offense committed by one person against a giant can 
bring furious retribution down on an entire community. 
A storm giant that destroys a town and kills innocents 
in a fit of rage is likely to regret it afterward and might 
offer payment to make amends, though a sack of gold is 
likely little comfort to those who lost loved ones, homes, 
and livelihoods. It's always wise to tread softly, speak 
deferentially, and act respectfully in the presence of a 
giant, but this is especially true of storm giants.
