routes and who is responsible for blocking tunnels to 
deter pursuit. 
Kobolds feel a cool affinity or something like kinship 
for other members of their tribe, but they are rarely af-
fectionate with each other. Two kobolds who've known 
each other for over a decade might consider each other 
friends or enemies, but the strength of this sentiment 
is much fainter than any comparable human emotion. 
Since most of their waking time is spent working, ad-
versarial kobolds rarely have opportunities to exchange 
insults, let alone come to blows over their differences. 
Kobolds choose mates primarily for convenience. 
Their lack of emotional bonding means they have no 
concept of marriage or permanent family relationships. 
Their eggs are placed in a common tribal hatchery with 
no effort to keep track of who each one's mother is. This 
practice and the communal raising of the hatch lings 
mean that the tribe operates like a group of cousins. 
Because they lay eggs, and the eggs don't require 
much tending, kobold females aren't exempted from 
war or work. Furthermore, kobolds can slowly change 
sex. If most males or females of a tribe are killed, some 
survivors change over several months until the tribe is 
balanced again. In this way, the tribe can quickly repop-
ulate with just a few survivors. Because of these factors, 
kobolds don't have assigned gender roles for young or 
adults. A leader, sorcerer, miner, or crafter is as likely to 
be female as male. 
GROW FAST, DIE EARLY 
Kobolds grow and mature much more swiftly than 
members of other humanoid races. At 6 years old a ko-
bold is considered an adult. Most succumb to violence, 
accidents, or disease by age 20, but a kobold can live for 
up to 120 years-a longevity they attribute to being dis-
tantly related to dragons. A female can lay up to six eggs 
per year, and an egg matures for two to three months 
before it hatches. 
Kobolds don't engage in funeral ceremonies; a dead 
kobold's body is burned or disposed of in some other 
convenient way (or, in a cannibalistic tribe, eaten). Ko-
bolds believe that if they die in service to their tribe, 
Kurtulmak immediately sends each of them back to life 
as the next egg laid in the hatchery. If a particularly im-
portant or respected member of a tribe dies, the hatch-
ery is closely monitored. The next egg laid is immedi-
ately separated from the rest and carefully protected. 
Once it hatches, the resultant young kobold is groomed 
to fill a position of importance. 
FOOD AND CANNIBALISM 
Although their sharp teeth would suggest they are car-
nivores, kobolds are actually omnivores, and can eat 
just about anything, including meat, fruit, tree bark, 
bone, leather, and eggshells (a newly hatched kobold's 
first meal is usually its own shell). A hungry tribe leaves 
nothing behind from a kill, eating everything that's edi-
ble and using the rest to make tools or adornments. 
Kobolds shed teeth as they wear out and grow new 
ones their entire lives. Many wear their own shed teeth 
as jewelry, with more teeth indicating an older- and 
wiser-kobold. Some unscrupulous individuals wear

teeth stolen or harvested from others in an attempt to 
make them seem older and more respectable. 
Most kobold tribes avoid eating what they call "talking 
meat" -intelligent creatures-because such behavior 
prompts retaliation. The fear of starvation can make 
them flexible about this principle, however, and if their 
options are either attacking such creatures or going 
hungry, kobolds are practical. A few tribes, particularly 
those in lightly populated areas, practice cannibalism, 
believing it is foolish to waste good meat. 
In any case, kobolds that eat humanoids don't simply 
start consuming corpses or prisoners right after a bat-
tle; they're more inclined to tie their victims to saplings 
and slowly roast them over a fire, or put them in a giant 
cook pot to make stew. Fortunately for the prisoners, the 
kobolds' almost comedic preparations sometimes give 
rescuers time to locate and free the captives before the 
kobolds settle down for the main course. 
HATRED 
Because the gnome god Gari Glittergold trapped the 
kobold god Kurtulmak in an inescapable maze, kobolds 
are bitterly hateful toward gnomes. Although they usu-
ally don't seek out gnomes to do them violence, if hostile 
kobolds encounter a mixed group of gnomes and other 
humanoids, the kobolds instinctively attack the gnomes. 
Kobolds in battle with gnomes are much less likely to 
run away because their hatred overrules their sense of 
self-preservation. 
A kobold's cautious nature doesn't mean it can't get 
angry. The blood of dragons flows in its veins, and like 
a raging drake, a kobold that is pushed too far or has its 
back against the wall can become a miniature storm of 
fangs and claws as it desperately tries to defend its life. 
Likewise, kinship to their own tribe can prompt kobolds 
to battle another kobold tribe for resources or territory. 
Such conflicts aren't common, because two tribes will 
always prefer to expand in different directions if they 
come into contact, but they do happen. 
For example, two neighboring tribes that want exclu-
sive claim to a flock of mountain goats might skirmish 
with each other every few days. Eventually the leader of 
one warring tribe realizes it is losing due to attrition and 
moves its tribe to another area, ceding the contested ter-
ritory to its more successful neighbors. 
As demonstrated by their hatred of gnomes, kobolds 
have a persecution complex and easily take offense at 
the actions or deeds of other races. They aren't forgiving 
of other races, and they enjoy nursing their hatred until 
they get a chance to wreak revenge on a creature or a 
race that has wronged them.
