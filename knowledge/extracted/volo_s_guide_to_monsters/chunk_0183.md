them equal to 1 + the spell's level. These creatures automati-

cessful save means a chosen creature would take half damage 
from the spell, it instead takes no damage from it.

EVOKER 
Evokers are specialist wizards who harness magical 
energy and elemental forces to destroy. Many tend to 
be hotheaded and aggressive. Others are cold and re-
served, unleashing their power at just the right moment 
to exploit an opponent's weakness. 
ILLUSIONIST 
Illusionists are specialist wizards who twist light, 
sound, shadow, and even minds to create false and 
quasi-real effects. They can be flamboyant and use their 
powers in spectacular and obvious ways, or quiet and 
subtle, using their magic to conceal the truth.
