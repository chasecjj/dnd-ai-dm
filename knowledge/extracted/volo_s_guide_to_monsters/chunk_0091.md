Non-kenku use names that refer to the sound made or 
the animal a kenku mimics, such as Rat Scratch, Whis-
tler, Mouser, and Growler. 
Some kenku turn their back on crime to pursue legiti-
mate trades. These kenku adopt noises made as part of 
their craft. A sailor duplicates the sound of a fluttering 
sail, while a smith mimics the clanging of a hammer 
on metal. Non-kenku describe these folk by their trade 
sounds, such as Sail Snap, Hammerer, and Cutter. 
KENKU TRAITS 
Your kenku character has the following racial traits. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in-
creases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. 
Age. Kenku have shorter lifespans than humans. They 
reach maturity at about 12 years old and can live to 60. 
Alignment. Kenku are chaotic creatures, rarely mak-
ing enduring commitments, and they care mostly for 
preserving their own hides. They are generally chaotic 
neutral in outlook. 
Size. Kenku are around 5 feet tall and weigh between 
90 and 120 pounds. Your size is Medium. 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Expert Forgery. You can duplicate other creatures' 
handwriting and craftwork. You have advantage on all 
checks made to produce forgeries or duplicates of exist-
ing objects. 
Kenku Trainil1ll. You are proficient in your choice 
of two of the following skills: Acrobatics, Deception, 
Stealth, and Sleight of Hand. 
Mimicry. You can mimic sounds you have heard, 
including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you 
make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wis-
dom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Decep-
tion) check. 
Languages. You can read and write Common and Au-
ran, but you can speak only by using your Mimicry trait. 
ROLEPLAYINC A KENKU 
If you're playing a kenku, constant attempts to mimic 
noises can come across as confusing or irritating rather 
than entertaining. You can just as easily describe the 
sounds your character makes and what they mean. Be 
clear about your character's intentions unless you're delib-
erately aiming for inscrutable or mysterious. 
You might say, "Snapper makes the noise of a hammer 
slowly and rhythmically tapping a stone to show how 
bored he is. He plays with his dagger and studies the 
Lords' Alliance agent sitting at the bar." Creating a vo-
cabulary of noises for the other players to decode might 
sound like fun, but it can prove distracting and could slow 
down the game. 
LIZARD FOLK 
IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING TAKING A SCALED ONE ALONG 
on an adventure, remember this important fact. The 
strange, inhuman glint in its eyes as it looks you over is the 
same look you might give a freshly grilled steak. 
- Tordek, dwarf fighter and adventurer 
Only a fool looks at the lizardfolk and sees nothing more 
than scaly humanoids. Their physical shape notwith-
standing, lizardfolk have more in common with iguanas 
or dragons than they do with humans, dwarves, or elves. 
Lizardfolk possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, 
their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of 
basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. 
Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of miles 
from the nearest human settlement, but the gap be-
tween their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins 
is far greater. 
Despite their alien outlook, some lizardfolk make an 
effort to understand and, in their own manner, befriend 
people of other races. Such lizardfolk make faithful and 
skilled allies. 
ALIEN MINDS 
The lizardfolk's reptilian nature comes through not 
only in their appearance, but also in how they think and 
act. Lizardfolk experience a more limited emotional life 
than other humanoids. Like most reptiles, their feelings 
largely revolve around fear, aggression, and pleasure. 
Lizardfolk experience most feelings as detached 
descriptions of creatures and situations. For example, 
humans confronted by an angry troll experience fear on 
a basic level. Their limbs shake, their thinking becomes 
panicked and jumbled, and they react by instinct. The 
emotion of fear takes hold and controls their actions. 
In contrast, lizardfolk see emotions as traits assigned 
to other creatures, objects, and situations. A lizardfolk 
doesn't think, "I'm scared." Instead, aggressive, stronger 
creatures register to the lizardfolk as fearsome beings 
to be avoided if possible. If such creatures attack, liz-
ardfolk flee, fighting only if cornered. Lizardfolk aren't 
scared of a troll; instead, they understand that a troll is a 
fearsome, dangerous creature and react accordingly. 
Lizardfolk never become angry in the way others do, 
but they act with aggression toward creatures that they 
could defeat in a fight and that can't be dealt with in 
some other manner. They are aggressive toward prey 
they want to eat, creatures that want to harm them, 
and so on. 
Pleasurable people and things make life easier for 
lizardfolk. Pleasurable things should be preserved and 
protected, sometimes at the cost of the lizardfolk's own 
safety. The most pleasurable creatures and things are 
ones that allow lizardfolk to assess more situations as 
benign rather than fearsome.
