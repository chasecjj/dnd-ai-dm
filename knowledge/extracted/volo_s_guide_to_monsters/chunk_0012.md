holder (or any parts it can recover from a battle) would 
certainly be a prized trophy, as would be the skull of a 
defeated dragon, the clothing of a famous adventurer 
the beholder killed, or art objects that are pleasing to its 
alien senses. A beholder usually has the location of all 
its trophies memorized and immediately senses if some-
thing is missing or out of place. 
Clutter is treasure that has intrinsic value, but isn't 
immediately useful to the beholder or its minions. This 
category includes currency, gems, jewelry, and magic 
items that nobody in the lair can use or use well. These 
items are stored somewhere in the lair until they're dis-
posed of- sometimes by distributing them among the 
minions as gifts, other times by disintegration. 
A beholder's personality greatly influences how it 
categorizes its treasures. A braggart beholder might 
use a slain enemy's magic battleaxe as a trophy, but a 
manipulative beholder might give that axe as a gift to a 
lieutenant in order to encourage competition between its 
upper ranks. An inventive beholder might use an ever-
smoking bottle to obscure dozens of pit traps in a room, 
but a more militaristic one might not have a use for it 
and treat it as clutter. Circumstances might change the 
role of a piece of treasure- a staff of the python used to 
prop up a stone block trap might be given as a gift if the 
beholder acquires a minion who can attune the item. 
MINIONS AND PETS 
Beholders often make use of minions. Establishing con-
trol over these creatures usually involves the use of its 
eye rays, but eventually the minions come to understand 
that the beholder can kill them whenever it wants and it 
is in their best interest to stop resisting and just obey the 
beholder's orders. 
Minions build walls in the beholder's lair, distribute 
food to other residents, and carve out new living spaces 
for themselves and other minions-tasks that the be-
holder considers beneath its personal attention. Some 
even worship the beholder as an angry, capricious deity. 
Three tables- Beholder Lesser Minions, Beholder 
Greater Minions, and Beholder Pets- make it easy to 
stock a beholder's lair with such creatures. 
LESSER MINIONS 
If a beholder's retinue were likened to an army, the 
grunts would be represented by its lesser minions, in-
telligent creatures that can talk and usually live in large 
groups. They handle menial tasks for the beholder such 
as hunting, scouting, and guarding the lair. 
GREATER MINIONS 
A beholder's greater minions are formidable opponents. 
In the lair, they might be stationed where they can catch 
intruders in an ambush, or they could be a last line of 
defense against foes that threaten the inner sanctum. 
PETS 
A beholder often has one or more pets in its lair, mainly 
because (for whatever reason) it enjoys the company of 
such creatures. Pets are usually of low intelligence and 
are kept around because of their combat abilities, enter-
tainment value, or trophy status.
