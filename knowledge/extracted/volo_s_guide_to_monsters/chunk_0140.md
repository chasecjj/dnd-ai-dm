KORRED 
Korreds are unpredictable, secretive fey with strong 
ties to earth and stone. Because of their magical hair 
and their mystical understanding of minerals, they are 
sought after by treasure-hunters, dwarves, and others 
that desire wealth beneath the earth. 
Earthy Fey. Korreds prefer to keep their own com-
pany and occasionally consort with creatures of ele-
mental earth such as galeb duhr. A tribe of korreds 
gathers weekly to perform ceremonial dances, beating 
out rhythms on stone with their hooves and clubs. In the 
depths of the Material Plane, korreds typically flee from 
other creatures but become aggressive when they feel 
insulted or are annoyed by the sounds of mining. 
Stone Sympathy. No one knows the ways of stone 
and earth better than a korred. Korreds can seemingly 
smell veins of metal or gems. A korred on the surface 
can feel the rise and fall of bedrock under the earth and 
where caves lie, and underground it knows the path-
ways through the stone for miles. Secret doors that lead 
through stone are as obvious as windows to a korred. 
Korreds can hurl boulders far larger than it seems 
they should be able to, shape stone as though it were 
clay, swim through rock, and summon earth elemen-
tals and other creatures. They also gain supernatural 
strength just from standing on the ground. 
Enchanted Hair. Korreds have hair all over their bod-
ies, but the hair that grows from their heads is magical. 
When cut, it transforms into whatever material was 
used to cut it. Korreds use iron shears to cut lengths of 
their hair, then weave the strands together to create iron 
ropes that they can manipulate, animating them to bind 
or snake around creatures and objects. Korreds take 
great pride in their hair, and equally great offense at any-
one who attempts to cut it without permission.

Command Hair. The korred has at least one SO-foot-long rope 
woven out of its hair. As a bonus action, the korred commands 
one such rope within 30 feet of it to move up to 20 feet and 
entangle a Large or smaller creature that the korred can see. 
The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or 
become grappled by the rope (escape DC 13). Until this grapple 
ends, the target is restrained. The korred can use a bonus ac-
tion to release the target, which is also freed if the korred dies 
or becomes incapacitated. 
A rope ofkorred hair has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 
l hit point at the start of each of the korred's turns while it has 
at least l hit point and the korred is alive. If the rope drops to 0 
hit points, it is destroyed. 
Innate Spellcasting. The korred's innate spellcasting ability is 
Wisdom (save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, 
requiring no components: 
At will: commune with nature, meld into stone, stone shape 
1/day each: conjure elemental (as 6th-level spell; galeb 
duhr, gargoyle, earth elemental, or xorn only), Otto's irre-
sistible dance 
Stone Camouflage. The korred has advantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky terrain. 
Stone's Strength. While on the ground, the korred deals 2 
extra dice of damage with any weapon attack (included in 
its attacks). 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The korred makes two attacks with its greatclub 
or hurls two rocks. 
Greatc/ub. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 10 (ld8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, or 19 (3d8 + 6) 
bludgeoning damage if the korred is on the ground. 
Rock. Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 60/120 ft., one 
target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, or 24 (4d8 + 6) 
bludgeoning damage if the korred is on the ground.
