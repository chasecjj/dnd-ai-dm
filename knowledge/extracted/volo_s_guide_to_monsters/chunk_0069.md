Eyes ofGruumsh. A few of the ores touched by the 
power of Gruumsh are given the ultimate honor of 
carrying a small part of the god's overwhelming rage 
into battle, in the form of magic that augments their 
weapons and helps the tribe succeed. To become an eye 
of Gruumsh, an ore that has been chosen by Gruumsh 
must gouge out one of its eyes as a sign of devotion, 
sacrificing half of its mortal vision in return for divine 
power. These god-touched ores are revered as living 
connections to Gruumsh, and are treated with respect 
even when they are old and infirm. 
ILNEVAL, "THE WAR MAKER" 
Ilneval is the loyal right hand of Gruumsh. He is the god 
who plans the attacks and devises the strategies that 
allow the forces of Gruumsh to dominate the battle and 
fill their war wagons with plunder and severed heads. Il-
neval stands with his bloody sword, calling to those who 
understand the ebb and flow of combat to sit around his 
council fire and learn the ways of warfare. 
Skilled Strategists. Ores that show aptitude for the 
nuances of warfare at an early age are considered cho-
sen by Ilneval and are groomed to serve as blades of 
Ilneval. These individuals are battle captains that follow 
the orders of the tribe's chief, leading a portion of the 
tribe's warriors into the thick of battle and bringing a 
measure of strategy to the assault. Blades of Ilneval are 
fearsome opponents, seeming to have an uncanny sense 
of when to move and when to strike, able to exploit the 
weakness of their enemy like a pack of hungry wolves. 
BAHGTRU, "THE LEG BREAKER" 
Despite the influence ofllneval, ores are and will forever 
be brutal and feral in how they wage war. Bahgtru is the 
deity who epitomizes the physical might and ruthless-
ness that ores use to overwhelm their foes. He is the one 
who drives every thrust of an ore's weapon, so that it 
does as much harm as possible. 
Fearless and Mighty. In the myths, it is said that 
Bahgtru was out hunting when he was surprised by the 
mightiest of the behirs, one with hundreds of legs. In a 
flash, Bahgtru was wrapped in the creature's coils and 
gripped by its legs. No one had ever escaped the grasp 
of the behir, but Bahgtru saw this as the ultimate test 
of his strength, and laughed at his good fortune. One by 
one, Bahgtru broke the behir's legs, and freed himself 
from its clutches. The creature's shrieks became the 
lightning of the storm, and its broken femur became the 
symbol of Bahgtru's followers, reminding them that any-
thing can be broken and defeated by superior strength. 
Competing in Cruelty. Most young ores that an 
explorer or an adventurer might encounters are fol-
lowers of Bahgtru. Ores of Bahgtru continually try to 
prove their superior strength and endurance through 
cruel contests against their tribe mates, acts of unpro-
voked belligerence, and great success in battle. It is 
through these tests of strength that Bahgtru's followers 
prove which among them will eventually be worthy of 
Gruumsh's unwavering gaze. 
The Sacred BuJJ. Ores of Bahgtru sometimes enter 
battle astride aurochs, large creatures that resemble
