HAGS 
Hags delight in bringing ruin and misery to the world. 
Malevolence is such a core part of a hag that it shapes 
her physical form and molds her magical powers. 
ANNIS HAG 
Annis hags lair in mountains or hills. Despite being 
hunchbacked and hump-shouldered, they are the largest 
and most physically imposing of their kind, standing 
eight feet tall. 
Tormenting the Weak. Although annis hags can eas-
ily tear a grown man apart, they love hunting children, 
preferring their flesh above all others. They use the 
flayed skin of such victims to make supple leather, and a 
hag's lair often shows the signs of this industry. 
Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges 
of forests and other areas they claim. In this way, they 
provoke fear and paranoia in nearby villages and settle-
ments. To an annis hag, nothing is sweeter than turning 
a vibrant community into a place paralyzed with terror, 
where folk never venture out at night, strangers are met 
with suspicion and anger, and parents warn their chil-
dren to "be good, or the annis will get you." 
Child Corrupter. When an annis feels especially 
cruel, she disguises herself as a kindly-looking elderly 
woman, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives 
it an iron token that it can use to confide in her. Over 
time, "Granny" convinces the child that it's okay to have 
bad thoughts and do bad deeds-starting with breaking 
things or wandering outside without permission, then 
graduating to pushing someone down the stairs or set-
ting a house on fire. Sooner or later, the child's family 
and community become terrified of the "bad seed" and 
must face the awful decision of whether the child should 
be punished or exiled. 
Tribe Mother. Much in the way that they befriend 
children in order to corrupt them, annis hags have a 
tendency for adopting a group of ogres, trolls, or other 
loutish creatures, ruling them through brute strength, 
verbal abuse, and superstition. 
Covens. An annis hag that is part of a coven (see the 
"Hag Covens" sidebar in the Monster Manual) has a 
challenge rating of 8 (3,900 XP). 
IRON TOKEN 
An annis hag can pull out one of her iron teeth or nails and 
spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of 
a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror. Thereafter, any creature that 
holds this iron token can have a whispered conversation 
with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are on the 
same plane of existence and within 10 miles of each other. 
The holder of the token can hear only the hag's voice, not 
those of any other creatures or any ambient noise around 
the hag. Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token 
and not the noise around it. 
A hag can have up to three iron tokens active at one time. 
As an action, she can discern the direction and approxi-
mate distance to all of her active tokens. She can instan-
taneously deactivate any of her tokens at any distance (no 
action required), whereupon the token retains its current 
form but loses its magical properties.
