LAIR ACTIONS 
When fighting inside its lair, a morkoth can invoke the 
ambient magic of the island to take lair actions. On ini-
tiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the morkoth takes 
a lair action to cause one of the effects described below: 
• The morkoth uses its Hypnosis action, originating at a 
point within 120 feet of itself. It doesn't need to see the 
effect's point of origin. 
• The morkoth casts darkness, dispel magic, or misty 
step, using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability and 
without expending a spell slot. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The island surrounding a morkoth's lair is warped by 
the creature's presence, creating the following effects: 
• The morkoth is aware of any new arrival, whether an 
object or a creature, on its island or in its sanctum. 
As an action, the morkoth can locate any one creature 
or object on the island. Visitors to the island feel as 
though they are being watched, even when they aren't. 
• Each time a creature that has been on the island for 
less than a year finishes a short or long rest, it must 
make a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On 
a failure, the creature has misplaced one possession 
(chosen by the player, if the creature is that player's 
character). The possession remains nearby but con-

ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The morkoth makes three attacks: two with its 
bite and one with its tentacles or three with its bite. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage. 
Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one 
target. Hit: 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target 
is grappled (escape DC 14) ifit is a Large or smaller creature. 
Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 
15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the 
morkoth's turns, and the morkoth can't use its tentacles on 
another target. 
Hypnosis. The morkoth projects a 30-foot cone of magical 
energy. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the 
morkoth for l minute. While charmed in this way, the target 
tries to get as close to the morkoth as possible, using its ac-
tions to Dash until it is within 5 feet of the morkoth. A charmed 
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself 
on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the 
effect ends for it, the creature has advantage on saving throws 
against the morkoth's Hypnosis for 24 hours. 
REACTIONS 
Spell Reflection. If the morkoth makes a successful saving 
throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the morkoth 
can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can 
see within 120 feet ofit. The spell targets the chosen creature 
instead of the morkoth. If the spell forced a saving throw, the 
chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, 
the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.

cealed for a short time, so it can be recovered with a 
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. An ob-
ject that is misplaced but not recovered ends up in the 
morkoth's lair 1 hour later. If the creature later goes to 
the morkoth's lair, its lost possessions stand out in its 
perception and are easily recovered. 
Entrances to the morkoth's lair have an enchantment 
that the morkoth can activate or suppress at any time 
while it's in its lair and not incapacitated. Any creature 
within 30 feet of such an entrance and able to see it 
must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed 
save, the creature feels an intense urge to use its 
movement on each of its turns to enter the lair and to 
move toward the morkoth's location (the target doesn't 
realize it's heading toward a creature). The target 
moves toward the morkoth by the most direct route. 
As soon as it can see the morkoth, the target can re-
peat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. It can also repeat the saving throw at the end 
of each of its turns and every time it takes damage. 
• With a thought (no action required), the morkoth can 
initiate a change in the water within its lair that takes 
effect 1 minute later. The water can be as breathable 
and clear as air, or it can be normal water (ranging in 
clarity from murky to clear). 
If the morkoth dies, these regional effects end 
immediately.
