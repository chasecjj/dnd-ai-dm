KOBOLDS: LITTLE DRAGONS 
Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and 
weak, but these little reptilian creatures actually have 
a strong social structure that stresses devotion to the 
tribe, are clever with their hands, and viciously work to-
gether in order to overcome their physical limitations. 
In the kobolds' version of a perfect world, the crea-
tures would be left alone to dig their tunnels and raise 
the next generation of kobolds, all the while seeking 
the magic that will free their imprisoned god (see the 
"Kurtulmak: God of Ko bolds" sidebar). In the world they 
occupy, kobolds are often bullied and enslaved by larger 
creatures-or, when they live on their own, they are con-
stantly fearful of invasion and oppression. Although in-
dividually they are timid and shy away from conflict, ko-
bolds are dangerous if cornered, vicious when defending 
their eggs, and notorious for the dangerous improvised 
traps they use to protect their warrens. 
EXPERT T'uNNELERS 
Kobolds are naturally skilled at tunneling. Similar to 
dwarves, they seem to have a near-instinctive sense of 
what sections of stone or earth are strong or weak, are 
bearing a load or are safe to excavate, or are likely to 
contain minerals or offer access to water. This ability 
enables them to fashion secure homes in places where 
other creatures wouldn't feel safe. 
Kobolds take advantage of their size by creating 
small-diameter tunnels that they can easily pass 
through, but that require larger creatures to hunch 
over or even crawl to make progress. In places where a 
tunnel opens into a chasm and continues on the other 
side, the kobolds might connect the two passages with a 
rope bridge or some other rickety structure, designed to 
collapse under the weight of any creature heavier than 
a kobold. On occasion, the route through a kobold lair 
runs along a ledge that borders a cavern or a crevasse, 
and the kobolds might erect a railing or a wall that pre-
vents them from falling off the edge-high enough to 
protect a kobold but low enough to serve as a tripping 
hazard for a larger creature. 
Those of other humanoid races have little good to say 
about kobolds, but they do admit that the little reptilians 
do respectable tunnel work using simple tools. If a band 
of kobolds is enslaved by more powerful creatures, the 
kobolds are usually put to work enlarging their masters' 
living area and protecting vital areas of the lair with 
traps and other defenses. 
Some human communities hire kobolds to dig their 
sewer tunnels, paying them with food and tools the 
kobolds wouldn't have access to on their own. If they 
are treated well and left alone to do the job, the kobolds 
work industriously and build a network of passages be-
neath the streets, connecting them to a nearby waterway 
and greatly improving the town's sanitation. If the ko-
bolds like the area and aren't mistreated by the humans, 
they might build a warren and make a permanent home 
there, while continuing to expand the town's sewers as 
the community grows. These so-called "city kobolds" 
live underground but might make occasional nighttime 
forays up to the surface. Roughly one quarter of the 
towns and cities in the world have kobold communities 
living under them, but the kobolds are so good at staying 
hidden that the surface-dwelling citizens in the area of-
ten don't know what lies beneath them. 
Because the kobolds make sure they stay out of the 
way of anyone more dangerous than themselves, grow 
their own subterranean food, and prefer to sneak about 
at night, the people of a town might go for weeks or 
months without noticing evidence that kobolds are in 
the area, and years between actual sightings. 
ABLE SCAVENGERS 
Kobolds are adept at identifying broken, misplaced, 
discarded, or leftover crafted items from other creatures 
that can still be put to use. They prefer to scavenge ob-
jects that have clearly been lost or thrown away, which is 
easy to do without attracting attention. At the same time, 
they don't automatically shy away from trying to grab 
items that are the property of other creatures, because 
such objects are more likely to be in good condition and 
thus more useful or valuable. 
When they go after items that aren't free for the tak-
ing, kobolds try to remain undetected and don't give 
their targets reason to harm them. For example, a group 
of city kobolds might sneak into a cobbler's house at 
night to loot it of knives, leather bits, nails, and other 
useful items, but if they are at risk of discovery, they run 
away rather than attack anyone in the house. By fleeing 
before they can be seen or identified, they avoid getting 
into a situation where the townsfolk would try to hunt 
down all kobolds and put the tribe's survival at risk. 
Some aggressive individual kobolds and tribes do 
exist, but in general kobolds don't purposely provoke 
retaliatory attacks from the creatures they steal from. 
It's better to be cautious and overlooked than to be con-
sidered dangerous and a threat. 
In a couple of situations, kobolds might abandon 
this careful approach. First, because of their hatred of 
gnomes, city kobolds often go out of their way to target 
gnomes' houses and shops. Even in such cases, the 
kobolds' fear of retaliation usually prevents them from 
trying to directly harm the gnomes, but they might spit 
in the milk, balance dishes on tables so they're easily 
knocked over and broken, or scatter sewing needles all 
over the floor-petty, vengeful acts that humiliate, injure, 
or anger the gnomes, but not so much that the gnomes 
want to hunt down and kill the kobolds. Because of the 
kobolds' animosity, gnomes tend to avoid or abandon 
settlements that have a severe infestation of kobolds, 
and conversely kobolds are usually driven out of com-
munities that have a large gnome population. 
Second, kobolds are always on the lookout for magic 
that might help them free their imprisoned god, Kurtul-
mak. Typical kobolds don't know how to use a wand, a 
spellbook, or anything with more magical power than 
a potion, but they all believe that the tribal sorcerer can 
figure out how to use any such item they come across. 
When kobolds sense an opportunity to separate a magic 
item from its owner, they are often willing to take the 
chance of revealing themselves because the potential 
reward is worth the risk.
