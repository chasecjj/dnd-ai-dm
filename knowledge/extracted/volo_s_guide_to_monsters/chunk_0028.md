LIVING ON THE EDGE 
Once they're old enough to fend for themselves, storm 
giants spend most of their lives in contemplative isola-
tion. Storm giants are capable of living wherever they 
choose, whether that's atop a mountain, in a glacial 
cave, or at the bottom of the deepest oceanic trench. 
One kind of location that invariably draws their attention 
is an elemental crossing-where the Material Plane and 
the Elemental Planes intersect and interact. Elemental 
influence pervades the architecture of storm giants and 
lends a tempestuous, unearthly quality to their homes. 
Storm giants use elemental crossings for their own 
transplanar wandering, especially into the Elemental 
Plane of Air and the Elemental Plane of Water. The 
frequent whirlpools, tornadoes, and lashing rainstorms 
that buffet the passages to those two planes help to safe-
guard the giants' homes and ensure their privacy. 
Although a storm giant prefers to live outside the 
company of other giants, it isn't necessarily alone in its 
stronghold. Storm giants share their abodes with other 
creatures that are comfortable in the environment: a 
sea-dwelling storm giant, for example, might have a 
few merfolk, water weirds, or even a dragon turtle for 
companions, while a storm giant living on a mountain 
peak would extend a friendly hand to any pegasus that 
happened by, and might even welcome yetis into its 
home for a time if it believed they could be trusted. The 
giant's guests are expected to be respectful, to make 
themselves useful, and to provide interesting conver-
sation or other entertainment when the giant feels like 
being sociable. 
G NOLLS: THE INSATIABLE 
HUNGER 
Gnolls remind the world of the horrors posed by the 
hordes of the Abyss, and the damage that even the brief-
est demonic incursion can inflict on the world. 
Whenever the demon lord Yeenoghu enters the Mate-
rial Plane and goes on a rampage, he leaves a great trail 
of corpses in his wake. As the Lord of Savagery despoils 
the land, packs of hyenas trail him and feast on the vic-
tims until the dead flesh ofYeenoghu's prey leave them 
bloated and unable to move. Then, in a shower of blood 
and gristle, the hyenas transform into gnolls, which take 
up Yeenoghu's awful mission to kill and destroy any-
thing in their path. 
YEENOGHU 
Gnolls embody the dark urges of Yeenoghu, the demon 
lord of slaughter and senseless destruction. Although 
Yeenoghu has been defeated and cast back into the 
Abyss more than once, gnolls continue to pursue his 
horrid, apocalyptic vision of a world transformed into a 
barren, empty ruin, with only the decaying corpses of 
the last few surviving gnolls left to mark its passing. 
As creatures that sprang up in the wake of a demon 
lord, gnolls are creatures of savage blood lust, incapable 
of understanding or acting on any other impulse. They 
are extensions ofYeenoghu's will. They pause only to

devour what they have killed, and to fashion crude weap-
ons and armor from their victims' corpses. 
A gnoll war band exemplifies Yeenoghu's plans for the 
world. He wants to transform it into a vicious realm of 
endless fighting. When the last battle ends, Yeenoghu 
will enter the world, slay its last surviving champion, 
and preside over a wasteland of rotting corpses. To Yee-
noghu, pure destruction is beauty. 
THE GIFT OF YEENOGHU 
Yeenoghu imparts to the minds of his followers an un-
quenchable, supernatural hunger, both for violence and 
for the flesh of intelligent creatures. A gnoll feels a con-
stant, gnawing demand for blood and destruction that 
abates only when it kills and eats intelligent creatures. 
Other prey might provide temporary sustenance, but it 
does nothing to quell Yeenoghu's hunger. 
INSIDE THE MIND OF A GNOLL 
From a journal recovered from a slain cultist ofYeenoghu: 
Day 2: The subject continues to growl and struggle, de-
spite the removal of its arms and legs. I will let it starve for 
a few days to weaken its mental fortitude. If the gnoll does 
have some sort of tie to the Abyss, I must keep my focus 
on exploiting that link, even though the creature's mind 
might remain aware. 
Day 6: No appreciable loss of vigor. 
Day 11: Still no appreciable loss of vigor. 
Day 13: Ritual must commence tomorrow despite sub-
ject's high level of mental activity. 
Day 14: The ritual brought our minds together. I was as-
sailed simultaneously by hunger and rage, as if some great 
force from beyond had reached out and commanded me 
only to kill and eat. Though it lasted only a short time, it 
was a terrifying feeling to my human mind, but in a way it 
was also comforting to feel myself a part of a much greater 
design. What I felt was not the hunger of one beast, but 
the hunger of all of them. 
Day 15: Used the ritual to join our minds again. This 
time I realized where the hunger began. I was consumed 
by the infinite hunger and boundless rage of great Yeeno-
ghu, and I knew it could never be sated. Yet I felt driven to 
feed my lord. I killed and devoured a goat while linked to 
the gnoll's mind. I had set aside a knife for the deed but 
killed it with my bare hands instead. The flesh was warm. I 
fed myself. I fed Yeenoghu. 
Day 16: Third use of ritual. As my connection to my lord 
deepens, I leave my old concerns behind. His hunger is all 
that matters. It is greater than me; it is greater than us all. 
It is His mark. He made us. He drives us. He eats what 
we eat. He kills what we kill. He will come if we eat well. 
He will come if we kill well. He will come if we eat well. He 
will come if we kill well. We will kill and He will eat, and we 
shall be He and He shall be we, never alone, never afraid, 
never hungry.
