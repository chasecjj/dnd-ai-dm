DEVOURER 
Of all the abominations Orcus has unleashed, devourers 
are among the most feared. These tall, mummy-like 
fiends wander the planes, consuming souls and, by ex-
ample, spreading Orcus's creed of replacing all life with 
everlasting death. 
Instruments ofOrcus. A lesser demon that proves 
itself to Orcus might be granted the privilege of becom-
ing a devourer. The Prince of Undeath transforms such 
a demon into an 8-foot-tall, desiccated humanoid with a 
hollowed-out ribcage, then fills the new creature with a 
hunger for souls. Orcus grants each new devourer the 
essence of a less fortunate demon to power the devour-
er's first foray into the planes. Most devourers remain 
in the Abyss, or on the Astral or Ethereal Plane, pur-
suing Orcus's schemes and interests in those realms. 
When Orcus sends devourers to the Material Plane, he 
often sets them on a mission to create, control, and lead 
a plague of undead. Skeletons, zombies, ghouls and 
ghasts, and shadows are parti_cularly attracted to the 
presence of a devourer. 
Tormentors of Souls. Devourers hunt humanoids, 
with the intent of consuming them body and soul. After 
a devourer brings a target to the brink of death, it pulls 
the victim's body in and traps the creature within its 
own ribcage. As the victim tries to stave off death (usu-
ally without success), the devourer tortures its soul with 
telepathic noise. When the victim expires, it undergoes 
a horrible transformation, springing forth from the de-
vourer's body to begin its new existence as an undead 
servitor of the monster that spawned it. 
Fiendish Nature. A devourer doesn't require air, food 
(other than souls), drink, or sleep.

Multiattack. The devourer makes two claw attacks and can use 
either Imprison Soul or Soul Rend. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach S ft., one 
target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + SJ slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) ne-
crotic damage. 
Imprison Soul. The devourer chooses a living humanoid with 
0 hit points that it can see within 30 feet of it. That creature is 
teleported inside the devourer's ribcage and imprisoned there. 
A creature imprisoned in this manner has disadvantage on 
death saving throws. If it dies while imprisoned, the devourer 
regains 25 hit points, immediately recharges Soul Rend, and 
gains an additional action on its next turn. Additionally, at the 
start of its next turn, the devourer regurgitates the slain crea-
ture as a bonus action, and the creature becomes an undead. 
If the victim had 2 or fewer Hit Dice, it becomes a zombie. If it 
had 3 to S Hit Dice, it becomes a ghoul. Otherwise, it becomes 
a wight. A devourer can imprison only one creature at a time. 
Soul Rend (Recharge 6). The devourer creates a vortex of 
life-draining energy in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Each 
humanoid in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving 
throw, taking 44 (8dl0) necrotic damage on a failed save, or 
half as much damage on a successful one. Increase the damage 
by 10 for each living humanoid with O hit points in that area.
