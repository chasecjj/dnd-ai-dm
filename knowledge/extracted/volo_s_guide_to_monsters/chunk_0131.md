GUARD DRAKE 
A guard drake is a reptilian creature created out of 
dragon scales by means of a bizarre and grisly ritual. 
When trained properly, a drake is obedient, loyal, and 
territorial, which makes it an excellent watchbeast that 
can follow simple commands. 
Gifts from Drasons. The ritual to create a guard 
drake was originally devised by the cult ofTiamat, but 
has spread to other groups that are skilled in arcana and 
associated with dragons. The cooperation of a dragon 
is necessary for the ritual to succeed, and a dragon typ-
ically provides its help when it wants to reward its allies 
or worshipers with a valuable servant. 
The ritual, which takes several days, requires 10 
pounds of fresh dragon scales {donated by the dragon 
allied with the group), a large amount of fresh meat, 
and an iron cauldron. When the process is complete, 
a halfling-sized egg emerges from the cauldron and is 
ready to hatch within a few hours. 
Baser to Learn, A newly hatched guard drake im-
prints upon the first creature that feeds it (usually the 
one planning to train it), establishing an aggressive but 
trusting bond with that individual. A guard drake is fully 
grown within two to three weeks and can be trained in 
the same length of time. One is the equivalent of a guard 
dog in terms of what it can be trained to do. 
A guard drake resembles the type of dragon it was cre-
ated from, but with a wingless, squat, muscular build. 
A drake can't reproduce, nor can its scales be used to 
make other guard drakes.
