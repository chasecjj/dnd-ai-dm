HOBGOBLINS 
Hobgoblins of the cruelest bent gain admittance to elite 
organizations that provide special training above and 
beyond what military service has to offer. The Academy 
of Devastation and the Iron Shadows are two such or-
ganizations, and their graduates are feared among the 
ranks of goblinkind. 
HOBGOBLIN DEVASTATOR 
In hobgoblin society, the Academy of Devastation iden-
tifies hobgoblins with a talent for magic and puts them 
through a grueling training regimen that endows them 
with the ability to call down fireballs and other destruc-
tive magic on the host's behalf. A hobgoblin devastator 
on the battlefield is simultaneously a boon to all its allies 
and a threat to every foe around it. 
Into the Fray. While other cultures treat their wizards 
as cloistered academics, hobgoblins expect their spell-
casters to fight. Devastators learn the basics of weapon 
use, and they measure their deeds by the enemies de-
feated though their magic. 
Devastators have the respect of other members of the 
host, and they receive obedience and deference from 
many quarters. Their ability to lay waste to entire forma-
tions with a single use of magic allows them to gain far 
more glory in battle than a single warrior. 
Other cultures might view the use of such abilities as 
a short cut to glory, but to hobgoblins a gift for magic is 
as valued and useful as a strong sword arm or brilliance 
in tactics. They are all boons from Maglubiyet that must 
be cultivated and unleashed upon the enemy. 
Only Results Matter. Devastators study a simplified 
form of evocation magic. Their training lacks the theory 
and context that other folk study, making them skilled in 
battle but relatively illiterate on the finer points of how 
and why their magic works. 
The Academy of Devastation believes that an aca-
demic approach to magic is a sign of weakness and 
inefficiency. A warrior doesn't need to know about met-
allurgy to wield a blade, so why should a wizard care 
about where magic comes from? Devastators love to 
prove their superiority in battle by seeking out enemy 
spellcasters and destroying them.
