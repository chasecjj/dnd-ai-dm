TREASURE 
Much of a hag's treasure is strewn among all the clutter 
in her lair, making it difficult for intruders to quickly 
identify all the items that have use or value. But the hag 
knows what, and where, everything is. 
Every hag is infallible when it comes to keeping track 
of her treasures and other possessions. Her organiza-
tion and labeling, if such a system exists, is designed to 
foil thieves and serve as a final, vexing puzzle for anyone 
who tries to make use of an item without her consent. 
A hag's treasure- like a gift from a fey being- should 
be doubted and even feared rather than simply being 
scooped up and carted away. Treasure-seekers are 
likely to fare better if they consider a hag's booty to 
be trapped, exercising caution rather than giving in to 
greed or curiosity. Manipulating a container or other 
item without knowing what's inside or what it does (or

without knowing the proper password or technique) is 
likely to be very dangerous. At best, whatever was held 
in a container merely escapes or dissipates. At worst, 
just about anything can happen, none of it good. 
ONE-OF-A-KIND OBJECTS 
Above and beyond the items of obvious value a hag has 
accumulated, she also has a few bizarre and unique 
items in her collection. The Hag Objects table provides a 
way to quickly add such weird items to a hag's home. 
HAG OBJECTS 
dlO 
Object 
The eye of a cleric, preserved in a liquid-filled jar. 
When an undead creature comes within 100 feet of the 
jar, the eye darts about as if it is looking around in a 
panic. It otherwise remains motionless. 
2 
The leathery, preserved head of a dwarf. Anyone who 
holds its 5-foot-long beard can see through its ~res. 
3 
A perfectly smooth, round stone the size of a human's 
fist. If placed on the ground, it rolls 20 feet per round 
toward the nearest source of fresh water. 
4 
A sickly crow with clipped wings. The only sound it can 
make is to roar like a lion. 
5 
A seemingly empty, sealed jar. If opened, the person 
standing closest to the jar suddenly recalls ld6 happy 
memories from the life of a long dead elf lord. 
6 
A seemingly mundane gold piece. Anyone who 
touches it gains the unshakable belief that this is the 
very first gold coin minted by humanity. 
7 
A black bo;,·3 feet on each side. Anyo,.;e who opens 
it finds a set of three wooden, articulated figures that 
are modeled after three members of the adventuring 
party. If the figures are stood on the ground, they act 
out insulting parodies of their duplicates' recent ac-
tions. 
8 
An oval-shaped disc made of an unknown metal. If it 
is tossed in the air, it flies in circles around the tosser 
for a minute, tiny lights winking on its surface, before 
settling to the ground nearby. 
9 
A thick, dusty tome, every page filled with tiny, barely 
legible writing. Careful study of the book reveals it to 
be a written transcript of every conversation that took 
place over the course of a year, three years ago, in a 
nearby village. 
10 
A small painting that depicts a placid field. Just after 
midnight each day, the painting changes to depict the 
following day's weather.
