ELDER BRAIN 
The ultimate expression of illithid domination, an elder 
brain sprawls within a vat of viscous brine, touching the 
thoughts of creatures near and far. It scrawls upon the 
canvas of their minds, rewriting their thoughts and au-
thoring their dreams. 
Psychic Infiltrators. When an elder brain infiltrates 
a mind, it alters the creature's perception and deceives 
its senses, causing it to see, hear, touch, taste, or feel 
reality according to the elder brain's intent. From across 
great distances, it implants subconscious suggestions or 
subtly influences dreams to compel creatures toward a 
course of action that benefits its grand plan. 
When its insidious suggestions fail to take hold, an el-
der brain asserts its dominance more directly. It seizes 
control of a resistant mind and controls the creature's 
body as it would a puppet. Against the rare, strong-
willed stalwart that defies it or attacks it, an elder brain 
sends a blast of overwhelming psychic force to crush the 
upstart's mind, rendering the creature a thoughtless, 
drooling shell. 
Devourer of Thoughts. An elder brain sustains it-
self by consuming the brains of other creatures. When 
the mind flayer servants that guard and tend to an 
elder brain don't bring its meals directly to it, the elder 
brain reaches out with tendrils of thought, nientally 
compelling creatures to come to it so that it may feed 
upon them. 
When a mind flayer perishes, the elder brain's ser-
vants feed the contents of its skull to their master, which 
absorbs the illithid's brain and all the knowledge and 
experience contained therein. In this way the elder 
brain continually increases its knowledge, uniting the 
thoughts and experiences of the illithid colony into a 
unified whole. Mind flayers conceive of this "oneness" 
as a sacred state in the same way that a worshiper of a 
human deity might view an eternal afterlife in the heav-
ens-for an elder brain can evoke the persona of any 
illithid it has ever absorbed. 
Hive Mind. Non-illithids call this creature an elder 
brain because it acts as the central communication hub 
for an entire mind flayer colony just as a brain does for 
a living body. Linked to the elder brain, the colony acts 
like a single organism, acting in concert as if each il-
lithid were the digit of a hand. 
Ego Unhindered. Each elder brain considers itself 
and its desires the most important things in the multi-
verse, the mind flayers in its colony nothing more than 
extensions of its will. But no two elder brains are alike, 
and each presides over its colony according to its own 
unique personality and storehouse of collected knowl-
edge and experience. Some elder brains reign as dom-
ineering tyrants, while others serve more benignly as 
sages, counselors, and repositories of information and 
lore for the mind flayers that protect and nourish them. 
The ambitions of an elder brain are always tempered 
by its relative immobility. Although its telepathic senses 
can reach for miles, moving anywhere is always a dan-
gerous proposition. If forced outside its brine pool, an 
elder brain will swiftly expire, and transporting an elder 
brain in its pool through confining and tortuous subter-
ranean tunnels frequently proves difficult or impossible. 
AN ELDER BRAIN'S LAIR 
The lair of an elder brain always lies deep in the heart 
of a mind flayer colony. The creature dwells in a dimly 
glowing brine pool, filled with foul and brackish wa-
ter infused with the elder brain's vital fluids and with 
psionic energy. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
When fighting inside its lair, an elder brain can use lair 
actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), an 
elder brain can take one lair action to cause one of the 
following effects; the elder brain can't use the same lair 
action two rounds in a row: 
• The elder brain casts wall of force. 
• The elder brain targets one friendly creature it can 
sense within 120 feet of it. The target has a flash of 
inspiration and gains advantage on one attack roll, 
ability check, or saving throw it makes before the end 
of its next turn. If the target doesn't or can't use this 
benefit in that time, the inspiration is lost. 
• The elder brain targets one creature it can sense 
within 120 feet of it and anchors it by sheer force of 
will. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma 
saving throw or be unable to leave its current space. 
It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
