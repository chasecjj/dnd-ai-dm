CRANIUM RATS 
Mind flayers create cranium rats by bombarding normal 
rats with psionic energy. 
Evil Collectives. Cranium rats are no smarter than 
ordinary rats and behave as such. However, if enough 
cranium rats come together to form a swarm, they 
merge their minds into a single intelligence with the 
accumulated memories of all the swarm's constituents. 
The rats become smarter as a result, and they retain 
their heightened intelligence for as long as the swarm 
persists. The swarm also awakens latent psionic abili-
ties implanted within each cranium rat by its mind flayer 
creators, bestowing upon the swarm psionic powers 
similar to spells.

Illumination. As a bonus action, the cranium rat can shed dim 
light from its brain in a 5-foot radius or extinguish the light. 
Telepathic Shroud. The cranium rat is immune to any effect 
that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as 
to all divination spells. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: l piercing damage. 
A rat separated from the swarm becomes an ordinary 
cranium rat with an Intelligence of 15. It loses 1 point of 
Intelligence each day that it remains separated from the 
swarm. Its Intelligence can't drop below 4 and becomes 
15 again if it rejoins the swarm or another one. 
Telepathic Vermin. A single, low-intelligence cranium 
rat uses its natural telepathy to communicate hunger, 
fear, and other base emotions. A swarm of cranium rats 
communicating telepathically "speaks" as one creature, 
often referring to itself using the collective pronouns 
"we" and "us." 
Spies for an Elder Brain. Mind flayer colonies use 
cranium rats as spies. The rats invade surface commu-
nities and act as eyes and ears for the elder brain, trans-
mitting their thoughts when they swarm and are within 
range of the elder brain's telepathy. 
Cranium rats occasionally spread beyond the elder 
brain's range of influence. Whatever these rats do is of 
no concern to the elder brain, and the illithids can al-
ways make more if they so desire.

Illumination. As a bonus action, the swarm can shed dim light 
from its brains in a 5-foot radius, increase the illumination to 
bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius (and dim light for an addi-
tional number offeet equal to the chosen radius), or extinguish 
the light. 
Innate Spellcasting (Psionics). The swarm's innate spellcasting 
ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13). As long as it has more 
than half of its hit points remaining, the swarm can innately 
cast the following spells, requiring no components: 
At will: command, comprehend languages, detect thoughts 
1/day each: confusion, dominate monster 
Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and 
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large 
enough for a Tiny rat. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain 
temporary hit points. 
Telepathic Shroud. The swarm is immune to any effect that 
would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as to all 
divination spells. 
ACTIONS 
Bites. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach Oft., one target in 
the swarm's space. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or 7 (2d6) 
piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
