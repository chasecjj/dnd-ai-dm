OTHER LIVES ARE CHEAP -
Yuan-ti put little value on humanoid lives, even those 
of their own slaves and cultists. They would poison 
children to carry out a threat against their parents, or 
turn one person into a broodguard in order to show 
her family the consequence of resistance. They might 
refrain from provoking others' feelings if doing so could 
adversely affect the yuan-ti's plans, but they understand 
humanoid psychology well enough to know that they 
can get away with this casual disregard for life al-
most anytime. 
Furthermore, in the yuan-ti caste system, a greater 
yuan-ti's life is worth far more than a lesser one's. 
Weaker citizens are expected to lay down their lives to 
protect their betters. Leaders rely on this zealotry in 
their plans, and although they don't needlessly waste 
the lives of purebloods on futile actions, most strategies 
include a fallback option in which mobs of purebloods 
and slaves are thrown at opposing forces in the hope of 
allowing the malisons and abominations time to escape. 
SURVIVAL FIR.ST 
Yuan-ti are likely to retreat or flee from conflict if they 
don't believe they have a reasonable chance of success. 
This reaction isn't out of cowardice, but practicality-yu-
an-ti value their own lives much too highly to risk them 
when the odds aren't in their favor. A short retreat might 
be just the thing to reach a better tactical position, find 
allies, or to allow the yuan-ti the opportunity to study 
their opponents and implement better tactics. Any en-
emy who chases a group of fleeing yuan-ti might be on 
the victorious side of a rout or could be heading into 
a trap; if the enemy has been encountered before, it is 
YUAN·Tl MAUSON VARIANTS: TYPES 4 AND 5 
A malison is a yuan-ti that has a blend of human and 
serpentine features. Three different types of malisons are 
described in the Monster Manual, and two rarer types are 
described here. Type 4 and type 5 matisons are the low-
est-ranking members of the malison caste, and neither 
type is venomous in its yuan-ti form. 
For a type 4 or type 5 malison, use the yuan-ti malison 
stat block in the Monster Manual, but replace the Mali-
son Type trait and the monster's action options with the 
following: 
Malison Type. The yuan-ti has one of the following types: 
Type 4: Human form with one or more serpentine tails 
Type 5: Human form covered in scales

likely that the yuan-ti have prepared a special ambush at 
the end of the pursuit. 
CAPTURE, NOT KILL 
The objective of the yuan-ti as a race is to conquer and 
enslave others; they don't espouse the sort of evil that 
calls for them to butcher or eradicate all who oppose 
them. In keeping with their goal of domination, the 
yuan-ti would rather capture potentially useful op-
ponents than kill them. They use many methods for 
capturing enemies, such as poisoning, knocking out an 
opponent instead of making a killing blow, throwing 
nets, using magic such as suggestion, or restraining 
them in the coils of a giant snake. 
To force their compliance, enemies might be brain-
washed, charmed, tortured, or transformed into brood-
guards. Those that prove intractable still have their 
uses, either as sacrifices to the gods or as food. 
DEPEND ON DECEIT 
Yuan-ti have no sense of honorable combat. They are 
naturally stealthy, and if they can sneak up on enemies, 
either in an ambush or to murder them in their sleep, 
the yuan-ti will do so-and they actually prefer these 
tactics to open warfare. Because abominations and 
malisons can change into the shapes of snakes, they can 
keep their presence hidden and get into places their nor-
mal forms couldn't enter. 
Their immunity to poison gives all yuan-ti a tactical 
advantage in dealing with other creatures. A pureblood 
serving as a food taster for a royal family could poison a 
meal and declare it "safe" after taking a bite. 
SERPENT CULTS 
Some humans believe that not only are the yuan-ti 
superior to humans and worthy of emulation, but they 
are also the blessed emissaries of the serpent gods. 
From these entwined beliefs are born the serpent cults, 
groups of devout mortals who serve the yuan-ti either 
directly or in foreign outposts. Fanatical in their ideals, 
these cultists are willing to die for the yuan-ti and their 
gods, whether from an enemy's weapon or at the point of 
a sacrificial knife. 
The yuan-ti use the cults devoted to them as a steady 
supply of willing minions and sycophants. Many yuan-ti 
establish or encourage cults to gather the special herbs 
and magic they need to perform the ritual for evolving 
into a more powerful form. And just as the yuan-ti have 
rituals to transform their own bodies, they have a ritual 
that can change a human into a pureblood. They some-
times use the promise of this ritual as an enticement 
for power-hungry followers or a reward for their most 
devoted cultists. 
In civilized society, cultists ingratiate themselves into 
the local populace, usually by promising perfection of 
the flesh (sometimes including the healing of afflictions), 
freedom from the ideas of sin and guilt, and hedonistic 
delights to those who join the cult. The leader of a cult 
is usually advised by a pureblood that relays orders and 
information between the cult and a yuan-ti city.
