Amphibious. The froghemoth can breathe air and water. 
Sho,k Sus,eptibility. If the froghemoth takes lightning damage, 
it suffers several effects until the end of its next turn: its speed 
is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving 
throws, it can't use reactions or Multiattack, and on its turn, it 
can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. 
ACTIONS 
Multiatta,k. The froghemoth makes two attacks with its tenta-
cles. It can also use its tongue or bite. 
Tentade. Melee Weapon Atta,k: +10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one 
target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is 
grappled (esqpe DC 16) ifit is a Huge or smaller creature. Un-
til the grapple ends, the froghemoth can't use this tentacle on 
another target. The froghemoth has four tentacles. 
Bite. Me lee Weapon Atta,k: + 10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 22 (3dl0 + 6) piercing damage, and the target is swallowed 
ifit is a Medium or smaller creature. A swallowed creature is 
blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and 
other effects outside the froghemoth, and takes 10 (3d6) acid 
damage at the start of each of the froghemoth's turns. 
The froghemoth's gullet can hold up to two creatures at a 
time. If the froghemoth takes 20 damage or more on a single 
turn from a creature inside it, the froghemoth must succeed on 
a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or re-
gurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls prone in a 
space within 10 feet of the froghemoth. If the froghemoth dies, 
a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can es-
cape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone. 
Tongue. The froghemoth targets one Medium or smaller 
creature that it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must 
make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the 
target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of 
the froghemoth, and the froghemoth can make a bite attack 
against it as a bonus action.

FROGHEMOTH 
A froghemoth is an amphibious predator as big as an 
elephant. It lairs in swamps and has four tentacles, a 
thick rubbery hide, a fang-filled maw with a prehensile 
tongue, and an extendable stalk sporting three bulbous 
eyes that face in different directions. 
Otherworldly Entities. Froghemoths are creatures 
not of this world. A journal purportedly written long ago 
by the wizard Lum the Mad describes strange, cylindri-
cal chambers of metal buried in the ground from which 
froghemoths emerged, but no reliable reports of the lo-
cation of such places exist. 
Hunsry from Birth. Every few years, a froghemoth 
can lay a fertile egg without mating. The froghemoth 
cares nothing for its egg, and might eat it the hatchling. 
A young froghemoth's survival is most often predicated 
on its parent leaving it behind in indifference. A new-
born froghemoth grows to full size over a period of 
months by indiscriminately preying on other creatures 
in its swampy domain. It learns to hide its enormous 
body in murky pools, keeping only its eyestalk above 
water to watch for passing creatures. When food comes 
within reach, the froghemoth erupts from its pool, ten-
tacles and tongue flailing. It can grab several targets 
at once, keeping them at bay while it wraps its tongue 
around another one and pulls it in to be devoured. 
Revered by Bullywuss. If a bullywug tribe 
comes across a froghemoth, the bullywugs treat the 
froghemoth as a god and do all they can to coax the 
monster into their den. A froghemoth can be tamed 
(after a fashion) by offering it food, and bullywugs can 
communicate with it on a basic level, so the creature 
might eat only a few bullywugs before following the rest. 
Bullywugs gather food as tribute for it, provide it with a 
comfortable lair, fanatically protect it from harm, and try 
to ensure that any young froghemoth reaches maturity.
