HAG NAMES 
Hags have whimsical names, often with a dark twist. 
A hag gives her newborn daughter a name that the girl 
keeps during her childhood, but upon gaining her full 
hag powers the daughter chooses her own name, which 
might or might not relate to her birth name. Some hags 
use different names in different guises, but still prefer 
their original name as their favorite. 
The Hag Names table allows you to generate a hag's 
name. You can also select from the table or use it as 
inspiration. 
Hags always have a title followed by a first name, or 
a first name followed by a last name. You can randomly 
determine (equal chance of either) whether a hag has a 
title or a last name.

WEIRD MAGIC 
Over the course of a seemingly endless lifetime, a hag 
typically discovers or creates several unusual ways to 
use magic. The weird magic that hags can call upon 
comes in a number of forms and with various means of 
activation. Even those who have read scholarly books 
about hag lore can't predict what a particular hag might 
have up her sleeve. 
A grandmother or some other hag of great age and 
renown might know unique rituals that can temporarily 
or permanently alter or transform a creature, bring back 
the dead for a limited time, rewrite memories, or siphon
