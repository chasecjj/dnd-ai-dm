SPECIAL ENEMIES 
When ores attack a settlement of humans or halflings, 
they will kill anyone who presents a threat, but they are 
more interested in grabbing plunder and food rather 
than in wanton slaughter. The elderly, children, and any 
who seem weak or meek enough might escape death. 
Ifthey leave the population more or less intact, the ores 
leave themselves the option of returning to raid the com-
munity over and over. 
When ores fight elves, all of that changes. The enmity 
between the two races cuts to the core, and no ore will 
leave an elf alive. Ores become so frenzied in combat 
against elves that they forget all about taking loot and 
valuables back to the tribe- the only trophies of any 
worth are the heads of their enemies. 
Ores treat dwarves somewhat differently from other 
foes, because they covet the homes that dwarves fashion 
for themselves. If a tribe succeeds in fighting its way into 
a dwarfhold, the ores will butcher any dwarl that stands 
against them, but it's really all about the property-they 
would be just as happy if all the dwarves ran away. 
STRENGTH RESPECTS STRENGTH 
Ores appreciate physical prowess and formidable com-
bat ability in any form. As such, they might accept other 
creatures into their ranks from time to time. Ores have 
been known to associate with wereboars and ettins, 
both creatures that can markedly improve a tribe's mur-
derous efficiency. For a promise of sufficient food and 
loot, a troll might accompany a tribe temporarily. 
A group of ores can be dominated by evil creatures of 
immense power, and they accept this subservient role 
either because they are forced to or because it offers 
them a measure of security while they engage in their 
savagery. Green dragons, for instance, sometimes use 
ores as sentinels or shock troops. Ores are sometimes 
attracted to the service of frost giants or fire giants, who 
then "reward" their loyalty by turning them into slaves. 
If a tribe is defeated and driven from its lair, the survi-
vors might come under the sway of a strong but dimwit-
ted creature, such as a hill giant or an ogre. It is also not 
unheard of for an exceptionally strong and charismatic 
evil human to lead stray ores that no longer have a tribe 
to call their own. 
WHEN TRIBES TEAM UP 
An ore tribe typically has no more than a few hundred 
members, because a larger group would need a prohib-
itive amount of resources to remain strong. As a rule, a 
tribe is violently hostile toward any other tribe it meets, 
seeing the rival ores first and foremost as competitors 
for food and victims. 
On some occasions, though, tribes that have a 
common concern band together. The result is an ore 
horde- a sea of slavering killers that washes over the 
countryside and leaves vast tracts of devastation in its 
wake. Such' an event is rare in the extreme, but its con-
sequences can lay low entire nations that are unable to 
stand against the wave. 
ORC CULTURE AND BELIEFS 
Ores live in constant fear of their gods, and their behav-
ior is rooted in that mentality. They believe that they can 
see the influence of the gods everywhere in the world 
around them, and the priests of a tribe are entrusted 
with the responsibility of identifying these signs and 
omens- both good and bad- and deciding how the tribe 
should react to them. 
As a race, ores have no noteworthy universal social 
traits, but some commonality does exist in the crude 
written communication that all ores employ and in the 
way that they use pigments to decorate and distinguish 
themselves and their lairs. 
OMENS AND SUPERSTITIONS 
Ores believe that any seemingly unimportant discovery 
or event- a bear's claw marks on a tree, a flock of crows, 
or a sudden gust of wind- might be a communication 
from the gods. If the tribe has encountered a similar 
omen before, the priests understand how to interpret it, 
but if a sign from the gods has no clear explanation, the
