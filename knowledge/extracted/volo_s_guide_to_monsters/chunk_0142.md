MEENLOCK 
Meenlocks are deformed fey that invoke terror and seek 
to destroy all that is good, innocent, and beautiful. They 
primarily live in forests, although they adapt well to ur-
ban and subterranean settings. 
Fear Incarnate. Meenlocks are spawned by fear. 
Whenever fear overwhelms a creature in the Feywild, 
or in any other location where the Feywild's influence 
is strong, one or more meenlocks might spontaneously 
arise in the shadows or darkness nearby. If more than 
one meenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. The 
earth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnels 
open up within it. One of these newly formed passage-
ways serves as the lair's only entrance and exit. 
Meenlocks give other creatures the creeps and project 
a supernatural aura that instills terror in those nearby. 
So evil and twisted are they that a palpable sense of 
foreboding haunts those who intrude upon a meenlock 
lair. Inside the warren, black moss covers every surface, 
muffling sound. A large central chamber serves as the 
meenlocks' den, where they torment captives. 
Dark Dwellers. A meenlock shuns bright light. It can 
supernaturally sense areas of darkness and shadow in 
its vicinity and thus is able to teleport from one dark-
ened space to another-enabling it to sneak up on its 
prey or run away when outmatched. 
Telepathic Tormentors. Meenlocks have no form of 
communication other than telepathy. They can use it to 
project unsettling hallucinations into the minds of their 
prey. These hallucinations take the form of terrible whis-
pers or fleeting movements just at the edges of one's 
peripheral vision. 
During the day, meenlocks confine themselves to their 
dark warrens. At night, they crawl out of their tunnels to 
torment sleeping prey, particularly those who seem to 
embody all that is good in the world. Meenlocks like to 
paralyze creatures with their claws, drag them back to 
their hidden den, beat them unconscious, and telepath-
ically torture them over a period of hours. A humanoid 
that succumbs to this psychic torment undergoes a 
transformation into an evil, full-grown meenlock (see 
the "Telepathic Torment" sidebar). 
TELEPATHIC TORMENT 
Up to four meenlocks can telepathically torment one inca-
pacitated creature, filling its mind with disturbing sounds 
and dreadful imagery. Participating meenlocks can't use 
their telepathy for any other purpose during this time, 
though they can move about and take actions and reac-
tions as normal. This torment has no effect on a creature 
that is immune to the frightened condition. If the creature 
is susceptible and remains incapacitated for 1 hour, the 
creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 
(3d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. The save DC is 10 + the num-
ber of meenlocks participating in the torment, considering 
only those that remain within sight of the victim for the 
entire hour and aren't incapacitated during it. The process 
can be repeated. A humanoid that drops to O hit points as 
a result of this damage instantly transforms into a meen-
lock at full health and under the OM 's control. Only a wish 
spell or divine intervention can restore a transformed crea-
ture to its former state.
