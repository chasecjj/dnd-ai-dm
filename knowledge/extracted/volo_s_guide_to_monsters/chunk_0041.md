name and colors along with them, and assuming places

Uphold the Lesion. Hobgoblins care more for the sur-
vival of their legion than they do for others of their own 
kind. Two legions might battle over territory, resources, 
or power, or out of simple pride. Such a feud can con-
tinue over generations in an ongoing cycle of retribution. 
Each legion has a list of grievances against any others it 
knows about, and any legions meeting for the first time 
view each other with immediate hostility. Only a truly 
great warlord can force legions to work together as an 
army if Maglubiyet has not called forth a host. 
IRON SHADOWS 
A few hobgoblins have mastered a system of unarmed 
combat called the Path of the Iron Shadow. Its practi-
tioners are known as Iron Shadows. They serve as a se-
cret police force and a spy network in hobgoblin society. 
Statistics for a typical hobgoblin Iron Shadow can be 
found in chapter 3. 
The Iron Shadows recruit from all ranks of hobgoblin 
society. They answer only to the priests of Maglubiyet, 
and use their talents for stealth, disguise, and unarmed 
combat to squash potential insurrections and treachery 
before an uprising can flourish. 
These hobgoblins have the ability to command 
shadow magic to conceal their true nature, create dis-
tracting illusions, and walk from OD!') shadow to the next. 
When they operate in the open, they wear masks that 
resemble the leering faces of devils. As befits their role 
in society, they receive proper deference from all other 
hobgoblins that cross their path. 
ACADEMY OF DEVASTATION 
Hobgoblins know the value of arcane magic in warfare. 
Where other cultures treat magic as an individual pur-
suit, a calling that only a select few can even attempt, 
hobgoblins practice mass indoctrination and testing to 
identify every potential caster in their ranks. 
The Academy of Devastation is a hobgoblin institution 
made up of spellcasters. Members are sent abroad to 
test young hobgoblins. Those who show an aptitude for 
magic are enrolled in the academy, brought to a hidden 
school, and subjected to a rigorous regimen of drills, 
exercises, and study. In the academy's view, every young 
student is a potential new devastator, destined to be 
forged into a weapon of war. 
Hobgoblin devastators have little knowledge of or use 
for spells that have no use on the battlefield. They are 
taught potent, destructive spells and also learn the fun-
damentals of evocation magic. The death and destruc-
tion they bring about is worthy of as many accolades 
as the ruin wrought by traditional warriors. Luckily for 
their enemies, devastators seldom employ sophisticated 
tactics, functioning essentially as a mobile artillery bat-
tery. They can bring tremendous force to bear, but rarely 
display the versatility and inventiveness of spellcasting 
elves and humans. A few do become accomplished tacti-
cians in their own right, and it isn't uncommon for such 
an individual to serve as the warlord of a legion. 
Statistics for a typical hobgoblin devastator can be 
found in chapter 3. 
HOBGOBLIN LAIRS 
When hobgoblins aren't on the move, they have a stable 
lifestyle and society wherein they can raise new gen-
erations, train them, and prepare for future battles. If 
few enemies exist nearby and the hobgoblins in a legion 
have room to spread out, the members of each banner 
might live in a separate location, effectively its own set-
tlement, with worg riders and messenger ravens passing 
communications between the sites. 
In lands dominated by other humanoids, hobgoblins 
will settle for taking up residence in an old dungeon or 
ruin where they can hide their numbers and keep their 
presence secret. Such an arrangement isn't desirable, 
because space is usually at a premium. 
Permanent Visitors. If a hobgoblin legion is looking 
for a place to set down roots, its first choice is an out-
of-the-way area that has adequate resources or can be 
improved to suit the hobgoblins' needs. Land for farm-
ing or grazing is desirable, as is access to lumber, stone, 
or metal ore. If the hobgoblins find a place that fits the 
bill, they build non-portable facilities such as forges and 
sawmills, marking their intention to stay either until all 
the resources have been harvested or until Maglubiyet 
calls them off to war. If the hobgoblins are interested in 
doing business with the outside world, they might erect 
a trading post on the fringe of their territory where other 
people can come to exchange goods and coin. 
Who Goes There? A hobgoblin lair resembles nothing 
so much as a military base. It is always well guarded, 
whether by lone sentries perched in trees or a stone 
tower with a full garrison of troops. As space permits, 
large areas are dedicated for use as training grounds, 
marshaling fields, target ranges, combat arenas, and 
similar facilities for the practice of warfare. Monuments, 
typically statues and pillars, are erected around these 
areas to remind the legion of past glories. 
Every legion's headquarters includes a command 
center where the warlord meets with banner leaders 
and others of high rank. Inside the complex or some-
where near it is the Way to Glory- a road, river, tunnel, 
or valley on either side of which the honored dead are 
interred, each burial site complete with a description of 
the banner, rank, and glories of its occupant. 
The quarters for troops are austere but sufficient, as 
are the necessary stables and dens to hold the legion's 
animals and beasts. Legions that have need of such 
amenities also set aside space for a library, which can
