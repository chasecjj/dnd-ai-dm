MAKING A 8R00DGUARD 
Yuan-ti create broodguards from captured humanoids. 
Each subject is fed a special potion that immediately ren-
ders it incapacitated and transforms it into a broodguard 
over the. next l d6 + 6 days. A subject forced to imbibe the 
brew can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; on a 
success, it takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and isn't other· 
wise affected. 
A spell such as lesser restoration or remove curse can end 
the transformation process at any time before it runs its 
course. After the process is complete, only a wish spell can 
reverse the effect. 
its disposal to launch small-scale wars against its neigh-
bors. Each conquest brings new slaves and sacrifices, 
as well as glory and riches, that the anathema thinks it 
needs to achieve true divinity. 
An anathema's most loyal yuan-ti followers see it as 
the pinnacle of the serpentine form, an unbelievable 
improvement on the nearly perfect abomination. Its 
devoted human followers think of it as "divine flesh in a 
mortal body," and cultists serving an anathema tend to 
be more bloodthirsty and self-sacrificing in its presence. 
Immortal. Anathemas don't age, allowing them to 
pursue their goals until the end of days. Truly powerful 
ones can grow to rule multiple yuan-ti cities and bring 
entire regions, including humanoid realms, under 
yuan-ti control. 
YUAN-TIBROODGUARD 
Broodguards are humanoids transformed by yuan-ti into 
simple-minded, scaly creatures that do their masters' 
bidding. The transformation process warps not only a 
subject's body but also its mind, making it instinctively 
obey any yuan-ti and filling it with a seething rage that 
rises at the sight of non-reptilian creatures. 
Although broodguards have low intelligence, they 
are able to perform simple yet important tasks in the 
community, such as guarding eggs or patrolling for in-
truders. The yuan-ti refer to broodguards as "histachii," 
which means "egg-watchers." 
Human No More. Most broodguards are made from 
human prisoners forced to consume a magical brew that 
renders them helpless and unable to fight off the inevi-
table. A human transformed into a broodguard loses all 
semblance of who it once was, and even its human ori-
gin is barely discernible. A broodguard is hairless and 
emaciated, with yellow-green, scaly skin. It has beady, 
bloodshot eyes and a forked tongue, and smells faintly of 
rotting meat. Broodguards can speak but rarely do so, 
preferring to use snake-like hisses and guttural noises. 
YUAN-TI MIND WHISPERER 
Mind whisperers are malison spellcasters that enter into 
a pact with the serpent god Sseth, the Sibilant Death. 
They use their abilities to convert others to their faith, 
increase their personal power, and befuddle the minds 
of their enemies. 
A mind whisperer is elusive, manipulative, unpredict-
able, and willing to cheat or kill comrades and rivals 
alike if doing so benefits it. The worshipers of Sseth 
have their hands in many schemes, often plying the
