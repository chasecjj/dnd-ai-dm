To the common folk of the world, an ore is an ore. They 
know that any one of these savages can tear an ordinary 
person to pieces, so no further distinction is necessary. 
Ores know better. Different groups of ores exist within 
a tribe, the actions of each dictated by the deity they pay 
homage to. To complement the various kinds of warriors 
that spill forth to ravage the countryside, each tribe has 
members that remain deep inside the lair, seldom if ever 
seeing what lies outside the darkness of their den. 
In addition, ores have special relationships with two 
creatures that are sometimes found in their company: 
the aurochs, a great bull that serves as a mount for 
warriors that revere Bahgtru, and the tanarukk, a 
demon-ore crossbreed that is so depraved and destruc-
tive that even ores seek to kill it. The aurochs is de-
scribed in appendix A. The tanarukk is described below. 
ORC BLADE OF ILNEVAL 
Ilneval is Gruumsh's battle captain, a devious strategist 
who directs Gruumsh's soldiers with boldness. Among 
ores, warriors that venerate Ilneval emulate their deity. 
Such ores learn to command their fellows in ways that 
are unpredictable but help to ensure victory.
