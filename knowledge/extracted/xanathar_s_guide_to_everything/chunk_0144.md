acter begins with a modest lifestyle, which improves as 
the character attains higher levels. 
These benefits are summarized on the Individual 
Treasure table. Ways for characters to s pend their 
treasure are covered in the "Buying and Selling" sec-
tion below.

MAGIC ITEMS 
Characters earn treasure points from adventures, then 
redeem those points in exchange for magic items. The 
list of available magic items is agreed to and compiled 
by the DMs running the campaign. 
GAINING TREASURE POINTS 
Each character earns treasure points based on an ad-
venture's tier and its intended playing time: 
• 1 treasure point is awarded for every 2 hours played in 
a tier 1 or tier 2 adventure. 
• 1 treasure point is awarded for every 1 hour played in 
a tier 3 or tier 4 adventure. 
As with the variant rules for gaining levels, this award is 
based on the adventure's projected playing time, rather 
than the actual time a group spent at the table. 
If a character completes an adventure of a tier higher 
than that character's tier, the character receives 1 addi-
tional treasure point for that adventure. 
CREATING AN ITEM LIST 
The DMs of the shared campaign should work together 
to compile a list of magic items that players can pur-
chase. The magic item tables in chapter 2 of this book 
and in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide are the 
obvious starting point. Choosing which items to allow 
or ban is a matter of personal preference, just as it is for 
the DM in a standard campaign. Involving all the DMs 
helps to ensure that the list meets everyone's expecta-
tions. When in doubt, disallow an item; it's easier to add 
it to the available items at a later time than it would be to 
remove it from the game once it has been handed out. 
Naturally, the list of available items is longer for ad-
ventures in the higher tiers, and the point cost of those 
higher-tier items likewise increases. The Magic [terns by 
Tier table provides the details. 
For instance, treasure points from a tier 1 adventure 
can be s pent on items from tables A, B, C, and F. Any 
item on the first three tables costs 4 points, and an item 
from table F costs 8 points.

SPEN DING TREASURE POINTS 
Players must spend treasure points at the end of a play 
session, immediately after determining whether their 
characters have gained a level. The order of these steps 
is important, since a character might enter a new tier 
because of the level gain. 
P layers are entitled to choose any approved item from 
one of the magic item tables available in the current tier. 
Treasure points can be s pread across multiple items. 
Many items cost more treasure points than a charac-
ter can earn in a 2- or 4-hour adventure. To buy such an 
item, a cha racter can make a deposit, spending treasure 
points on the item until it's paid off, at which time the 
character gains the item. 
BUYING AND SELLING 
Characters can use their monetary treasure to purchase 
anything from the equipment lists in chapter 5 of the 
Player's Handbook. In addition, the Adventurers League 
allows characters to purchase potions and spell scrolls, 
as detailed below. A spell scroll can be purchased 
only by a character who is capable of casting the s pell 
in question.

In a shared campaign, characters are not entitled to sell 
items they find on adventures or equipment they pur-
chase with their personal funds. Weapons, armor, a nd 
other gear used by enemies are considered too damaged 
to have any moneta ry value.
