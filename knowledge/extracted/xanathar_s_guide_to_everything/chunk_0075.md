MONSTER P ERSONALITY 
To address the question of a monster's personality, you 
can use the tables in chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's 
Guide, use the Monster Personality table below, or sim-
ply jot down a few notes based on a creature's Monster 
Manual description. During the battle, you can use these 
ideas to inform how you portray the monsters and their 
actions. To keep things s imple, you can assign the same 
personality traits to an entire group of monsters. For ex-
ample, one bandit gang might be an unruly mob of brag-
garts, while the members of another gang are always on 
edge and ready to flee at the first sign of danger.

MONSTER RELATIONSHIPS 
Do rivalries, hatreds, or attachments exist among the 
monsters in an encounter? I.f so, you can use s uch re-
lationships to inform the monsters' behavior during 
combat. The death of a much-revered leader might 
throw its followers into a frenzy. On the other hand, a 
monster might decide to flee if its spouse is killed, or a 
mistreated toady might be eager to surrender and betray 
its master in return for its life.

TERRAIN AND TRAPS 
A few elements that make a battlefield something other 
than a large area of flat ground can go a long way to-
ward spicing up an encounter. Consider setting your en-
counter in an area that would provide challenges even if 
a fight were not taking place there. What potential perils 
or other features might draw the characters' attention, 
either before or during the fight? Why are monsters lurk-
ing in this a rea to begin with-does it offer good hiding 
places, for instance? 
To add deta ils to an encounter area at random, look to 
the tables in appendix A of the Dungeon Master's Guide 
to determine room and area features, potential hazards, 
obstacles, traps, and more. 
RANDOM EVENTS 
Consider what might happen in an encounter area if the 
characters were to never enter it. Do the guards serve in 
shifts? What other characters or monsters might visit? 
Do creatures gather there to eat or gossip? Are there 
any natural phenomena-such as strong winds, earth 
tremors, or rain squalls-that sometimes take place 
in the area? Random events can add a fun element of 
the unexpected to an encounter.Just when you think 
a fight's outcome is evident, an unforeseen event can 
make things more compelling. 
A number of the tables in the Dungeon Master's Guide 
can suggest random events. The tables used for encoun-
ter location, weird locales, and wilderness weather in 
chapter 5 of that book are a good starting point for out-
door encounters. The tables in appendix A can be useful 
for indoor and outdoor encounters-especially the tables 
for obstacles, traps, and tricks. Finally, consult the ran-
dom encounter tables in the next section of this book for 
inspiration. 
QUICK MATCHUPS 
The guidelines above assume that you are concerned 
about balance in your combat encounters and have 
enough time to prepare them. If you don't have much 
time, or if you want s impler but less precise guidelines, 
the Quick Matchups table below offers an alternative. 
This table gives you a way to match a character of 
a certain level with a number of monsters. The table 
lists the challenge ratings to use for including one, two, 
and four monsters per character for each level. For in-
s tance, looking at the 3rd-level entry on the table, you 
can see that a CR 1/2 monster is equivalent to one 3rd-
level character, as are two CR 1/4 monsters and four 
CR 1/8 ones.
