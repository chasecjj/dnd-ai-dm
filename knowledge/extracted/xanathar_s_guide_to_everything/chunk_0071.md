someone might cast charm person on a creature be-
lieved to be a humanoid, not knowing that the target is 
in fact a vampire. If this issue comes up, handle it using 
the following rule. 
If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't 
be affected by the spell, nothing happens to that target, 
but if you used a spell s lot to cast the spell, the s lot is 
still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a 
target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target 
appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even 
though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the crea-
ture is in fact an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive 
that the spell did nothing to the target. 
AREAS OF EFFECT ON A GRID 
The Dungeon Master's Guide includes the following 
short rule for using areas of effect on a grid. 
Choose an intersection of squares as the point of 
origin of an area of effect, then follow the rules for that 
kind of area as normal (see the "Areas of Effect" section 
in chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). If an area of ef-
fect is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects 
that square. 
That rule works, but it can require a fair amount of 
on-the-spot adjudication. This section offers two alterna-
tives for determining the exact location of an area: the 
template method and the token method. Both of these 
methods assume you're using a grid and miniatures of 
some sort. Because these methods can yield different 
res ults for the number of squares in a given area, it's 
not recommended that they be combined at the table-
choose whichever method you and your players find eas-
ier or more intuitive. 
TEMPLATE METHOD 
The template method uses two-dimensional shapes 
that represent different areas of effect. The aim of the 
method is to accurately portray the length and width 
of each area on the grid and to leave little doubt about 
which creatures are affected by it. You'll need to make 
these templates or find premade ones. 
Making a Template. Making a template is s imple. Get 
a piece of paper or card stock, and cut it in the shape of 
the area of effect you're using. Every 5 feet of the area 
equals 1 inch of the template's size. For example, the 
20-foot-radius sphere of the fireball spell, which has a 
40-foot diameter, would translate into a circula r tem-
plate with an 8-inch diameter. 
Using a Template. To use an area-of-effect template, 
apply it to the grid. If the terrain is flat, you can lay it on 
the surface; otherwise, hold the template above the sur-
face and take note of which squares it covers or partially 
covers. If any part of a square is under the template, that 
square is included in the area of effect. If a creature's 
miniature is in a n affected square, that creature is in 
the area. Being adjacent to the edge of the template 
isn't enough for a square to be included in the area of 
effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by 
the template. 
You can also use this method without a grid. If you do 
so, a creature is included in an area of effect if any part 
of the miniature's base is overlapped by the template.
