Unicorn Spirit. The unicorn spirit lends its protection 
to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on 
all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's 
aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot 
that restores hjt points to any creature inside or outside 
the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also 
regains hit points equal to your druid level. 
MIGHTY SUMMONER 
Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are 
more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned 
or created by a spell that you cast gains the follow-
ing benefits: 
The creature appears with more hit points than nor-
mal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has. 
• The damage from its natural weapons is considered 
magical for the purpose of overcoming immuruty and 
resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage. 
GUARDIAN SPIRIT 
Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards 
the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. 
When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with 
a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that crea-
ture regains a number of hit points equal to half your 
druid level. 
FAITHFUL SUMMONS 
Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune 
with protect you when you are the most defenseless. 
If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated 
against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits 
of conjure animals as if it were cast using a 9th-level 
spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are 
challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear 
within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from 
you, they protect you from harm a nd attack your foes. 
The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or 
until you dismiss it (no action required). 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 
LEARNING BEAST SHAPES 
The Wild Shape feature in the Player's Handbook lets 
you transform into a beast that you've seen. That rule 
gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility, making it 
easy to amass an array of beast form options for your-
self, but you must abide by the limitations in the Beast 
Shapes table in that book. 
When you gain Wild Shape as a 2nd-level druid, you 
might wonder which beasts you've already seen. The 
following tables organize beasts from the Monster Man-
ual according to the beasts' most likely environments. 
Consider the environment your druid grew up in, then 
consult the appropriate table for a list of animals that 
your druid has probably seen by 2nd level. 
These tables can also help you and your DM deter-
mine which animals you might see on your travels. 
In addition, the tables include each beast's challenge 
rating and note whether a beast has a flying or swim-
ming speed. This information will help you determine 
whether you qualify to assume that beast's form.
