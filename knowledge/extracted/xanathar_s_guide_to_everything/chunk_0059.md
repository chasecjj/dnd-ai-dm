WHAT'S NEXT? 
When you're finished using these tables, you'll have a 
collection of facts and notes that- at a minimum- encap-
s ulate what your character has been doing in the world 
up till now. Sometimes that might be all the information 
you want, but you don't have to stop there. 
By using your creativity to stitch a ll these bits together 
into a continuous narrative, you can create a full-Aedged 
autobiography for your character in as little as a few 
sentences-an excellent example of how the whole is 
greater than the sum of its parts. 
Did you get a couple of results on the tables that don't 
outright contradict each other but also don't seem to fit 
together smoothly? If so, now is your chance to explain 
what happened to you. For instance, let's say you were 
born in a castle, but your childhood home was in the 
wilderness. It could be that your parents traveled from 
their forest home to seek help from a midwife at the 
castle when your mother was close to giving birth. Or 
your parents might have been members of the castle's 
staff before you were born, but they were released from 
service soon after you came into the world. 
In addition to deepening your own roleplaying experi-
ence, your character's history presents your DM with op-
portunities to weave those elements into the story of the 
campaign. Any way you look at it, adding definition to 
your character's pre-adventuring life is time well spent. 
RACIAL FEATS 
Leveling up in a class is the main way a character 
evolves during a campaign. Some DMs a lso allow the 
use of feats to customize a character. Feats are an op-
tional rule in chapter 6, "Customization Options," of the 
Player's Handbook. The DM decides whether they're 
used and may also decide that some feats are available 
in a campaign and others aren't. 
This section introduces a collection of special feats 
that a llow you to explore your character's race fur-
ther. These feats are each associated with a race from 
the Player's Handbook, as summarized in the Racial 
Feats table. A racial feat represents either a deepening 
connection to your race's culture or a physical trans-
formation that brings you closer to an aspect of your 
race's lineage. 
The cause of a particular transformation is up to you 
and your DM. A transformational feat can symbolize a 
latent quality that has emerged as you age, or a transfor-
mation might be the result of an event in the campaign, 
s uch as exposure to powerful magic or visiting a place of 
ancient significance to your race. Transformations are a 
fundamental motif of fantasy literature and folklore. Fig-
uring out why your character has changed can be a rich 
addition to your campaign's story.

BOUNTIFUL LUCK 
Prerequisite: Halffing 
Your people have extraordinary luck, which you have 
learned to mystically lend to your companions when you 
see them falter. You're not sure how you do it; you just 
wish it, and it happens. Surely a sign of fortune's favor!
