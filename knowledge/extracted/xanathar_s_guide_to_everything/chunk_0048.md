TACTICAL WIT 
Starting at 2nd level, your keen ability to assess tactical 
situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can 
give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your 
Intelligence modifier. 
POWER SURGE 
Starting at 6th level, you can store magical energy 
within yourself to later empower your damaging s pells. 
In its stored form, this energy is called a power surge. 
You can store a maximum number of power surges 
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). 
Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power 
surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end 
a spell with dispel magic or counterspell, you gain one 
power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you 
foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you 
gain one power surge. 
Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature 
or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power 
surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The ex-
tra damage equals half your wizard level. 
DURABLE MAGIC 
Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps 
ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a 
spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws. 
DEFLECTING SHROUD 
At 14th level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused 
with deadly magic. When you use your Arcane Deflec-
tion feature, you can cause magical energy to arc from 
you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can 
see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal 
to half your wizard level.

THrs Is YouR LIFE 
The character creation rules in the P layer's Handbook 
provide a ll the information you need to define your cha r-
acter in preparation for a life of adventuring. What they 
don't do is account for all the circumstances that shaped 
your character during the years between your birth and 
the s ta rt of your career as a member of a class. 
What did your cha racter accomplis h or experience be-
fore deciding to become an adventurer? What were the 
circums tances of your birth? How la rge is your family, 
and what sorts of relationships do you have with your 
relatives? Which people were the greatest influences on 
you during your formative years, for better or worse? 
To answer these questions and more, you can use 
the tables and the advice in this section to compose a 
well-developed backstory for your character-an auto-
biography of sorts- that you can use to inform how you 
roleplay the character. Your DM can draw from this ma-
terial as the campaign proceeds, creating situations and 
scenarios that build off your previous life experiences. 
IDEAS, NOT RULES 
--------------
Even though these pages are full of tables and die rolls, 
they don't make up a rules system- in fact, the opposite 
is true. You can use as much or as little of this material 
as you desire, and you can make decisions in any or-
der you want. 
For instance, you might oot want these tables to help 
you decide who your parents and siblings are, because 
that's among the information you've already come up 
with. But you can still use other parts, s uch as the sec-
tion on life events, to provide added depth a nd detail. 
How AND WHEN TO USE THE TABLES 
U you're comfortable with letting the dice decide a cer-
tain fact about your character, go a head and roll. If not, 
you can take charge and make the decision, choos ing 
from among the possibilities on a table. Of course, you 
also have the option of dis regarding the result of a die 
roll if it conflicts w ith a nother result. Likewise, if the 
text instructs you to roll on a table, that's not meant to 
be taken literally. You can a lways make your own choice. 
Although these tables are meant to augment the 
s tep-by-step character creation process in the Player's 
Handbook, they don't occupy a specific place in that pro-
cess. You can use some of them early on- for instance, 
it's possible to determine your parents and other family 
members immediately after deciding your character's 
race-but you could also wait until later in the process. 
You might prefer to establis h more facts about your 
character's game identity-such as your class, ability 
scores, and alignment- before s upplementing that infor-
mation w ith what's offered here. 
SECTION BY SECTION 
This material is divided into four sections, each address-
ing a different aspect of your cha racter's backstory. 
Origins. To find out who and where you came from, 
use the "Origins" section. When you're done, you will 
have a summary of facts about your parents, your sib-
lings, a nd the circumstances under which you grew up. 
A YOUNG STREET URCH I N P I LFERS A P O UCH ANO, TO HER 
SURPRISE, BECO M ES THE N EW OWN ER OF A SPELLBOOI< 
Personal Decisions. After you have selected your 
cha racter's background and class, use the appro-
priate tables to determine how you came to make 
those choices. 
Life Events. Your character's existence until now, no 
matter how brief or uneventful, has been marked by one 
or more life events-memorable happenings that have 
had an effect on who you are today. 
Supplemental Tables. Your life has intersected with 
the lives of plenty of other people, all the way from your 
infancy to today. When a result mentions such a person, 
you can use the supplemental tables (page 72) to add 
needed details- s uch as race, class, or occupation- to 
that person. Some tables in the other sections direct you 
to one or more of the s upplemental tables, and you can 
also use them any other time you see fit. 
ORIGINS -------
The usual first step in creating your character's life s tory 
is to determine your early circums tances. W ho were 
your parents? Where were you born? Did you have any 
siblings? Who raised you? You can address these ques-
tions by using the following tables. 
PARENTS 
You had pa rents, of course, even if they didn't raise you. 
To determine what you know about these people, use 
the Parents table. If you want, you can roll separately on 
the table for your mother and your father. Use the s up-
plemental tables as desired (particularly Class, Occupa-
tion, and Alignment) to learn more about your parents.
