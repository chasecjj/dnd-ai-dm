BARD 
MUSIC IS THE FRU IT OF THE DJVINE TREE THAT V IBRATES 
with the Words of Creation. But the question I ask you is, 
can a bard go to the root of this tree? Can one tap into the 
source of that power? Ah. then what manner of music they 
would bring to this world! 
- fletcher Danairia, master bard 
Bards bring levity dur ing grave times; they impart wis-
dom to offset ignorance; and they make the ridiculous 
seem sublime. Bards are preservers of ancient history, 
their songs and tales perpetuating the memory of great 
events down through time-knowledge so important 
that it is memor ized and passed along as oral history, to 
survive even w hen no written record remains. 
It is also the bard's role to chronicle smaller and more 
contemporary events- the stories of today's heroes, 
including their feats of valor as well as their less than 
impressive failures. 
Of course, the world has many people who can carry 
a tune or tell a good story, and there's much more to any 
adventuring bard than a glib tongue and a melodious 
voice. Yet what truly sets bards apart from others- and 
from one another-are the style and substance of their 
performances. 
To grab and hold the attention of an audience, bards 
are typically flamboyant and outgoing when they per-
form. The most famous of them are essentially the D& D 
world's equivalent of pop stars. If you're playing a bard, 
consider using one of your favor ite musicians as a role 
model for your character. 
You can add some unique aspects to your bard charac-
ter by considering the suggestions that follow. 
DEFINING WORK 
Every successful bard is renowned for at least one piece 
of performance art, typically a song or a poem that 
is popular with everyone who hears it. These perfor-
mances are spoken about for years by those w ho view 
them, and some spectators have had their lives forever 
changed because of the experience. 
If your character is just starting out, your ultimate de-
fining work is likely in the future. But in order to make 
any sort of living at your profession, chances are you 
already have a piece or two in your repertoire that have 
proven to be audience pleasers.

INSTRUMENT 
In a bard's quest for the ultimate performance and the 
highest acclaim, one's instrument is at least as import-
ant as one's vocal ability. The instrument's quality of 
manufacture is a critical factor, of course; the best ones 
make the best music, and some bards are continually 
on the lookout for an improvement. Perhaps just as im-
portant, though, is the instrument's own entertainment 
value; those that ar e bizarrely constructed or made of 
exotic mater ials are likely to leave a lasting impression 
on an audience. 
You might have an "off the rack" instrument, perhaps 
because it's all you can afford right now. Or, if your 
first instrument was gifted to you, it might be of a more 
elaborate sor t. Are you satisfied with the instrument you 
have, or do you aspire to replace it with something truly 
distinctive?

EMBARRASSMENT 
A lmost every bard has suffered at least one bad experi-
ence in front of an audience, and chances are you're no 
exception. No one becomes famous right away, after all; 
perhaps you had a few small difficulties early in your ca-
reer, or maybe it took you a while to restore your reputa-
tion after one agonizing night when the fates conspired 
to bring about your theatrical ruin.
