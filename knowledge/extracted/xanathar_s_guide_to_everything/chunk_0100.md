Disable the Statues. A statue can be disabled by 
blocking the flow of gas from its mouth. Heavily 
damaging a statue is a bad idea, for doing so leaves 
the gas vents open. Reducing a statue to 0 hit points 
(AC 17; 20 hp; resistance to fire, piercing, and 
s lashing damage; immune to poison and psychic 
damage) or making a successful DC 20 Strength 
check to break it cracks the statue and increases the 
Poison Gas damage by 5 (ldlO). A successful DC 20 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or a successful 
DC 15 Strength check made to block up the statue 
with a cloak or similar object, decreases the poison 
damage by 5 (ldlO). Once a character succeeds on 
the check, someone must remain next to the statue 
to keep it blocked up. When all four statues are 
blocked in this manner, the trap deactivates. 
DESIGNING COMPLEX TRAPS 
Creating a complex trap takes more work than building 
a simple one, but with some practice, you can learn the 
process and make it move quickly. 
Familiarize yourself with the advice on designing a 
simple trap before proceeding with the guidelines on 
complex traps. 
PURPOSE 
Complex traps are typically designed to protect an area 
by killing or disabling intruders. It is worth your time to 
consider who made the trap, the trap's purpose, and its 
desired result. Does the trap protect a treasure? Does it 
target only certain kinds of intruders? 
LEVEL AND LETHALITY 
Complex traps use the same level designations and 
lethality descriptors that simple traps do. Refer to that 
section for a discussion of how level and lethality help 
determine saving throw a nd check DCs, attack bonuses, 
and other numerical elements of a complex trap. 
MAP 
A complex trap has multiple parts, typically relies on 
the characters' positions to resolve some of its effects, 
and can bring several effects to bear in each round. 
The traps are called complex for a reason! To begin the 
design process, consider drawing a map of the area to 
be affected by the trap on graph paper, using a scale of 5 
feet per square. This level of detail allows you to develop 
a clear idea of what the trap can do and how each of its 
parts interact. Your map is the starting point and context 
for the rest of the design process. 
Don't limit yourself to one room. Look at the passages 
and rooms around the area of the trap and think about 
the role they can play. The trap might cause doors to 
lock and barriers to fall into place to prevent escape. 
It could cause darts to fire from the walls in one area, 
forcing characters to enter rooms where other devices 
trigger and threaten them. 
Consider how terrain and furniture can add to the 
trap's danger. A chasm or a pit might create a buffer that 
allows a trap to send bolts of magic at the characters, 
while making it difficult or even impossible for them to 
reach the runes they must deface to foil that attack. 
Think of your map like a script. Where do the charac-
ters want to go? What does the trap protect? How can 
the characters get there? What are their likely escape 
routes? Answering these questions tells you where the 
trap's various elements should be placed. 
ACTIVE ELEMENTS 
A complex trap's active elements work the same way as 
a simple trap's effects, except that a complex trap acti-
vates in every round. Otherwise, the guidelines for pick-
ing saving throw DCs, attack bonuses, and damage are 
the same. To make your trap logically consistent, make 
sure the elements you design can activate each round. 
For instance, ordinary crossbows rigged to fire at the 
characters would need a mechanfam for reloading them 
between attacks. 
In terms of lethality, it's better to have multiple dan-
gerous effects in a trap than a single deadly one. For 
example, the Path of Blades trap uses two dangerous 
elements and one moderate element. 
It's useful to create multiple active elements, with each 
affecting a different area. It's also a good idea to use 
a variety of effects. Some parts of the trap might deal 
damage, and others might immobilize characters or 
isolate them from the rest of the party. A bashing lever 
might knock characters into an area engulfed by jets of 
flame. Think about how the elements can work together. 
CONSTANT ELEMENTS 
In addition to the active steps a complex trap takes, it 
s hould also present a continual hazard. Often, the active 
and constant effects are the same thing. Imagine a hall-
way filled with whirling saw blades. On the trap's turn, 
the blades attack anyone in the hall. In addition, anyone 
who lingers in the hallway takes damage at the end of 
each of their turns, accounting for the constant threat 
that the blades pose. 
A constant element should apply its effect to any 
creature that ends its turn in that element's area. If an 
active element presents a threat when it isn't the trap's 
turn, define the threat it poses as a constant element. 
As a rule of thumb, keep the saving throw DC or attack 
bonus the same as for the active element but reduce the 
damage by half. 
Avoid filling the entire encounter area with constant 
elements. Part of the challenge of a complex trap lies in 
figuring out which areas are safe. A moment's respite 
can help add an element of pacing to an encounter with 
a complex trap and give the characters the feeling that 
they aren't in constant peril. For example, walls that 
s lam together might need to reset between slams, mak-
ing them harmless when it isn't their turn to act. 
DYNAMIC ELEMENTS 
Just as a battle is more interesting if the monsters 
change their tactics or unveil new abilities in later 
rounds, so too are complex traps more fun if their na-
ture changes in some way. The whirling blades that 
protect a treasure chest do more damage each round as 
they speed up. The poison gas in a room grows thicker 
as more of it floods the chamber, dealing greater dam-
age and affecting line of sight. The necrotic aura around 
an idol of Demogorgon produces random effects each
