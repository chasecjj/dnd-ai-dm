CHANNEL DIVINITY 
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the follow-
ing two Cha nnel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath 
class feature for how Channel Divinity works. 
Conquering Presence. You can use your Cha nnel 
Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, 
you force each creature of your choice that you can see 
with.in 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. 
On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you 
for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the 
effect on itself on a s uccess. 
Guided Strike. You can use your Cha nnel Divinity to 
strike with s upernatural accuracy. When you make an 
attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a 
+ 10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see 
the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits 
or misses. 
CHAPTER l I CHARACTER OPTIONS 
AURA OF CONQUEST 
Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing 
aura while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 
10 feet from you in every direction, but not through 
total cover. 
If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced 
to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic 
damage equa l to half your paladin level if it starts its 
turn there. 
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases 
to 30 feet. 
SCORNFUL REBUKE 
Starting at 15th level, those who dare to strike you are 
psychically punished for their audacity. Whenever a 
creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes 
psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (mini-
mum of 1) if you're not incapacitated. 
INVINCIBLE CONQUEROR 
At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordi-
nary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically 
become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following 
benefits for 1 minute: 
You have resistance to all damage. 
• When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can 
make one additiona l attack as part of that action. 
• Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a 
roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finis h a long rest. 
OATH OF R EDEMPTION 
The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult 
path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence 
only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves 
to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed 
and that the path of benevolence a nd justice is one that 
anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in 
the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay 
their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save 
other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as 
redeemers. 
While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Re-
deemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other 
supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against 
s uch foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full 
wrath of their weapons and s pells to bear. Yet the re-
deemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wick-
edness will invite their own redemption. 
TENETS OF REDEMPTION 
The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a 
high standard of peace and justice. 
Peace. Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy 
and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace. 
Innocence. All people begin life in an innocent state, 
and it is their environment or the influence of dark 
forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper 
example, a nd working to heal the wounds of a deeply 
flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.
