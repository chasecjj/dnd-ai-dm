lb INTRODUCTION 
ENEATH THE BUSTLING CITY OF WATERDEEP, 
a beholder crime lord keeps tabs on everyone 
and everything-or so the beholder thinks. 
Known as Xanathar, this bizarre being be-
lieves it can gather information on everything 
in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS multiverse. 
The beholder desires to know it all! But no 
matter what the beholder learns and what treasures it 
acquires, its most prized possession in all the multi-
verse remains its goldfish, Sylgar. 
The first major rules expansion to the fifth edition of 
D&D, Xanathar's Guide to Everything provides a wealth 
of new options for the game. Xanathar might not be able 
to realize its dream to know everything, but this book 
does delve into every major part of the game: adventur-
ers, their adventures, and the magic they wield. 
USING THIS BOOK 
Written for both players and Dungeon Masters, this 
book offers options to enhance campaigns in any world, 
whether you're adventuring in the Forgotten Realms, 
another official D&D setting, or a world of your own 
creation. T he options here build on the official rules 
contained within the Player's Handbook, the Monster 
Manual, a nd the Dungeon Master's Guide. Think of this 
book as the companion to those volumes. It builds on 
their foundation, exploring pathways first laid in those 
publications. Nothing herein is required for a D&D cam-
paign-this is not a fourth core rulebook- but we hope it 
will provide you new ways to enjoy the game. 
Chapter 1 offers character options that expand on 
those offered in the Player's Handbook. Chapter 2 is a 
toolkit for the DM that provides new resources for run-
ning the game and designing adventures, a ll of it build-
ing on the Monster Manual and the Dungeon Master's 
Guide. Chapter 3 presents new spells for player charac-
ters and spellcasting monsters to unleash. 
Appendix A provides guidance on running a shared 
campaign, similar to the activities staged by the D&D 
Adventurers League, and appendix B contains a host of 
tables that a llow you to quickly generate names for the 
characters in your D&D stories. 
As you peruse the many options herein, you'll come 
across observations from Xanathar itself. Like the 
beholder's roving mind, your reading will take you to 
places in the game familiar and new. May you enjoy 
the journey! 
U NEART H ED A RCA NA 
Much of the material in this book originally appeared in 
Unearthed Arcana, a series of online articles we publish 
to explore rules that might officially become part of the 
game. Some Unearthed Arcana offerings don't end up 
resonating with fans and are set aside for the time being. 
The Unearthed Arcana material that inspired the options 
in the following chapters was well received a nd, thanks to 
feedback from thousands of you, has been refined into the 
official forms presented here.

THE C O RE RULES 
This book relies on the rules in the three core rule-
books. The game especia lly ma kes frequent use of 
the rules in chapters 7- 10 of the Player's Handbook: 
"Using Ability S cores," "Adventuring," "Combat," a nd 
"Spellcasting." That book's appendix A is also crucial; 
it contains definitions of conditions, like invisible and 
prone. You don't need to know the rules by heart, but it's 
helpfuJ to know where to find them when you need them. 
If you're a DM, you should a lso know where to look 
things up in the Dungeon Master's Guide, especially the 
rules on how magic items work (see chapter 7 of that 
book). The introduction of the Monster Manual is your 
guide on how to use a monster's stat block. 
THE DM ADJUDICATES THE RULES 
One ruJe overrides all others: the DM is the final author-
ity on bow the rules work in play. 
Rules a re part of what makes D&D a game , rather 
tha n just improvised storytelling. The ga me's rules are 
meant to help organize, a nd even ins pire, the action of a 
D&D campaign. The rules a re a tool, a nd we want our 
tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good 
those tools might be, they need a group of players to 
bring them to life a nd a DM to guide their use. 
The DM is key. Ma ny unexpected events can occur in 
a D&D campaign, a nd no set of rules could reasonably 
account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, 
the game would become a slog. An alte rnative would be 
for the rules to severely lim it what characters can do, 
which would be contrary to the open-endedness of D&D. 
Here's the path the ga me ta kes: it lays a fou ndation of 
rules that a DM can build on, a nd it embraces the DM's 
role as the bridge between the things the rules address 
and the things they don't. 
TEN R ULES T O REMEMBER 
A few rules in the core rulebooks sometimes trip up a 
new player or DM. Here are ten of those rules. Keep-
ing them in mind will help you interpret the options in 
this book. 
EXCEPTIONS SUPERSEDE GENERAL RULES 
General rules govern each part of the game. For exam-
ple, the combat rules tell you that melee weapon attacks 
use Strength a nd ra nged weapon attacks use Dexterity. 
That's a general rule, and a genera l rule is in effect as 
long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say 
otherwise. 
The game also includes ele me nts- class features, 
s pells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like- that 
sometimes contradict a gene ral rule. When a n exception 
and a general rule disagree, the exception wins . For ex-
ample, if a feature says you can make melee weapon at-
tacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though 
that statement disagrees with the general rule. 
ROUND DOWN 
Whe never you divide or multiply a number in the game, 
round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the 
fraction is one-half or greater. 
ADVANTAGE AND DISADVA NTAGE 
Even if more than one factor gives you advantage or 
disadvantage on a roll, you have it only once, a nd if you 
have advantage and disadva ntage on the same roll, they 
cancel each other. 
C OMBINI NG D I FFERE NT EFFECTS 
Different game effects can affect a ta rget at the same 
time. For example, two different benefits can give you 
a bonus to your Armor Class. But when two or more 
effects have the same proper name, only one of them 
(the most powerful one if their bene fits a ren't identical) 
applies while the durations of the effects overlap. For ex-
ample, if bless is cast on you when you're still under the 
e ffect of an earlier bless, you gain the benefit of only one 
casting. S imila rly, if you're in the radius of more than 
one Aura of P rotection, you benefit only from the one 
that grants the highest bonus. 
R EACTION TIMING 
Certa in ga me features let you take a s pecial action, 
called a reaction, in response to some event. Making 
opportunity attacks and casting the shield spell are two 
typical uses of reactions. If you're unsure when a reac-
tion occurs in relation to its trigger, here's the rule: the 
reaction happens after its trigger completes, unless the 
description of the reaction explicitly says otherwise. 
Once you take a reaction, you can't ta ke a nother one 
until the sta rt of your next turn. 
RESISTANCE AND VULN ERABILITY 
Here's the order that you apply m odifiers to damage: (1) 
a ny relevant damage immunity, (2) any addition or sub-
traction to the damage, (3) one relevant damage resis-
tance, and (4) one relevant damage vulnerability. 
Even if multiple sources give you resista nce to a type 
of damage you're taking, you can apply resistance to it 
only once. The same is true of vulnerability. 
PROFICIENCY BONUS 
If your proficiency bonus a pplies to a roll, you can add 
the bonus only once to the roll, even if multiple things in 
the game say your bonus applies. Moreover, if more than 
one thing tells you to double or halve your bonus, you 
double it only once or halve it only once before apply-
ing it. Whether multiplied, divided, or left at its normal 
value, the bonus can be used only once per roll. 
BONUS ACTIQN SPELLS 
If you wa nt to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 
bonus action, remember that you can't cast any other 
s pells before or a fter it on the same turn, except for can-
trips with a casting time of 1 action. 
CONCENTRATION 
As soon as you start casting a s pell or using a s pecial 
ability that requires concentration, your concentration 
on another effect ends instantly. 
'TEMPORARY H IT POI NTS 
Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have tem-
porary hit points a nd receive more of them, you don't 
add them together, unless a gam e feature says you can. 
Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep.
