You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that 
you can see within range. An unwilling target must suc-
ceed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist the transforma-
tion. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds 
on the save. 
Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and 
you can choose the same form or different ones for each 
target. The new form can be any beast you have seen 
whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the tar-
get's (or half the target's level, if the target doesn't have a 
challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including 
mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of 
the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, 
alignment, and personality. 
Each target gains a number of temporary hit points 
equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary 
hit points can't be replaced by temporary bit points from 
another source. A target reverts to its normal form when 
it bas no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell 
ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit 
points and reverts to its norma l form. 
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by 
the nature of its new form. It can't speak , cast spells, or 
do anything else that requires hands or speech. 
The target's gear melds into the new form. The target 
can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any 
of its equipment. 
MAXIMILIAN'S EARTHEN GRASP 
2nd-level transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a miniature hand sculpted 
from clay) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the 
ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand 
made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for 
one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target 
must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, 
the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is re-
strained for the spell's duration. 
As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the 
restrained target, which must make a Strength saving 
throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a 
failed save, or ha lf as much damage on a successful one. 
To break out, the restrained target can use its action 
to make a Strength check against your s pell save DC. 
On a s uccess, the target escapes and is no longer re-
strained by the hand. 
As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a 
different creature or to move to a different unoccupied 
space within range. The hand releases a restrained tar-
get if you do either. 
MELF
1S MINUTE METEORS 
3rd-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V, S, M (niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed 
into a bead) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float 
in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When 
you cast the spell- and as a bonus action on each of 
your turns thereafter- you can expend one or two of 
the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or 
points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a me-
teor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid 
surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 
feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make 
a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire 
damage on a fai led save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors 
created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd. 
MENTAL PRISON 
6th-level illusion 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: S 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell 
that only it perceives. One creature you can see within 
range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The 
target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being 
charmed. On a successful save, the target takes SdlO 
psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, 
the target takes SdlO psychic damage, and you make 
the area immediately around the target's space appear 
dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the ta rget 
to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating 
razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. 
Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see or 
hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spell's 
duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes 
a melee attack through it, or reaches a ny part of its body 
through it, the target takes lOdlO psychic damage, and 
the spell ends. 
MIGHTY FORTRESS 
8th-level conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 1 mile 
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes) 
Duration: Instantaneous 
A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground 
of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 
120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings 
or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are 
harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises. 
The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each 
one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on 
each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by 
stone walls that a re each 80 feet long, creating an en-
