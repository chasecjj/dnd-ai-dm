Seeking Arrow. Using divination magic, you grant 
your arrow the ability to seek out a target. When you use 
this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. 
Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past 
minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving 
around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters 
cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's 
range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to 
travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity 
saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after 
traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target 
takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 
1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current 
location. On a successful save, the target takes half as 
much damage, and you don't learn its location. 
The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 
18th level in this class. 
Shadow Arrow. You weave illusion magic into your 
arrow, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shad-
ows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 
psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom 
saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 
feet away until the start of your next turn. 
The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 
18th level in this class. 
CAVALIER 
The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. 
Usua lly born among the nobility and raised at court, a 
Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or 
exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also 
learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, 
often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of 
the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, 
many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to em-
bark on glorious adventure.

BONUS PROFICIENCY 
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: 
Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or 
Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of 
your choice. 
BORN TO THE SADDLE 
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes 
apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made 
to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount 
and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your 
feet if you're not incapacitated. 
Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you 
only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed. 
CHAPTER l I CHAR.',CTER OPTIONS 
CAVALIERS, SAMURAI , AND HISTORY 
While both cavaliers and samurai existed in the real world, 
our inspirations for both fighter archetypes are taken from 
popular culture (folk tales, movies, and comic books), not 
from history. Our intent is to capture the cinematic, heroic 
element of both archetypes in the game, rather than create 
an accurate historical representation of either one. 
UNWAVERING MARK 
Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling 
their attacks and punishing them for harming others. 
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, 
you can mark the creature until the end of your next 
turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or 
you die, or if someone else marks the creature. 
While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by 
you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't 
target you. 
In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage 
to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee 
weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus 
action on your next turn. You have advantage on the 
attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's weapon deals extra 
damage to the target equa l to half your fighter level. 
Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you 
can make this special attack a number of times equal to 
your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you re-
gain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. 
WARDING MANEUVER 
At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at 
you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or 
a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an 
attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding 
a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the 
number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If 
the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the 
attack's damage. 
You can use this feature a number of times equal 
to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and 
you regain a ll expended uses of it when you finish a 
long rest. 
HOLD THE LINE 
At 10th level, you become a master of locking down 
your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack 
from you when they move 5 feet or more while within 
your reach, and if you hit a creature with a n opportunity 
attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of 
the current turn.
