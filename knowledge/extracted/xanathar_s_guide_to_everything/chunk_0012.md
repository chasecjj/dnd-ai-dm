CLERIC 
TO BECOME A CLERJC IS TO BECOME A MESSENGER OF 
the gods. The power the divine offers is great, but it always 
comes with tremendous responsibility. 
-Riggby the patriar ch 
Almost all the folk in the world who revere a deity live 
their lives without ever being directly touched by a di-
vine being. As such, they can never know what it feels 
like to be a cleric- someone who is not only a devout 
wors hiper, but who has a lso been invested with a mea-
s ure of a deity's power. 
The question has long been debated: Does a mortal 
become a cleric as a consequence of deep devotion to 
one's deity, thereby attracting the god's favor? Or is it the 
deity who sees the potential in a person and calls that 
individual into service? Ultimately, perhaps, the answer 
does n't matter. However clerics come into being, the 
world needs clerics as much as clerics and deities need 
each other. 
If you're playing a cleric character, the following sec-
tions offer ways to add some detail to that character's 
his tory and personality. 
TEMPLE 
Most clerics start their lives of service as priests in an 
order, then later realize that they have been blessed by 
their god with the qualities needed to become a cleric. 
To prepare for this new duty, candidates typically re-
ceive instruction from a cleric of a temple or another 
place of study devoted to their deity. 
Some temples are cut off from the world so that their 
occupants can focus on devotions, while other temples 
open their doors to minis ter to and heal the masses. 
What is noteworthy about the temple you studied at?

KEEPSAKE 
Many clerics have items a mong their personal gear that 
symbolize their faith, remind them of their vows, or oth-
erwise help to keep them on their chosen paths. Even 
though s uch an item is not imbued with divine power, 
it is vitally important to its owner because of what it 
represents.

SECRET 
No mortal soul is entirely free of second thoughts or 
doubt. Even a cleric must grapple with dark desires or 
the forbidden attraction of turning against the teachings 
of one's deity. 
If you haven't considered this aspect of your charac-
ter yet, see the table entries for some possibilities, or 
use them for inspiration. Your deep, dark secret might 
involve something you did (or are doing), or it could 
be rooted in the way you feel about the world and your 
role in it.

An imp offers you counsel. You try to ignore the 
creattJre, but sometimes its advice is helpful. 
You believe that, in the final analysis, the gods are 
nothing more than ultrapowerful mortal creatures. 
You acknowledge the power of the gods, but you 
think that most events are dictated by pure chance. 
Even though you can work divine magic, you have 
never tru ly felt the presence of a divine essence 
within yourself. 
You are plagued by nightmares that you believe are 
sent by your god as punishment for some unknown 
transgression. 
In times of despair, you feel that you are but a play-
thing of the gods, and you resent their remoteness.
