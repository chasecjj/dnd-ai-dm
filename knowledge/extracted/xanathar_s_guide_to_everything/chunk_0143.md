COMBAT ENCOUNTERS 
Design your adventure for one of the four tiers, as set 
forth in chapter 1 of the Player's Handbook: tier 1 in-
cludes levels 1- 4, tier 2 is levels 5- 10, tier 3 is levels 
11-16, and tier 4 includes levels 17- 20. Within each tier, 
it's a good idea to use a specific level as a starting point. 
Assume a party of five 3rd-level characters for tier 1, five 
8th-level characters for tier 2, five 13th-level characters 
for tier 3, and five 18th-level characters for tier 4. Use 
that assumption when creating combat encounters, 
whether you use the encounter-building rules in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide or are making an estimate. 
For each battle, provide guidelines to help DMs adjust 
the difficulty up or down to match stronger or weaker 
parties. As a rule of thumb, account for a party two 
levels higher and for a party two levels lower, and don't 
worry about balancing the adventure for parties outside 
the adventure's tier. 
REWARDS 
Adventures in a shared campaign that uses variant rules 
for gaining levels and acquiring treas ure (such as those 
described below) don't include experience point awards 
or specific amounts and kinds of treasure. 
CHARACTER CREATION 
A shared campaign's guidelines for cha racter creation 
might include definition of which races and classes 
players can choose from, how players generate ability 
scores, and which alignments players can choose. 
PLAYER'S HANDBOOK PLUS ONE 
You should think about which products players can use 
to create a character. The Adventurers League specifies 
that a player can use the Player's Handbook and one 
other official D&D source, such as a book or a PDF, to 
create a character. This restriction ens ures that players 
don't need to own a lot of books to make a cha racter 
and makes it easier for DMs to know how all the char-
acters in the campaign work. Since a DM in a shared 
campaign must deal with a broad range of characters, 
rather than the same characters each week, it can be dif-
ficult to track all the interactions and abilities possible 
through mixing options freely. We strongly recommend 
this rule for any shared campaign. 
ABILITY SCORES 
For generating ability scores, we recommend allowing 
players to choose between the standard array- 15, 14, 
13, 12, 10, 8-and the option presented in "Variant: 
Customizing Ability Scores" in chapter 1 of the Play-
er's Handbook. 
STARTING EQUIPMENT 
For the sake of simplicity and efficiency, it's a good 
idea to require that beginning characters must take the 
starting equipment specified by a character's class a nd 
background. 
VARIANT RULES 
A shared campaign might use some variant rules to 
handle certain aspects of the game. The Adventurers 
League, for instance, has variant systems for gaining 
levels and acquiring treasure. These "house rules," 
presented below, serve as a sort of common language, 
ensuring that the rewards all characters receive are 
equivalent no matter what kind of adventure a character 
experienced. 
CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT 
~~~~~~~~-
In a shared campaign, characters gain levels not by 
accumulating experience points but by reaching experi-
ence checkpoints. This system rewards every character 
(and player) for taking part in a play session. 
A character reaches 1 checkpoint for each hour an 
adventure is designed to last. Note that the award is 
based on the adventure's projected playing time, rather 
than the actual time spent at the table. The reward for 
completing an adventure designed for 2 hours of play is 
2 checkpoints, even if a group spends more than 2 hours 
playing through it. 
If a character completes an adventure designed for a 
tier higher than the character's current tier, the char-
acter is awarded 1 additional checkpoint. For example, 
if a 2nd-level character completes a 6th-level adven-
ture designed to take 2 hours, the character reaches 3 
checkpoints. 
P laying time might seem like a n odd way to measure 
experience awards, but the concept is in keeping with 
how a shared campaign is meant to work. A character 
played for 10 hours reaches the same number of check-
points, whether the character went up against a dragon 
or spent all that time lurking in a pub. This approach en-
sures that a player's preferred style is neither penalized 
nor rewarded. Whether someone focuses on roleplaying 
and social interaction, defeating monsters in combat, 
or finding clever ways to avoid battles, this system gives 
credit where credit is due. 
USING CHECKPOINTS 
The number of checkpoints needed to gain the next level 
depends on a character's level: 
• At levels 1- 4, reaching 4 checkpoints is sufficient to 
advance to the next level. 
• At level 5 or higher, reaching 8 checkpoints is needed 
to advance to the next level. 
At the end of a play session, characters must level up 
if they have reached enough checkpoints to do so. The 
required number of checkpoints is expended, and any 
remaining checkpoints are applied toward the next op-
portunity for advancement. 
INDIVIDUAL TREASURE 
In a shared campaign, each character receives a fixed 
number of gold pieces upon gaining a new level. (This 
gain represents the treasure a character might find in a 
standard adventure.) 
As an additional benefit, characters are not required 
to put out gold to maintain a lifestyle. Instead, each char-
