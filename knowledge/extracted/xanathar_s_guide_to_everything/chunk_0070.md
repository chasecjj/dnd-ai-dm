SPELLCASTING 
This section expands on the spellcasting rules pre-
sented in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Mas-
ter's Guide, providing clarifications and new options. 
PERCEIVING A CASTER AT WORK 
Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, 
walls of ice, teleportation, and the like. Other spells, 
such as charm person, display no visible, audible, or oth-
erwise perceptible s ign of their effects, and could easily 
go unnoticed by someone una ffected by them. As noted 
in the Player's Handbook, you normally don't know that 
a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a notice-
able effect. 
But what about the act of casting a spell? Is it possible 
for someone to perceive that a spell is being cast in their 
presence? To be perceptible, the casting of a spell must 
involve a verbal, somatic, or material component. The 
form of a material component doesn't matter for the 
purposes of perception, whether it's an object specified 
in the spell's description, a component pouch, or a spell-
casting focus. 
If the need for a spell's components has been removed 
by a special ability, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell 
feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by 
many creatures, the casting of the s pell is imperceptible. 
If an imperceptible casting produces a perceptible ef-
fect, it's normally impossible to determine who cast the 
spell in the absence of other evidence. 
IDENTIFYING A SPELL 
Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that 
someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do 
so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell 
as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn 
to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast. 
If the character perceived the casting, the spell's ef-
fect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (Ar-
cana) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 
15 + the spel l's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell 
and the character is a member of that class, the check 
is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster 
casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on 
the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't asso-
ciated with any class when they're cast, such as when a 
monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait. 
This Intelligence (Arcana) check represents the fact 
that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and famil-
iarity with.the theory and practice of casting. This is 
true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is 
Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't 
by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others 
are doing when they cast their spells. 
INVALID SPELL TARGETS 
A spell specifies what a caster can target with it: any 
type of creature, a creature of a certain type (humanoid 
or beast, for instance), an object, an area, the caster, 
or something else. But w hat happens if a spell tar-
gets something that isn't a valid target? For example,
