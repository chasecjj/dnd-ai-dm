Magic Kensei Weap ons. Your attacks with your ken· 
sei weapons count as magical for the purpose of over· 
coming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks 
and damage. 
Deft Strik e. When you hit a target with a kensei 
weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon 
to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial 
Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of 
your turns. 
SHARPEN THE BLADE 
At 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weap-
ons further with your ki. As a bonus action, you can 
expend up to 3 ki points to grant one kensei weapon 
you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you 
attack with it. The bonus equals the number of ki points 
you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you 
use this feature again. This feature has no effect on a 
magic weapon that already has a bonus to attack a nd 
damage rolls. 
UNERRING ACCURACY 
At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you ex-
traordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll 
using a monk weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You 
can use this feature only once on each of your turns. 
WAY OF THE SUN SOUL 
Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their 
life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach that 
meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the indomi-
table light shed by the soul of every living creature.

R ADIANT SUN BOLT 
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you 
can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance. 
You gain a new attack option that you can use with 
the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell 
attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with 
it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and 
damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, and its damage die 
is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as 
shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. 
When you take the Attack action on your turn and use 
this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 ki point 
to make the special attack twice as a bonus action. 
When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special 
attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as 
part of the Attack action. 
SEARING ARC STRIKE 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into 
searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the 
Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki points to 
cast the burning hands s pell as a bonus action. 
You can spend additiona l ki points to cast burning 
hands as a higher-level spell. Each additional ki point 
you s pend increases the s pell's level by 1. The maximum 
number of ki points (2 plus any additional points) that 
you can s pend on the spell equa ls half your monk level. 
SEARING SU NBU RST 
At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light 
that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, 
you magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you 
choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of 
radiant Light for a brief but deadly instant. 
Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must suc-
ceed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant 
damage. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the 
creature is behind total cover that is opaque. 
You can increase the sphere's damage by spending 
ki points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, in-
creases the damage by 2d6. 
SUN SHIELD 
At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous, mag-
ical aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and 
dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or 
restore the light as a bonus action. 
If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this 
light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant 
damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + 
your Wisdom modifier.
