Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore 
a number of hit points equal to the total. 
Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a 
long rest. 
RADIANT SOUL 
Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows 
you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have 
resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell 
that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Cha-
risma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that 
spell against one of its targets. 
CELESTIAL RESILIENCE 
Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points 
whenever you finish a short or long rest. These tempo-
rary hit points equal your warlock level+ your Charisma 
modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you 
can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain 
temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + 
your Charisma modifier. 
SEARING VENGEANCE 
Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel 
allows you to resist death. When you have to make a 
death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can 
instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant 
energy. You regain hit points equal to hal f your hit point 
maximum, and then you stand up i f you so choose. Each 
creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes 
radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, 
and it is blinded until the end of the current turn. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 
THE HEXBLADE 
You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from 
the Shadowfell- a force that manifests in sentient magic 
weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty 
sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, 
which have been spread across the multiverse over the 
ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can 
offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many 
hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those 
formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, 
content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their 
spellcasting. 
Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the 
first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she 
and the force are one and that the weapons, along with 
hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate 
events on the Ma.terial Plane to her inscrutable ends.

HEXBLADE'S CURSE 
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a bale-
ful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one 
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is 
cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target 
dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse 
ends, you gain the following benefits: 
• You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed 
target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus. 
• Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a 
critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. 
• If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal 
to your warlock level +your Charisma modifier (mini-
mum of 1 hit point). 
You can't use this feature again until you finish a short 
or long rest. 
HExWARRIOR 
At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effec-
tively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with 
medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. 
The influence of your patron also allows you to mys-
tically channel your will through a particular weapon. 
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one 
weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks 
the two-handed property. When you attack with that 
weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of 
Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. 
This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later
