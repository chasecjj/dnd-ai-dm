When you finish a long rest during which you slept in 
medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of 
your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have 
any levels of exhaustion, the rest doesn't reduce your 
exhaustion level. 
GOING WITHOUT A LONG REST 
A long rest is never ma ndatory, but going without sleep 
does have its consequences. If you want to account for 
the effects of sleep deprivation on characters and crea-
tures, use these rules. 
Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing 
a long rest, you must s ucceed on a DC 10 Constitution 
saving throw or s uffer one level of exhaustion. 
It becomes harder to fight off exhaustion if you stay 
awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the 
DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period 
without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish 
a long rest. 
ADAMANTINE WEAPONS 
Adamantine is an ultrahard metal found in meteorites 
and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being 
used to craft adamantine armor, the metal is a lso used 
for weapons. 
Melee weapons and ammunition made of or coated 
with adamantine are unusually effective when used 
to break objects. Whenever an adamantine weapon 
or piece of ammunition hits a n object, the hit is a 
critical hit. 
The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of 
ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the 
normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is 
made of the metal or coated with it. 
TYING KNOTS 
The rules are purposely open-ended concerning mun-
dane tasks like tying knots, but sometimes knowing 
how well a knot was fashioned is important in a dra-
matic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or 
slip out of one. Here's an optional rule for determining 
the effectiveness of a knot. 
The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence 
(Sleight of Hand) check when doing so. The total of the 
check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot 
with an Intelligence (Sleight of Hand) check or to slip 
out of it with a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
This rule intentionally links Sleight of Hand with 
Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example 
of how to apply the rule in the "Varia nt: Skills with 
Different Abilities" section in chapter 7 of the Play-
er's Handbook. 
TOOL PROFICIENCIES 
Tool proficiencies are a useful way to highlight a charac-
ter's background and talents. At the game table, though, 
the use of tools sometimes overlaps with the use of 
skills, and it can be unclear bow to use them together in 
certain situations. This section offers various ways that 
tools can be used in the game. 
TOOLS AND SKILLS TOGETHER 
Tools have more s pecific applications than skills. The 
History skill applies to any event in the past. A tool such 
as a forgery kit is used to make fake objects and little 
else. Thus, why would a character who has the opportu-
nity to acquire one or the other want to gain a tool profi-
ciency instead of proficiency in a skill? 
To make tool proficiencies more attractive choices for 
the characters, you can use the methods outlined below. 
Advantage. If the use of a tool and the use of a skill 
both apply to a check, and a character is proficient with 
the tool and the skill, consider allowing the character 
to make the check with advantage. This simple benefit 
can go a long way toward encouraging players to pick 
up tool proficiencies. In the tool descriptions that follow, 
this benefit is often expressed as additional insight (or 
something similar), which translates into a n increased 
chance that the check will be a success. 
Added Benefit. In addition, consider giving characters 
who have both a relevant skill and a relevant tool profi-
ciency an added benefit on a s uccessful check. This ben-
efit might be in the form of more detailed information or 
could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful 
check. For example, a character proficient with mason's 
tools makes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to 
find a secret door in a stone wall. Not only does the char-
acter notice the door's presence, but you decide that the 
tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic 
success on an Intelligence (Investigation) check to deter-
mine how to open the door. 
TOOL DESCRIPTIONS 
The following sections go into detail about the tools pre-
sented in the Player's Handbook, offering advice on how 
to use the m in a campaign. 
Components. The first paragraph in each description 
gives details on what a set of supplies or tools is made 
up of. A character who is proficient with a tool knows 
how to use all of its component parts. 
Skills. Every tool potentially provides advantage on a 
check when used in conjunction with certain skills, pro-
vided a character is proficient with the tool a nd the skill. 
As DM, you can allow a character to make a check using 
the indicated skill with advantage. Paragraphs that be-
gin with skill names discuss these possibilities. In each 
of these paragraphs, the benefits apply only to someone 
who has proficiency with the tool, not someone who sim-
ply owns it. 
With respect to skills, the system is mildly abstract in 
terms of what a tool proficiency represents; essentially, 
it assumes that a character who has proficiency with a 
tool also has learned about facets of the trade or pro-
fession that are not necessarily associated with the use 
of the tool. 
In addition, you can consider giving a character extra 
information or an added benefit on a skill check. The 
text provides some examples a nd ideas when this oppor-
tunity is relevant. 
Special Use. Proficiency with a tool usually brings 
with it a particula r benefit in the form of a special use, 
as described in this paragraph.
