TRAINING 
Giveo enough free time and the services of an instruc-
tor, a character can learn a language or pick up profi-
ciency with a tool. 
Resources. Receiving training in a language or tool 
typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is 
reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the cha r-
acter's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty 
doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp 
per workweek. 
Complications. Complications that arise while train-
ing typically involve the teacher. Every ten workweeks 
spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a compli-
cation, examples of which are on the Training Complica-
tions table.

WORK 
When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest 
trade to earn a living. This activity represents a char-
acter's attempt to find temporary work, the quality and 
wages of which are difficult to predict. 
Resources. Performing a job requires one workweek 
of effort. 
Resolution. To determine how much money a char-
acter earns, the character makes an ability check: 
Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), Intelligence 
using a set of tools, Charisma (Performance), or Cha-
risma using a musical instrument. Consult the Wages 
table to see how much money is generated according to 
the total of the check.

Complications. Ordinary work is rarely filled with 
significant complications. Still, the Work Complications 
table can add some difficulties to a worker's life. Each 
workweek of activity brings a 10 percent chance that a 
character encounters a complication.
