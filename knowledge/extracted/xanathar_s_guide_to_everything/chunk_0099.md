briefly appears and teleports the sphere back to the top 
of the slope to begin the process again. 
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative count 10 (but see 
the dynamic element below). 
Active Element. AJthough the trap is complex in na-
ture, it has a single active element. That's all it needs. 
Sphere of Crushing Doom (Initiative 10). The trap's 
active element is a sphere of steel that almost fills 
the 10-foot width of the hallway and rolls to the 
bottom of the slope on its turn. Each creature in 
the sphere's path must ma ke a DC 20 Strength 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 
(4dl0) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. 
On a s uccessful save, a creature ta kes half as much 
damage and isn't knocked prone. Objects that block 
the sphere, such as a conjured wall, take maximum 
damage from the impact. 
Dynamic Element. The longer it rolls, the more lethal 
the sphere becomes. 
Speed Kills. After its turn, the sphere gains speed, 
represented by its da mage increasing by 11 (2d10). 
While its damage is 55 (lOdlO) or greater, it acts on 
initiative count 20 and 10. 
Countermeasures. The trap can be neutralized either 
by stopping the sphere or preventing it from teleporting. 
Stop the Sphere. Stopping the sphere is the easiest 
way to disrupt the trap. A wall of force can do so 
easily, as can any object placed in its path that has 
enough hit points to absorb damage from the sphere 
without being destroyed. 
Disrupt the Portals. Either portal can be neutra lized 
with three successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) 
checks, but the process of analyzing a portal to 
disrupt it takes time. Faint runes in the ceiling and 
floor at both ends of the hallway are involved in the 
functioning of the portals. A creature must first 
use an action to examine a set of runes, then use a 
s ubsequent action to attempt to vandalize the runes. 
Each successful check reduces the sphere's damage 
by 11 (2d10), as the disrupted sphere loses speed 
moving through the failing portal. 
AJternatively, a set of runes can be disabled with 
three successful castings of dispel m agic (DC 19) 
targeting any of the runes in the set. 
If the southern portal is destroyed, the sphere 
slams into the south wall and comes to a halt. It 
blocks the door to the tomb, but the characters 
can escape. 
POISONED TEMPEST 
Complex trap (level 11- 16, deadly threat) 
This fiendis h trap was built to eliminate intruders who 
infiltrate a yuan-ti temple. The trap is a room, 60 feet 
on a side, with 5-foot-wide stone doors in the middle of 
each wall. In each corner of the room stands a 10-foot-
tall statue of a great serpent, coiled and ready to strike. 
The eyes in each statue are rubies worth 200 gp apiece. 
Trigger. This trap activates when a ruby is pried from 
one of the statues. Each statue's mouth slides open, re-
vealing a 1-foot-wide pipe that runs down its throat. 
CHAPTER 2 1 DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS 
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative count 20 and ini-
tiative count 10. 
Active Elements. The trap fills the room with poison 
and other deadly effects. 
Locked Doors (Initiative 20). The four doors to this 
room slam shut and are locked in place by magic. 
This effect activates only once, the first time the trap 
is triggered. 
Poison Gas (Initiative 20). Poison gas floods the 
room. Each creature inside must make a DC 20 
Constitution saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) poison 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on 
a successful one. 
Tempest (Initiative 10). Air and gas boils from the 
trap. Roll a d6, and cons ult the following table. 
TEMPEST EFFECTS 
d6 
2 
Effect 
Hallucinatory gas scrambles the mind and senses. 
All Intelligence and Wisdom checks made in the 
room have disadvantage until the Tempest element 
activates again. 
Explosive gas fills the area. If anyone holds an open 
flame, it causes an explosion. All creatures in the 
area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or 
half as much damage on a successful one. The 
flame is then extinguished. 
3 
Weakening gas fills the room. All Strength and Dex-
terity checks made in the room have disadvantage 
until the Tempest element activates again. 
4 
Buffeting winds force each creature in the room to 
succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be 
knocked prone. 
5 
Smoke fills the room. Visibility is reduced to 1 foot 
until the next time the Tempest element activates. 
6 
Poison floods the room, forcing creatures to make 
saving throws as for the Poison Gas element. 
Dynamic Element. The longer the poison gas re-
mains in the room, the more lethal it becomes. 
Increased Potency. The damage from the Poison Gas 
element increases by 11 (2d10) each round after it 
activates, to a maximum of 55 (10d10). 
Countermeasures. There are a few ways that the trap 
can be overcome. 
Open the Doors. Opening the doors is the quickest 
way to circumvent the trap, but they are warded with 
magic. To open the doors, a character must first 
succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to 
find the locking mechanism. A successful DC 20 In-
telligence (Arcana) check is then required to disable 
the sphere of force that surrounds the lock (dispel 
magic is ineffective against it). Success on a DC 20 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools picks the lock. 
Finally, a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) 
check is needed to push the door open. Each check 
requires an action.
