SIGNATURE STYLE 
Many fighters distinguish themselves from their peers 
by adopting and perfecting a particular style or method 
of waging combat. Although this style might be a natural 
outgrowth of a fighter's personality, that's not always the 
case- someone's approach to the world in general does 
not necessarily dictate how that person operates when 
lives are on the line. 
Do you have a combat style that mirrors your outlook 
on life, or is something else inside you unleashed when 
weapons are drawn? 
SIGNATURE STYLES

Elegant. You move with precise grace and total 
control, never using mo re energy than you need.

Brutal. Your attacks rain down like ha mmer blows, 
meant to splinter bone or send blood flying.

your favor. 
Effortless. You ra rely perspire or display anything 
other than a stoic expression in battle. 
Energetic. You sing and laugh d uring combat as 
your spi rit soars. You are happiest when you have a 
foe in front of you and a weapon in hand. 
Sinister. You scowl and s neer while fighti ng, and 
you enjoy mocking your foes as you defeat them. 
MARTIAL ARCHETYPES 
At 3rd level, a fighter gains the Martial Archetype fea-
ture. The following options are available to a fighter, in 
addition to those offered in the Player's Handbook: the 
Arcane Archer, the Cavalier, and the S amurai. 
ARCANE ARCHER 
An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of 
archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce su-
pernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most 
elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over 
the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for 
trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat 
monsters and invaders before they can reach elven set-
tlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf 
archers have been learned by members of other races 
who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.

A RCANE A RCH ER LORE 
At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the 
secrets of nature-typical for practitioners of this elven 
martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in ei-
ther the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to 
learn either the prestidigitation or the druidcraft cantrip. 
A RCANE SHOT 
At 3rd level, you learn to unleash s pecia l magical effects 
with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you 
learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see "Ar-
cane S hot Options" below). 
Once per turn when you fire a magic arrow from a 
shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you 
can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that ar-
row. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits 
a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack 
roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all 
expended uses of it when you fi nish a short or long rest. 
You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your 
choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 
10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves 
when you become an 18th-level fighter. 
M AGIC AR ROW 
At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with 
magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical a rrow from a 
shortbow or longbow, you ca n make it magical for the 
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-
magical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the 
arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target. 
CURVING SHOT 
At 7th level, you learn how to direct a n errant arrow 
toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with 
a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to 
reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 
feet of the original target. 
E VER-RE ADY S H OT 
S tarting at 15th level, your magical archery is available 
whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative a nd have no 
uses of Arcane S hot remaining, you regain one use of it. 
A RCANE S H OT 0PT10N S 
The Arcane S hot feature lets you choose options for it at 
cer tain levels. The options are presented here in alpha-
betical order. They ar e all magical effects, and each one 
is associated with one of the schools of magic. 
If a n option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot 
save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelli-
gence modifier.
