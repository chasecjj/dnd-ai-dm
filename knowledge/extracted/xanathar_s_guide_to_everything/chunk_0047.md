ECCENTRICITY 
Endless hours of solitary study and research can have 
a negative effect on anyone's social skills. Wizards, who 
a re a breed apart to begin with, are no exception. An 
odd mannerism or two is not necessarily a drawback, 
though; an eccentricity of this sort is usually harmless 
and could provide a source of amusement or serve as a 
calling card of sorts. 
If your character has an eccentricity, is it a physical 
tic or a mental one? Are you well known in some circles 
because of it? Do you fight to overcome it, or do you em-
brace this minor claim to fame of yours? 
ECCENTRICITI ES

Eccentricity 
You have the habit of tapping your foot incessantly, 
which often annoys those around you. 
2 
Your memory is quite good, but you have no trou-
ble pretending to be absentminded when it suits 
your purposes. 
3 
You never enter a room without looking to see 
what's hanging from the ceiling. 
4 
Your most prized possession is a dead worm that 
you keep inside a potion vial. 
5 
When you want people to leave you alone, you start 
talking to yourself. That usually does the trick. 
6 
Your fashion sense and grooming, o r more ac-
curately lack thereof, sometimes cause others to 
assume you are a beggar. 
ARCANE TRADITION 
At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition fea-
ture. The following War Magic option is available to a 
wizard, in addition to the options offered in the Play-
er's Handbook. 
WAR MAGIC 
A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wiz-
ards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends princi-
ples of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializ-
ing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that 
empower a caster's spells, while also providing methods 
for wizards to bolster their own defenses. 
Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. 
They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a re-
source superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast 
in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a 
situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive 
skills foil their opponents' attempts to counterattack. 
War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' 
magical energy against them. 
In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, 
abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in par-
ticular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their 
attention between offense and defense. A war mage's 
typical response: "What good is being able to throw a 
mighty fireball if I die before I can cast it?"

than cantrips until the end of your next turn.
