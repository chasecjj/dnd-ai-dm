closed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of 
panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel 
is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel 
and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the 
fortress's outer wall. 
A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The 
keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and 
it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the 
floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, 
provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The 
floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its 
walls are 6 inches thick, a nd interior rooms can have 
stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep 
is furnished and decorated however you like, and it con-
tains s ufficient food to serve a nine-course ba nquet for 
up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other 
objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed 
from the fortress. 
A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any 
command given to them by creatures you designate 
when you cast the s pell. Each servant functions as if cre-
ated by the unseen servant spell. 
The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone 
that can be da maged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of 
stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. 
It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing 
a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might 
cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the 
DM's discretion. 
After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere 
else, the fortress ha rmlessly crumbles and sinks back 
MI GHTY F O RTRESS 
into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it 
safely on the ground. 
Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days 
for a year makes the fortress permanent.

You reach into the mind of one creature you can see 
within range. The target must m ake a Wisdom saving 
throw, taking 3d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or 
half as much damage on a s uccessful one. On a failed 
save, you also always know the target's location until the 
spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same 
plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the 
target can't become hidden from you, and if it's invisible, 
it gains no benefit from that condition against you. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 
ld6 for each slot level above 2nd.
