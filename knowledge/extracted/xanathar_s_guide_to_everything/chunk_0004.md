BARBARIAN 
I HAVE WITNESSED THE INDOMITABLE PERFORMANCE OF 
barbarians on the.field of battle, and it makes me wonder 
what force lies at the heart of their rage. 
-Seret, archwizard 
The anger felt by a normal person resembles the rage of 
a barbarian in the same way that a gentle breeze is akin 
to a furious thunderstorm. The barbarian's driving force 
comes from a place that transcends mere emotion, mak-
ing its manifestation a ll the more terrible. Whether the 
impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from 
forging a Link with a s pirit animal, a raging barbarian 
becomes able to perform supernatural feats of strength 
and endurance. The outburst is temporary, but while it 
lasts, it takes over body a nd mind, driving the barbarian 
on despite peril and injury, until the last enemy falls. 
It can be tempting to play a barbarian character that 
is a straightforward application of the classic arche-
type- a brute, and us ually a dimwitted one at that, who 
rushes in where others fear to tread. But not all the 
barbarians in the world are cut from that cloth, so you 
can certainly put your own spin on things. Either way, 
consider adding some f:lourishes to make your barbarian 
stand out from a ll others; see the following sections for 
some ideas. 
PERSONAL TOTEMS 
Barbarians tend to travel light, carrying little in the way 
of personal effects or other unnecessary gear. The few 
possessions they do carry often include sma ll items that 
have special significance. A personal totem is significant 
because it has a mystical origin or is tied to an import-
ant moment in the character's life- perhaps a remem-
brance from the barbarian's past or a harbinger of what 
lies ahead. 
A personal totem of this sort might be associated with 
a barbarian's spirit a nimal, or might actually be the to-
tem object for the animal, but such a connection is not 
essential. One who has a bear totem spirit, for instance, 
could still carry an eagle's feather as a personal totem. 
Consider creating one or more personal totems for 
your character- objects that hold a special link to your 
character's past or future. Think about how a totem 
might affect your cha racter's actions.

TATTOOS 
The members of many barbarian clans decorate their 
bodies with tattoos, each of which represents a signif-
icant moment in the life of the bearer or the bearer's 
ancestors, or which symbolizes a feeling or an attitude. 
As with personal totems, a barbarian's tattoos might or 
might not be related to an a nimal s pirit. 
Each tattoo a barbarian displays contributes to that in-
dividual's identity. If your character wears tattoos, what 
do they look like, and what do they represent?

SUPERSTITIONS 
Barbarians vary widely in how they understand life. 
Some follow gods and look for guidance from those 
deities in the cycles of nature a nd the a nimals they en-
counter. These barbarians believe that spirits inhabit 
the plants and a nimals of the world, and the barbarians 
look to them for omens and power. 
Other barbarians trust only in the blood that runs in 
their veins a nd the steel they hold in their hands. They 
have no use for the invisible world, instead relying on 
their senses to hunt and survive like the wild beasts 
they emulate.
