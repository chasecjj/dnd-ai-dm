MARINA'S PLANS 
Element 
Description 
Event 
Rats become a noticeable problem in the streets, 
with swarms sighted in rundown neighborhoods. 
Folk demand that action be taken. 
Action 
Caravan raids by goblinoids become more com-
mon, and folk talk of gathering a militia. Marina 
contributes generously to the effort. 
Action 
Warehouses are overrun with rats, ruining thou-
sands of gold pieces worth of goods. Marina 
blames the city for a lax effort in pest control. 
Action 
Event 
Action 
If the characters interfere, Marina sends her as-
sassins against them. 
A sudden storm creates minor flooding, washing 
dozens of dead, bloated, diseased rats from the 
sewers. Terror over the plague rips through town. 
Marina fans the flames of panic, spreading ru-
mors that the characters or other rivals in town 
are responsible for the disease. 
EXAMPLE RIVAL: HIGH PRIEST CHELDAR 
The temple of Pholtus, god of the s un, seeks to bring 
as many folk as possible under its sway. Though it has 
been in town for only two years, the temple is already an 
influential force because of the determination and the 
brilliant oration of Cheldar, its high priest. 
Goals. Cheldar wants to ma ke the temple of Pholtus 
the most popular religion in town by bringing about 
peace and security for all. He believes keeping adventur-
ers in check or driving them out of town is an important 
step in that plan. 
Assets. The charismatic high priest has his oratory 
skill, divine spellcasting ability, and a few hundred com-
mon folk recently converted to the temple's cause. 
Plans. Cheldar is stern but fundamentally a good per-
son. He tries to win support by providing charity, pro-
moting peace, and working to enforce law and order. He 
is skeptical of the characters, however, convinced that 
they are troublemakers who will undermine the peace. 
He wants only officials of the town or the temple to be 
involved in handling any crises that arise. He strongly 
believes in his goals, yet he might still be made into an 
ally by good-hearted characters.

Description 
The grand festival of Pholtus fills the streets 
with somber worshipers, who maintain a day-
long torchlit vigil. They offer food, drink, and 
shelter to all in the temple of Pholtus. 
Cheldar, along with a small group of followers, 
appears in a tavern frequented by adventurers 
and seeks converts. A few NPC adventurers join 
his cause. 
In a public address in the town square, Cheldar 
rails against the forces of chaos, laying blame 
for recent troubles on adventurers who are med-
dling in things best left alone. 
The characters find that all adventurers in town 
receive an icy reception at best. 
Cheldar demands that the city levy enormous 
taxes on adventurers, claiming that they must 
pay their fair share to keep the city safe. 
DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES 
Downtime activities are tasks that usually take a work-
week (5 days) or longer to perform. T hese tasks can in-
clude buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, 
and working at a job. A character selects a downtime 
activity from a mong those available and pays the cost 
of that activity in time and money. You, as DM, then fol-
low the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the 
player of the results a nd any complications that ensue. 
Consider handling downtime away from the game 
table. For example, you could have the players pick their 
downtime activities at the end of a session, and then 
communicate about them by email or text, until you next 
see them in person. 
RESOLVING ACTIVITIES 
The description of each activity tells you how to resolve 
it. Many activities require an ability check, so be sure to 
note the character's relevant ability modifiers. Follow 
the steps in the activity, and determine the results. 
Most downtime activities require a workweek (5 days) 
to complete. Some activities require days, weeks (7 
days), or months (30 days). A character must spend at 
least 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activ-
ity for that day to count toward the activity's completion. 
The days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; 
you can spread them over a longer period of time than is 
required for the activity. But that period of time should 
be no more than twice as long as the required time; 
otherwise you should introduce extra complications (see 
below) and possibly double the activity's costs to repre-
sent the inefficiency of the character's progress. 
COMPLICATIONS 
The description of each activity includes a discussion 
of complications you can throw at the characters. The 
consequences of a complication might spawn entire 
adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give the 
characters headaches or advantages in any number of 
other ways.
