SWORN ENEMY 
Every ranger begins with a favored enemy (or two). The 
determination of a favored enemy might be tied to a 
specific event in the character's early life, or it might be 
entirely a matter of choice. 
What spurred your character to select a particular 
enemy? Was the choice made because of tradition or cu-
riosity, or do you have a grudge to settle? 
SWORN ENEMI ES 
d6 
Enemy 
You seek revenge on nature's behalf for the great 
transgressions your foe has committed. 
2 
Your forebears or predecessors fought these crea-
tures, and so shall you. 
3 
You bear no enmity toward your foe. You stalk such 
creatures as a hunter tracks down a wild animal. 
4 
You find your foe fascinating, and you collect books 
5 
6 
of tales and history concerning it. 
You collect tokens of your fallen enemies to remind 
you of each kill. 
You respect your chosen enemy, and you see your 
battles as a test of respective skills. 
RANGER ARCHETYPES 
At 3rd level, a ranger gains the Ranger Archetype fea-
ture. The following options are available to a ranger, 
in addition to those offered in the Player's Handbook: 
the Gloom Stalker, the Horizon Walker, and the Mon-
ster Slayer. 
GLOOM STALKER 
Gloom S talkers a re at borne in the darkest places: 
deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval 
forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk 
enter s uch places with trepidation, but a Gloom Stalker 
ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to a mbush 
threats before they can reach the broader world. Such 
ra ngers are often found in the Underdark, but they will 
go any place where evil lurks in the shadows.
