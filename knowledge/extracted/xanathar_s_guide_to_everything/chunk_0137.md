The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each crea-
ture in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn 
there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 
2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is diffi-
cult terrain. 
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on 
each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap 
from the center of the sphere toward one creature you 
choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell 
attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target

killed within the past 24 hours)

--- Page 168 ---

an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the 
demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when 
the spell ends. 
Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. 
When you summon it and on each of your turns thereaf-
ter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requfring no 
action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next 
turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attack-
ing any creature within reach that has attacked it. 
At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a 
Charisma saving throw. The demon has disadvantage 
on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed 
save, the demon continues to obey you. On a success-
ful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of 
the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing 
and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its 
ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it 
reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't 
disappear for ld6 rounds if it still has hit points. 
As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle 
on the ground with the blood used as a material com-
ponent. The circle is large enough to encompass your 
space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't 
cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone 
within it. Using the material component in this manner 
consumes it when the spell ends. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the challenge rating in-
creases by 1 for each slot level above 4th.

Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S , M (a vial of blood from a humanoid 
killed within the past 24 hours)

3-4 
Four demons of challenge rating 1/2 or lower 
5-6 
Eight demons of challenge rating 1/4 or lower 
The DM chooses the demons, such as manes or 
dretches, and you choose the unoccupied spaces you 
can see within range where they appear. A summoned 
demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when 
the spell ends. 
The demons are hostile to all creatures, including you. 
Roll initiative for the summoned demons as a group, 
which has its own turns. The demons pursue and attack 
the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability. 
As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle 
on the ground with the blood used as a material com-
ponent. The circle is large enough to encompass your 
space. While U1e spell lasts, the summoned demons 
can't cross the circle or harm it, and they can't target 
anyone within it. Using the material component in this 
manner consumes it when the spell ends.

spell slot of 6th or 7th level, you summon twice as many 
demons. If you cast it using a spell slot of 8th or 9th 
level, you summon three times as many demons. 
SYNAPTIC STATIC 
5th-level enchantment 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 
You choose a point within range and cause psychic en-
ergy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius 
sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence 
saving throw. A creature wiili an Intelligence score of 
2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes 
8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or ha lf as much 
damage on a successful one. 
After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 
1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts 
the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability 
checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to 
maintain concentration. The target can make an Intelli-
gence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, end-
ing the effect on itself on a success. 
TEMPLE OF THE GODS 
7th-level conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 hour 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a holy symbol worth at least 5 gp) 
Duration: 24 hours 
You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground 
you can see within range. The temple must fit within an 
unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. 
The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated 
to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented 
by the holy symbol used in the casting. 
You make all decisions about the temple's appear-
ance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a 
roof, with one door granting access to the interior and 
as many windows as you wish. Only you and any crea-
tures you designate when you cast the spell can open or 
close the door. 
The temple's interior is an open space with an idol 
or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is 
illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light 
or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air 
within, and the temperature is mild. 
The temple opposes types of creatures you choose 
when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the fol-
lowing: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a 
creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, 
that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On 
a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even 
if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there 
hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability 
check, or a saving throw inside ilie temple, it must roll a 
d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.
