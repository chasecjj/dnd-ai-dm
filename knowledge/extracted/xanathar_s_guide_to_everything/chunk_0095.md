defense or flee. The hidden pit is a classic example of 
this kind of trap. A 10-foot-deep pit usually deals little 
damage and is easy to escape, but it serves its purpose 
by impeding intruders. Other examples of delaying traps 
include collapsing wa lls, a portcullis that drops from the 
ceiling, and a locking mechanism that shuts and bars 
a door. If a delaying trap has moving parts that directly 
threaten characters when they operate, the cha racters 
a re usually required to make Dexterity saving throws to 
avoid ha rm. 
R estrain. A restra ining trap tries to keep its victims in 
place, leaving them unable to move. S uch traps are often 
employed in conjunction with regular guard patrols, so 
that victims are periodically extricated a nd taken away 
to be dealt with. But in an ancient dungeon, the guards 
might be long gone. 
Restra ining traps usually require a successful 
S trength saving throw to be avoided, but some don't 
allow saving throws. Io addition to dealing damage, a 
restraining trap a lso renders a creature unable to move. 
Making a subsequent successful S trength check (using 
the trap's saving throw DC) or dealing damage against 
the trap can break it a nd free the captive. Examples in-
clude a bear trap, a cage that drops from a ceiling, and a 
device that flings a net. 
S lay. Some traps are designed to eliminate intrud-
ers, plain and simple. Their effects include poisoned 
needles that s pring out when a lock is tampered with, 
blasts of fire that fill a room, poison gas, and other 
letha l measures. Saving throws-us ually Dexterity or 
Constitution- allow creatures to avoid or mitigate the 
trap's effects.

Before creating a trap's effects, think about its level and 
its lethality. 
Traps a re divided into four level ranges: 1-4, 5- 10, 
11- 16, and 17-20. The level you choose for a trap gives 
you a starting point for determining its potency. 
To further delineate the trap's strength, decide 
whether it is a moderate, dangerous, or deadly threat to 
cha racters in its level range. A moderate trap is unlikely 
to kill a cha racter. A dangerous trap typically deals 
enough damage that a character hit by one is eager for 
healing. A deadly trap might reduce a creature to 0 hit 
points in one shot, and leaves most creatures hit by it in 
need of a short or long rest. 
Consult the following tables when determining a 
trap's effects. The Trap Save DCs a nd Attack Bonuses 
table provides guidelines for a trap's saving throw DC, 
check DC, a nd attack bonus. The check DC is the default 
for any check used to interact with the trap. 
The Damage Severity by Level table lists the typical 
damage a trap deals at certain character levels. The 
damage values given assume that the trap damages one 
creature. Use d6s for damage in place of dlOs for traps 
that can a ffect more than one creature at a time. 
The S pell Equivalent by Level table shows the spell 
slot level that is appropriate for a given cha racter level 
a nd the severity of da nger posed by the trap. A s pell is a 
great foundation to use as the design of a trap, whether 
the trap duplicates the s pell (a mirror that casts charm 
person on whoever looks into it) or uses its effects (an 
alchemical device that explodes like a fir eball). 
The Deadly entry for characters of 17th level or higher 
suggests combining a 9th-level a nd a 5th-level spell into 
one effect. In this case, pick two s pells, or combine the 
effects of a s pell cast using a 9th-level and a 5th-level 
slot. For instance, a fir eball spell of this sort would deal 
24d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw.
