FIGHTER 
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE ALL DONE TALKING. 
-Tordek 
Of all the adventurers in the worlds of D&D, the fighter 
is perhaps the greatest paradox. On the one hand, a sin-
gular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their 
craft in quite the same way; their weapons, armor, and 
tactics differ across a vast spectrum. On the other hand, 
regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the 
heart of every fighter's motivation lies the same basic 
truth: it is better to wound than to be wounded. 
Although some adventuring fighters risk their lives 
fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily con-
cerned with the welfare of others. They put more value 
on the well-being of the society, the village, or the group 
than on their own safety. Even if there's gold in the off-
ing, the true reward for most fighters comes from send-
ing enemies to their doom. 
The sections below offer ways to add a little depth a nd 
a few personal touches to your fighter character. 
HERALDIC SIGN -------
Fighters typically do battle for a cause. Some fight on 
behalf of kingdoms besieged by monsters, while others 
quest only for personal glory. In either case, a fighter 
often displays a heraldic sign that represents that cause, 
either adopting the symbol of a nation or a royal line, or 
creating a crest to represent one's self-interest. 
Your character could be affiliated with an organization 
or a cause, and thus might already travel under a banner 
of some sort. If that's not the case, consider devising a 
heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature 
or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.

HERALDIC SIGNS 
d6 
Sign 
A rampant golden dragon on a green field, repre-
senting valor and a quest for wealth 
2 
The fist of a storm giant clutching lightning before 
a storm cloud, symbolizing wrath and power 
3 
Crossed greatswords in front of a castle gate, signi-
fying the defense of a city or kingdom 
4 
A skull with a dagger through it, representing the 
s 
doom you bring to your enemies 
A phoenix in a ring of fire, an expression of an in-
domitable spirit 
6 
Three drops of blood beneath a horizontal sword 
blade on a black background, symbolizing three 
foes you have sworn to kill 
INSTRUCTOR 
Some fighters are natural-born combatants who have 
a talent for surviving in battle. Others learned the ba-
sics of their combat prowess in their formative years 
from spending time in a military or some other martial 
organization, when they were taught by the leaders of 
the group. 
A third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those 
who received one-on-one instruction from an accom-
plished veteran of the craft. That instructor was, or 
perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat 
that relates to the student's background. 
If you decide that your character had an individual 
instructor, what is that person's specialty? Do you 
emulate your instructor in how you fight, or did you 
take the instructor's teachings and adapt them to your 
own purposes?
