CHAPTER 2 
DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS 
S THE DUNGEON M ASTER, YOU OVERSEE 
the game and weave together the story ex-
perienced by your players. You're the one 
who keeps it all going, and this chapter is 
for you. It gives you new rules options, as 
well as some refined tools for creating and 
running adventures and campaigns. It is a 
supplement to the tools and advice offered 
in the Dungeon Master's Guide. 
The chapter opens with optional rules meant to help 
you run certain parts of the game more smoothly. The 
chapter then goes into greater depth on several topics-
encounter building, random encounters, traps, magic 
items, and downtime-which largely relate to how you 
create and s tage your adventures. 
The material in this chapter is meant to make your 
life easier. Ignore anything you find here that doesn't 
help you, and don't hesitate to cus tomize the things that 
you do use. The game's rules exist to serve you and the 
games you run. As always, make them your own. 
SIMULTANEOUS EFFECTS 
Most effects in the game happen in s uccession, follow-
ing an order set by the rules or the DM. In rare cases, 
effects can happen at the same time, especiaUy at the 
start or end of a creature's turn. If two or more things 
happen at the same time on a character or monster's 
turn, the person at the game table-whether player or 
DM-who controls that creature decides the order in 
which those things happen. For example, if two effects 
occur at the end of a player character's turn, the player 
decides which of the two effects happens first. 
FALLING 
Falling from a great height is a significant risk for ad-
venturers and their foes. The rule given in the Player's 
Handbook is simple: at the end of a fall , you take ld6 
bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fell, to a maxi-
mum of 20d6. You also land prone, unless you somehow 
avoid taking damage from the fall. Here are two optional 
rules that expand on that s imple rule. 
RATE OF FALLING 
The rule for falling assumes that a creature immediately 
drops the entire distance when it falls. But what if a 
creature is at a high altitude when it falls, perhaps on 
the back of a griffon or on board an airs hip? Realisti-
cally, a fall from such a height can take more than a few 
seconds, extending past the end of the turn when the fall 
occurred. If you'd like high-altitude falls to be properly 
time-consuming, use the following optional rule. 
When you fall from a great height, you instantly de-
scend up to 500 feet. If you're still falling on your next 
turn, you descend up to 500 feet at the end of that turn. 
This process continues untiJ the fall ends, either be-
cause you hit the ground or the fall is otherwise halted. 
FLYING CREATURES AND FALLING 
A flying creature in flight falls if it is knocked prone, if 
its speed is reduced to 0 feet, or if it otherwise loses the 
ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being held 
aloft by magic, s uch as the fly spell. 
If you'd like a flying creature to have a better chance of 
s urviving a fall than a non-flying creature does, use this 
rule: s ubtract the creature's current flying speed from 
the distance it fell before calculating falling damage. 
T his rule is helpful to a flier that is knocked prone but 
is still conscious and has a current flying speed that is 
greater than 0 feet. T he rule is designed to sim ulate the 
creature flapping its wings furiously or taking s imilar 
measures to slow the velocity of its fall. 
If you use the rule for rate of falling in the previous 
section, a flying creature descends 500 feet on the turn 
when it falls, just as other creatures do. But if that crea-
ture starts any of its later turns s till falling and is prone, 
it can ha lt the fall on its turn by spending half its flying 
speed to counter the prone condition (as if it were stand-
ing up in midair). 
SLEEP 
Just as in the real world, D&D characters spend many 
hours s leeping, most often as part of a long rest. Most 
monsters also need to sleep. While a creature s leeps, 
it is s ubjected to the unconscious condition. Here are a 
few rules that expand on that basic fact. 
WAKING SOMEONE 
A creature that is naturally s leeping, as opposed to be-
ing in a magically or chemically induced sleep, wakes 
up if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an ac-
tion to shake or slap the creature awake. A sudden loud 
noise- such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell-also 
awakens someone that is sleeping naturaUy. 
Whispers don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's pas-
sive Wis dom (Perception) score is 20 or higher and the 
whispers are within 10 feet of the sleeper. Speech at a 
norma l volume awakens a sleeper if the environment 
is otherwise silent (no wind, birdsong, crickets, street 
sounds, or the like) and the sleeper has a passive Wis-
dom (Perception) score of 15 or higher. 
SLEEPING IN ARMOR 
Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the 
wearer, but sleeping in medium or heavy armor ma kes it 
difficult to recover fully during a long rest.
