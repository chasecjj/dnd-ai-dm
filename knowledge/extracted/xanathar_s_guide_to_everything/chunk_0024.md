FEROCIOUS CHARGER 
S ta rting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, 
whether you're mounted or not. U you move at least 10 
feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature 
a nd you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed 
on a S trength saving throw (DC 8 +your proficiency bo-
nus+ your S trength modifier) or be knocked prone. You 
can use this feature only once on each of your turns. 
V I GILANT D EFE NDE R 
Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with 
extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special 
reaction that you can ta ke once on every creature's turn, 
except your turn. You can use this specia l reaction only 
to make an opportunity attack, a nd you can't use it on 
the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: 
History, Insight, Performance, or P ersuasion. Alterna-
tively, you learn one la nguage of your choice. 
FIGHTING SPIRIT 
S tarting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield 
you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on your 
turn, you can give yourself advantage on weapon attack 
rolls until the end of the current tum. When you do so, 
you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of 
tempora ry hit points increases when you reach certa in 
levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 
at 15th level. 
You can use this feature three times, and you regain 
a ll expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. 
ELEGANT C O U RTIER 
S ta rting at 7th level, your discipline a nd attention to de-
tail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you 
ma ke a Charisma (Pers uasion) check, you gain a bonus 
to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier. 
Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency 
in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this pro-
ficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or 
Charisma saving throws (your choice). 
TIRE LESS SPIRIT 
Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and 
have no uses of Fighting S pirit rema ining, you re-
gain one use. 
R APID STRIKE 
Sta rting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for 
swift strikes. Tfyou take the Attack action on your turn 
and have advantage on an attack roll against one of 
the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to 
ma ke a n additiona l weapon attack against that target, 
as part of the same action. You can do so no more than 
once per turn. 
STRENGTH BEFORE D EATH 
Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the 
grasp of death. If you take da mage that reduces you to 
0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use 
your reaction to delay falling unconscious, a nd you can 
immediately take a n extra turn, interrupting the current 
turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, 
taking damage causes death saving throw failures as 
normal, and three death saving throw failures can still 
kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious 
if you still have 0 hit points. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finis h a long rest.
