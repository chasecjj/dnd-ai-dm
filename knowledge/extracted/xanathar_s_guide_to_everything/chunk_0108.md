C RIME 
S ometimes it pays to be bad. This activity gives a char-
acter the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk 
of arrest. 
Resources. A character must s pend one week and at 
least 25 gp gathering information on potential targets 
before committing the intended crime. 
Resolution. The character must make a series of 
checks, with the DC for all the checks chosen by the 
cha racter according to the amount of profit sought from 
the crime. 
The chosen DC can be 10, 15, 20, or 25. Successful 
completion of the crime yields a number of gold pieces, 
as s hown on the Loot Value table. 
To attempt a crime, the character makes three checks: 
Dexterity (Stealth), Dexterity using thieves' tools, and 
the player's choice of Intelligence (Investigation), Wis-
dom (Perception), or Cha risma (Deception). 
If none of the checks are successful, the cha racter is 
caught and jailed. The character must pay a fine equal to 
the profit the crime would have earned and must s pend 
one week in jail for each 25 gp of the fine. 
If only one check is successfu l, the heist fails but the 
character escapes. 
If two checks are s uccessful, the heist is a partial s uc-
cess, netting the character half the payout. 
If all three checks are successful, the character earns 
the full value of the loot.

Complications. A life of crime is filled with complica-
tions. Roll on the Crime Complications table (or create 
a complication of your own) if the character s ucceeds 
on only one check. If the character's rival is involved in 
crime or Jaw enforcement, a complication ens ues if the 
character s ucceeds on only two checks.

Resources. This activity requires one workweek of ef-
fort plus a stake of at least 10 gp, to a maximum of 1,000 
gp or more, as you see fit. 
R esolution. The cha racter must ma ke a series of

quality of the competition that the character runs into. 
Par t of the risk of gambling is that one never knows who 
might end up sitting across the table. 
The cha racter makes three checks: Wisdom (Insight), 
Cha risma (Deception), and Charisma (Intimidation). 
If the character has proficiency with a n appropriate 
gaming set, that tool proficiency can replace the rele-
vant ski ll in any of the checks. The DC for each of the 
checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a separate DC for each 
one. Cons ult the Gambling Results table to see how the

tions table.
