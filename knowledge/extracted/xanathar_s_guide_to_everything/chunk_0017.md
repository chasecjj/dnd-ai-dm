CIRCLE OF DREAMS 
Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail 
from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and 
its dreamlike realms. The druids' guardians hip of the 
natural world makes for a natural alliance between 
them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the 
world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds 
and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they 
protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and 
reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.

BALM OF THE SUMMER COURT 
At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of 
the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers 
respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy rep-
resented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level. 
As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you 
can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of 
those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the 
spent dice and add them together. The target regains a 
number of hit points equal to the total. The target also 
gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent. 
You regain all expended dice when you finish a 
Jong rest. 
HEARTH OF MOONLIGHT AND SHADOW 
At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a 
short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of 
the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the 
start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invis-
ible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered 
on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere. 
While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 
bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) 
checks, and any light from open Hames in the sphere (a 
campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it. 
The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you 
leave the sphere. 
HIDDEN PATHS 
Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical 
pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the 
blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can 
teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can 
see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport
