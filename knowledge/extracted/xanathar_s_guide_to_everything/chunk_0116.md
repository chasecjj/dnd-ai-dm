you can scribe an additional seven words and choose 
to make the message glow fai ntly, allowing it to be seen

hale a puff of smoke that takes the form of a single crea-
ture, such as a dragon, a Rumph, or a froghemoth. The

ferent command word and cause the rod to revert to a 
pole; however, the rod will elongate only as far as the 
surrounding space allows. 
POT OF AWAKENING 
Wondrous item, common 
If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot 
and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically trans-
forms into an awakened shrub (see the Monster Man-
ual for statistics) at the end of that time. W hen the shrub 
awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.

you must attach the ruby to the weapon by pressing the 
r uby against it for at least 10 minutes. Thereafter, the 
ruby can't be removed unless you detach it as ao action 
or the weapon is destroyed. Not even an antimagic field 
causes it to fall off. The ruby does fall off the weapon if 
your attunement to the r uby ends.
