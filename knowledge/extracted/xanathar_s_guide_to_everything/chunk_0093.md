MAKING TRAPS MEANIN G FUL 
If you want to improve the chance that the characters will 
come up against the traps you've set for them in an en-
counter or an adventure, it can be tempting to use a large 
number of traps. Doing so ensures that the characters will 
have to deal with at least one or two of them, but it's better 
to fight that urge. 
If your encounters or adventures are sown with too 
many traps, and if the characters are victimized over and 
over again as a result, they are likely to take steps to pre-
vent further bad things from happening. Because of their 
recent experience, the characters can become overly cau-
tious, and you run the risk of the action grinding to a halt 
as the players search every square inch of the dungeon for 
trip wires and pressure plates. 
Traps are most effective when their presence comes as a 
surprise, not when they appear so often that the characters 
spend all their effort watching out for the next one. 
EXAMPLE SIMPLE TRAPS 
The following simple traps can be used to populate your 
adventures or as models for your own creations. 
BEAR TRAP 
Simple trap (level 1- 4, dangerous threat) 
A bear trap resembles a set of iron jaws that springs 
shut when stepped on, clamping down on a creature's 
leg. The trap is spiked in the ground, leaving the victim 
immobilized. 
Trigger. A creature that steps on the bear trap 
triggers it. 
Effect. The trap makes an attack against the trigger-
ing creature. The attack has a +8 attack bonus and deals 
5 (ldlO) piercing damage on a hit. This attack can't gain 
advantage or disadvantage. A creature hit by the trap 
has its speed reduced to 0. It can't move until it breaks 
free of the trap, which requires a s uccessful DC 15 
Strength check by the creature or another creature adja-
cent to the trap. 
Countermeasures. A successful DC 10 Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals the trap. A s uccessful DC 10 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables it. 
CROSSBOW TRAP 
Simple trap (Jevel l -4, dangerous threat) 
The crossbow trap is a favorite of kobolds and other 
creatures that rely on traps to defend their lairs. It 
consists of a trip wire strung across a hallway and con-
nected to a pair of hidden heavy crossbows. The cross-
bows are aimed to fire down the hallway at anyone who 
disturbs the trip wire. 
Trigger. A creature that walks through the trip wire 
triggers the trap. 
Effect. The trap makes two attacks against the trig-
gering creature. Each attack has a +8 attack bonus and 
deals 5 (ldlO) piercing damage on a hit. This attack 
can't gain advantage or disadvantage. 
Countermeasures. A s uccessful DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals the trip wire. A successful 
DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the 
trip wire, and a check with a total of 5 or lower trig-
gers the trap. 
CHAPTER 2 I DUNGEON MASTER' S TOOLS 
FALLING PORTCULLIS 
Simple trap (Jevel 1- 4, moderate threat) 
Some folk who build dungeons, such as mad wizards 
in search of new victims, have no intention of allowing 
their visitors to make an easy escape. A falling portcullis 
trap can be especially devious ii it causes a portcullis 
to drop some distance away from the pressure plate 
that activates the trap. Although the trap is deep in the 
dungeon, the portcullis closes off the dungeon entrance, 
which is hundreds of feet away, meaning that adventur-
ers don't know they are trapped until they decide to head 
for the exit. 
Trigger. A creature that steps on the pressure plate 
triggers the trap. 
Effect. An iron portcullis drops from the ceiling, 
blocking an exit or a passageway. 
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check reveals the pressure plate. A successful 
DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables it, 
and a check with a total of 5 or lower triggers the trap. 
FIERY BLAST 
Simple trap (level 5- 10, dangerous threat) 
The temple of Pyremius, a god of fire, is threatened by 
thieves who seek to steal the fire opals displayed there 
by the priests in tribute to their god. A mosaic on the 
floor of the entryway to the inner sanctum delivers a 
fiery rebuke to intruders. 
Trigger. Anyone who steps on the mosaic causes fire 
to erupt from it. Those who openly wear holy symbols of 
Pyremius don't trigger this trap. 
Effect. A 15-foot cube of fire erupts, covering the pres-
sure plate and the area around it. Each creature in the 
area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
24 (7d6) fire damage on a failed save, or ha lf as much 
damage on a s uccessful one. 
Countermeasures. A successful DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals the presence of ash and faint 
burn marks in the area affected by this trap. A success-
ful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check enables a crea-
ture to destroy the trap by defacing a key rune on the 
perimeter of the mosaic that is within reach; failing this 
check causes the trap to activate. A successful dispel 
magic (DC 15) cast on the runes destroys the trap. 
NET TRAP 
Simple trap (level l-4, dangerous threat) 
Goblins, with their propensity to enslave their enemies, 
prefer traps that leave intruders intact so the victims can 
be put to work in the mines or elsewhere.
