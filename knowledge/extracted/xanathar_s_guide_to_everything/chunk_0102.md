DEFEATING COMPLEX TRAPS 
A complex trap is never defeated with a single check. In-
stead, each successful check foils some part of it or de-
grades its performance. Each element of the trap must 
be overcome individually to defeat the trap as a whole. 
As part of determining how your trap can be over-
come, look at your map and consider where the cha rac-
ters must be located to attempt an action that can foil 
part of the trap. As a rule, the characters should need to 
be near or adjacent to an element to have a chance of af-
fecting it. An element can be designed so that it protects 
itself. A fighter might be able to break a whirling blade, 
but moving close enough to attack it requires giving the 
blade a chance to strike. 
What methods are effective against your trap? Obvi-
ous candidates a re activities covered by the same sorts 
of checks used to defeat s imple traps, but use your 
knowledge of the trap's design to identify other options. 
A valve that leaks poison gas into a room can be stopped 
up. A statue that emits a deadly aura can be pushed over 
and smashed. Attacks, spells, and special abilities can 
all play a role in undermining a trap. 
Leave room for improvisation by the characters. Don't 
create a few predetermined solutions and wait for the 
players to figure out the right approach. If you under-
stand the mechanism behind how a trap works, that 
makes it much easier for you to respond to the players' 
ideas. If a character wants to try something you haven't 
allowed for, pick an ability, assess the chance of suc-
cess, and ask for a roll. 
Shutting down one part of a complex trap usually 
requires multiple successes. As a default, it takes three 
successful checks or actions to disable an element. The 
first successful check might reduce the element's saving 
throw DC or attack bonus. The second successful check 
might halve the element's damage, and the final suc-
cessful check shuts it down. 
For elements that don't attack, allow each successful 
check to reduce that element's effectiveness by one-
third. A lock's DC is decreased, or a gate opens wide 
enough to allow a Small character to squeeze through 
it. A mechanism pumping poison gas into the room be-
comes defective, causing the gas's damage to increase 
more s lowly or not at all. 
It takes time to disable a complex trap. Three charac-
ters can't make checks in rapid s uccession to disarm a 
complex trap in a matter of seconds. Each would get in

A complex trap is like a legendary monster in some ways. 
It has several tricks it can use on its turn, and it remains 
a threat throughout the round, not just on its turn. The 
trap's active elements are like a legendary creature's nor-
mal actions, and its constant elements are equivalent to 
legendary actions-except they are tied to specific areas in 
the trapped room. 
Although a legendary creature can move, improvise 
actions, and so forth, a trap is set to a specific script-an 
aspect that has the potential to make a complex trap stale 
and predictable. That's where dynamic elements come in. 
They keep the players on their toes and make dealing with 
a complex trap feel like a challenging, evolving situation. 
another character's way and disrupt the effort. Once a 
character succeeds on a check, another character can't 
attempt the same check against the same trap element 
until the end of the successful character's next turn. 
Not all of the characters' options need to be focused 
on stopping a trap from operating. Think of what charac-
ters can do to mitigate or avoid a trap's effects. Making 
the trap vulnerable to this sort of effort is a way to en-
gage characters who might be ill-suited to confront the 
trap directly. A successful Intelligence (Religion) check 
might provide insight into the imagery displayed by a 
trap in a temple or sh rine, giving other characters a clue 
about how and where to direct their effor ts. A character 
could stand in front of a dart trap while holding a s hield 
that the darts can target harmlessly, while other charac-
ters trigger that element as they work to disable it. 
DOWNTIME REVISITED 
It's possible for the cha racters to start a campaign at 1st 
level, dive into an epic story, a nd reach 10th level and 
beyond in a short amount of game time. Although that 
pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer 
a campa ign story with pauses built into it-times when 
adventurers are not going on adventures. T he downtime 
rules given in this section can be used as alternatives to 
the approach in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon 
Master's Guide, or you can use the material here to in-
spire the creation of your own options. 
By engaging the characters in downtime activities that 
take weeks or even months to complete, you can give 
your campaign a longer time line- one in which events 
in the world play out over years. Wars begin and end, ty-
rants come and go, and royal lines rise and fall over the 
course of the story that you and the characters tell. 
Downtime rules also provide ways for characters to 
spend-or be relieved of- the monetary treasure they 
amass on their adventures. 
The system presented here consists of two elements. 
First, it introduces the concept of rivals. Second, it de-
tails a number of downtime activities that characters 
can undertake. 
RIVALS 
Rivals are NPCs who oppose the characters and make 
their presence felt whenever the characters are engag-
ing in downtime. A rival might be a villain you have 
featured in past adventures or plan to use in the future. 
Rivals can also include good or neutral folk who are at 
odds with' the characters, whether because they have 
opposing goals or they simply dislike one another. The 
cultist of Orcus whose plans the characters have foiled, 
the ambitious merchant prince who wants to rule the 
city with an iron fist, and the nosy high priest of Helm 
who is convinced the cha racters are up to no good are 
all examples of rivals. 
A rival's agenda changes over time. Though the char-
acters engage in downtime only between adventures, 
their rivals rarely rest, continuing to spin plots and work 
against the characters even when the characters are off 
doing something else.
