LEFT TO RIGHT. B11Ros OF THE COLLEGES OF G1.11MOUR, SwoRDS, 11ND WHISPERS 
T he ways that a performance can go w rong are as 
varied as the fish in the sea. No matter what sort of 
disaster might occur, however, a bard has the courage 
and the confidence to rebound from it- either pressing 
on w ith the show (if possible) or promising to come back 
tomorrow w ith a new performance that's guaranteed 
to please. 
EMBARRASSMENTS 
d6 
Embarrassment 
The time when your comedic song, "Big Tom's 
Hijinks"-which, by the way, you thought was bril-
liant-did not go over well with Big Tom 
2 
The matinee performance when a circus's owlbear 
got loose and terrorized the crowd 
3 
When your opening song was your enthusiastic 
but universally hated rendition of "Song of the 
Froghemoth" 
4 
The first and last public performance of"Mirt, Man 
about Town" 
5 
The time on stage when your wig caught fire and 
you threw it down-which set fire to the stage 
6 
When you sat o n your lute by mistake during the 
final stanza of "Starlight Serenade" 
A BARD'S MUSE 
Naturally, every bard has a repertoire of songs and sto-
ries. Some bards are generalists w ho can draw from 
a wide range of topics for each performance, and w ho 
take pride in their versatility. Others adopt a more per-
sonal approach to their art, driven by their attachment to 
a muse- a particular concept that inspires much of what 
those bards do in front of an audience. 
A bard who follows a muse generally does so to gain a 
deeper understanding of w hat that muse represents and 
how to best convey that understanding to others through 
per formance. 
If your bard character has a m use, it could be one of 
the three described here, or one of your own devising. 
Nature. You feel a kinship w ith the natural world, and 
its beauty and mystery inspire you. For you, a tree is 
deeply symbolic, its roots delving into the dark unknown 
to draw forth the power of the earth, while its branches 
reach toward the sun to nourish their flowers and 
fruit. Nature is the ancient witness who has seen every 
kingdom rise and fall, even those whose names have 
been forgotten and wait to be rediscovered. The gods of 
nature share their secrets with druids and sages, open-
ing their hearts and minds to new ways of seeing, and 
as with those individuals, you find that your creativity 
blossoms while you wander in an open field of waving 
grass or walk i~ silent reverence through a grove of an-
cient oaks. 
Love. You are on a quest to identify the essence of 
true love. Though you do not disdain the superficial 
love of flesh and form, the deeper form of love that can 
inspire thousands or bring joy to one's every moment 
is what you are interested in. Love of this sort takes on 
many forms, and you can see its presence everyw here-
from the sparkling of a beautiful gem to the song of a 
simple fisher thanking the sea for its bounty. You are 
on the trail of love, that most precious and mysterious 
of emotions, and your search fills your stories and your 
songs with vitality and passion.
