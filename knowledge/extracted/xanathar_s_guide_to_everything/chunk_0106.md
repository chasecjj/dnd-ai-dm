Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the 
workweek and access to the local nobility. 
A character with the noble background can mingle 
with the upper class, but other characters can do so only 
if you judge that the cha racter has made sufficient con-
tacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit 
and the Deception skill to pass as a noble visiting from a 
distant city. 
Resolution. After a workweek of carousing, a charac-
ter stands to make contacts within the selected social 
class. The character makes a Charisma (Pers uasion)

Character has made two all ied contacts. 
Character has made three allied contacts. 
Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the 
character. Each one either owes the character a favor 
or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact 
works against the character, placing obstacles but stop-
ping s hort of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied 
contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, 
but not at the ris k of their lives. 
Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, 
mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who 
normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town. 
Middle-class contacts include guild members, spell-
casters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-
kept establishments. 
Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal 
servants. Carousing with s uch folk covers formal ban-
quets, state dinners, and the like. 
Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, 
the character needs to carouse again to get back into the 
NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not 
help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can in-
fluence roleplaying and how the characters interact with 
them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help. 
You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might 
decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and 
a guard stationed at the western gate are the charac-
ter's a llied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the 
players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life 
and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care 
about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track 
and might render a contact useless if that character 
doesn't come into play. 
Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an 
NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When 
the characters are in the area in which they caroused, 
a player can expend an allied contact and designate 
an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is 
of the correct social class based on how the character

caroused. The player should provide a reasonable expla-
nation for this relationship and work it into the game. 
Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, 
since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts 
while giving players the freedom to ensure that the con-
tacts they accumulate are useful. 
The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You 
can give the characters a specific NPC they should 
avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or 
dramatic moment. 
At any time, a character can have a maximum number 
of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 +the character's 
Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, na med 
contacts don't count toward this limit- only ones that 
can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact. 
Complications. Characters who carouse risk bar 
brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and 
building a bad reputation around town. As a rule of 
thumb, a character has a 10 percent chance of triggering 
a complication for each workweek of carousing.

CRAFTING AN ITEM 
A character who has the time, the money, a nd the 
needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, 
clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear. 
Resources and Resolution. In addition to the appro-
priate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs 
raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost. To 
determine how many workweeks it takes to create an 
item, divide its gold piece cost by SO. A cha racter can 
complete multiple items in a workweek if the items' com-
bined cost is SO gp or lower. Items that cost more than 
SO gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as 
long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location. 
Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide 
the time needed to create an item by the number of char-
acters working on it. Use your judgment when determin-
ing how many characters can collaborate on an item. A 
particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one 
or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might 
allow four or more workers. 
A character needs to be proficient with the tools 
needed to craft an item a nd have access to the appro-
priate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to 
have the appropriate tool proficiency. You need to make 
a ny judgment calls regarding whether a character has 
the correct equipment. The following table provides 
some examples. 
Proficiency 
Herbalism kit 
Leatherworker's tools 
Smith's tools 
Weaver's tools 
Items 
Antitoxin, potion of healing 
Leather armor, boots 
Armor, weapons 
Cloaks, robes 
If all the above requirements are met, the result of the 
process is an item of the desired sort. A character can 
sell a n item crafted in this way at its listed price. 
Crafting Magic Items. Creating a magic item requires 
more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-
term process that involves one or more adventures to 
track down rare materials and the lore needed to cre-
ate the item.
