Potions of healing and spell scroJ/s a re exceptions to 
the following rules. For more information, see "Brewing 
Potions of Healing" later in this section and the "Scrib-
ing a Spell S croll" section, below. 
To start with, a character needs a formula for a magic 
item in order to create it. The formula is like a recipe. 
It lis ts the materia ls needed and steps required to 
make the item. 
An item invariably requires an exotic material to com-
plete it. This materia l can range from the skin of a yeti to 
a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental 
P lane of Water. Finding that material should take place 
as part of an adventure. 
The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the chal-
lenge rating of a creature that the characters need to 
face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that fac-
ing a creature does not necessarily mean that the char-
acters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the 
creature might gua rd a location or a resource that the 
characters need access to.

If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a 
thematic fit for the item to be crafted. For example, cre-
ating mariner's armor might require the essence of a 
water weird. Crafting a staff of charming might require 
the cooperation of a specific arcanaloth, who will help 
only if the characters complete a task for it. Making a 
staff of power might hinge on acquiring a piece of a n 
ancient stone that was once touched by the god of mag-
ic- a stone now guarded by a suspicious androsphinx. 
l n addition to facing a specific creature, creating an 
item comes with a gold piece cost covering other mate-
rials, tools, and so on, based on the item's rarity. Those 
values, as well as the time a character needs to work in 
order to complete the item, are s hown on the Magic Item 
Crafting Time and Cost table. Halve the .listed price and 
creation time for any consumable items.

To complete a magic item, a character also needs 
whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a 
nonmagical object, or proficiency in the Arcana skill. 
If all the above requirements are met, the result of the 
process is a magic item of the desired sort. 
Complications. Most of the complications involved in 
creating something, especially a magic item, a re linked 
to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or compo-
nents needed to complete the work. The complications 
a character might face as byproducts of the creation 
process are most interesting when the characters are 
working on a magic item: there's a 10 percent chance for 
every five workweeks spent on crafting an item that a 
complication occurs. The Crafting Complications table 
provides examples of what might happen.
