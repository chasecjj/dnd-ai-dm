a +5 bonus to the attack roU and dealing 11 (2dl0) 
slashing damage on a hit. 
Crushing Pillars (Initiative 10). Each creature in the 
SO-foot-long area beyond the first 80 feet of the hall-
way mus t make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On 
a failed save, a creature takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning 
damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, 
the creature takes half as much damage and is n't 
knocked prone. 
Rune of Fear (Initiative 10). Each creature in the 
30-foot-long a rea beyond the Crushing Pillars mus t 
make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a fa iled 
saving throw, the creature becomes frightened by 
the rune, and it must immediately use its reaction 
to move its s peed in the direction of the pillars. The 
frightened creature can't move closer to the far end 
of the hallway until it uses its action to make a DC 
15 Wis dom saving throw, which ends the frightened 
condition on itself on a s uccess. 
Dynamic Elements. The blades and the rune become 
more da ngerous the longer the trap remains active. 
Blades Accelerate. The blades move with increasing 
s peed, slowing only when they hit a target. Each 
time the blades miss with an attack, their next at-
tack becomes harder to avoid. After each miss, the 
blades' attack bonus increases by 2, and their dam-
age increases by 3 (ld6). These benefits apply until 
the blades hit a target, after which the values return 
to normal. 
Rune's Defense. Tampering with the Rune of Fear in-
creases the trap's power. Each successful check on 
an attempt to disable the rune increases the damage 
of the blades a nd the crushing pillars by 5 (ldlO) 
and increases the rune's saving throw DC by 1. 
Constant Elements. The Whirling Blades and the 
Rune of Fear affect each creature that ends its turn in 
an area affected by these elements. 
Whirling Blades. Any creature that ends its turn in 
the blades' area is targeted by an attack: +5 attack 
bonus; 5 (ldlO) slashing damage on a hit. 
Rune of Fear. Any creature that ends its turn within 
30 feet of the far end of the corridor must ma ke a 
saving throw agains t the Rune of Fear effect. 
Countermeasures. Each of the trap's active elements 
can be thwarted by particular countermeasures. 
Whirling Blades. Characters can smash the blades, 
damage their components, or discern how to 
avoid them. The blades are disabled if their attack 
bonus is reduced to -8. Ways to reduce it are de-
scribed below. 
Intelligence (In vestigation), DC 15. As an action, a 
creature that can see the blades can attempt an In-
telligence (Investigation) check. A successful check 
means that the character bas learned how to antici-
pate the blades' movement, imposing disadvantage 
on the blades' attacks against the creature while it 
is n't incapacitated. 
Attack. A creature in the area can ready an attack to 
s trike at one of the blades as it goes by. The blade 
gains advantage on its attack against the creature. 
The creature then attacks. Each blade has AC 15 
and 15 hit points. Destroying a blade reduces the 
Whirling Blades attack bonus by 2. 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools, DC 15. Creatures 
can use thieves' tools in the area attacked by the 
blades to foil their mecha nis m. A successful check 
reduces the Whirling Blades attack bonus by 2. 
Crushing Pillars. The pillars are not susceptible to 
countermeasures. 
Rune of Fear. T he rune can be disabled with three 
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) checks. 
Each check requires an action. A creature must be 
at the end of the hallway to attempt the check, and 
only one creature can work on this task at once. 
Once a creature attempts a check for this purpose, 
no other cha racter can do so until the end of that 
creature's next turn. Alternatively, the rune can be 
disabled with three successful castings of dispel 
magic (DC 13) targeting the rune. 
SPHERE OF CRUSHING D OOM 
Complex.trap (level 5- 10, deadly threat) 
The court jester devised a deadly trap to foil anyone who 
sought to steal his magic fool's cap. The jester's tomb 
is located at the end of a 10-foot-wide, 150-foot-long 
hallway that descends sharply from north to south. The 
entrance to the tomb is a door on the eastern wall at the 
bottom of the s lope, at the south end of the hall. 
Trigger. This trap activates as soon as the door lead-
ing to the jester's coffin is opened. A magic portal opens 
at the northern end of the ha! I way and disgorges a n 
enormous steel s phere, which hurtles down the s lope. 
When it reaches the bottom of the slope, a second portal
