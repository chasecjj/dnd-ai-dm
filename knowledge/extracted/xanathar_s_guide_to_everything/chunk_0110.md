You earn one favor. 
You earn two favors. 
A favor, in broad terms, is a promise of future assis-
tance from a representative of the temple. It can be 
expended to ask the temple for help in dealing with a 
s pecific problem, for general political or socia l support, 
or to reduce the cost of cleric spellcasting by 50 percent. 
A favor could also take the form of a deity's intervention, 
s uch as an omen, a vision, or a minor miracle provided 
at a key moment. This latte r sort of favor is expended by 
the DM, who a lso determines its nature. 
Favors earned need not be expended immediately, but 
only a certain number can be stored up. A character can 
have a maximum number of unused favors equal to 1 + 
the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of one un-
used favor). 
Complications. Temples can be labyrinths of political 
and social scheming. Even the best-intentioned sect can 
fall prone to rivalries. A character who serves a temple 
risks becoming embroiled in such struggles. Every

RESEARCH 
Forewarned is forearmed. The research downtime ac-
tivity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a 
monster, a location, a magic item, or some other partic-
ular topic. 
Resources. Typically, a character needs access to a 
library or a sage to conduct research. Assuming such 
access is available, conducting research requires one 
workweek of effort and at least 50 gp spent on materials, 
bribes, gifts, and other expenses. 
Resolution. The character declares the focus of the 
research-a specific person, place, or thing. After one 
workweek, the character makes an Intelligence check 
with a +1 bonus per 100 gp s pent beyond the initial 
100 gp, to a maximum of +6. In addition, a character 
who has access to a particularly well-stocked library 
or knowledgeable sages gains advantage on this check.

Outcome 
No effect. 
You learn one piece of lore. 
You learn two pieces of lore. 
You learn three pieces of lore. 
Each piece of lore is the equivalent of one true state-
ment about a person, place, or thing. Examples include 
knowledge of a creature's resistances, the password 
needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells com-
monly prepared by an order of wizards, a nd so on. 
As DM, you are the fina l arbiter concerning exactly 
what a character learns. For a monster or an NPC, you 
can reveal elements of statistics or personality. For a lo-
cation, you can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden 
entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a crea-
ture that guards the place. 
Complications. The greatest risk in research is un-
covering false information. Not all lore is accurate or
