HUNTER'S SENSE 
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to peer at a creature 
and magically discern how best to hurt it. As an action, 
choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. 
You immediately learn whether the creature has any 
damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and 
what they a re. If the creature is hidden from divination 
magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, re-
sistances, or vulnerabilities. 
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 
your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all 
expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. 
SLAYER'S P REY 
Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, 
increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, 
you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of 
you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn 
that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an 
extra 1d6 damage from the weapon. 
This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It 
ends early if you designate a different creature. 
SUPERNATURAL DEFENSE 
At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey's 
assaults on your mind a nd body. Whenever the target 
of your Slayer's Prey forces you to make a saving throw 
and whenever you make an ability check to escape that 
ta rget's grapple, add 1d6 to your roll. 
MAGIC-USER'S NEMESIS 
At 11th level, you gain the ability to thwart someone 
else's magic. ~hen you see a creature casting a spell or 
teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use your reac-
tion to try to magically foil it. The creature must succeed 
on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, 
or its s pell or teleport fails and is wasted. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest. 
SLAYER'S COUNTER 
At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when 
your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slay-
er's Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use 
your reaction to make one weapon attack against the 
quarry. You make this attack immediately before making 
the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automati-
cally s ucceeds, in addition to the attack's normal effects.
