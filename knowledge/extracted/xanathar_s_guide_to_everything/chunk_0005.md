Both of these attitudes can give rise to supersti-
tions. These beliefs are often passed down within a 
family or shared among the members of a clan or a 
hunting group. 
If your barbarian character has any superstitions, 
were they ingrained in you by your family, or are they 
the result of personal experience?

Superstition 
If you disturb the bones of the dead, you inherit all 
the troubles that plagued them in life. 
Never trust a wizard. They're all devils in disguise, 
especially the friendly ones. 
Dwarves have lost t heir spirits, and are almost like 
the undead. That's why they live underground. 
Magical things bring trouble. Never sleep with a 
magic object within ten feet of you. 
When you walk through a graveyard, be sure to 
wear silver, or a ghost might jump into your body. 
If an elf looks you in the eyes, she's trying to read 
your thoughts. 
PRIMAL PATHS 
At 3rd level, a barbarian gains the Primal Path feature. 
The following options are available to a barbarian, in 
addition to those offered in the Player's Handbook: the 
Path of the Ancestral Guardian, the Path of the Storm 
Herald, and the Path of the Zealot.

PATH OF THE ANCESTRAL GUARDIAN 
Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their an-
cestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past 
linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and 
protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this 
path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and 
calls on these guardian s pirits for aid. 
Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians 
can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In 
order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, bar-
barians who follow this path cover themselves in elabo-
rate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These 
tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters 
and other fearsome rivals.

ANCESTRAL PROTECTORS 
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral 
warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you're 
raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your 
turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder 
its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target 
has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against 
you, and when the target hits a creature other than you 
with an attack, that creature has resistance to the da m-
age dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends 
early if your rage ends. 
SPIRIT SHIELD 
Beginning at 6th level, the guardia n spirits that aid you 
can provide supernatural protection to those you de-
fend. If you are raging and a nother creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your 
reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6. 
When you reach certain levels in this class, you can 
reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 
4d6 at 14th level. 
CONSULT THE SPIRITS 
At 10th level, you gain the ability to cons ult with your 
ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury or 
clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material 
components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, 
this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your 
ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for these spells. 
After you cast either spell in thjs way, you can't use 
this feature again until you finish a short or long rest. 
VENGEFUL ANCESTORS 
At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful 
enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to 
reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an 
amount of force damage equal to the damage that your 
Spirit Shield prevents. 
PATH OF THE STORM HERALD 
All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants 
them s uperior strength, durability, and speed. Barba r-
ians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn 
to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, 
which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbaria n 
of this path taps into the forces of nature to create pow-
erful magical effects. 
Storm heralds a re typically elite champions who train 
alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect 
nature. Other storm heralds hone their cra ft in lodges in 
regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the 
world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

STORM AURA 
Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical 
aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you 
in every direction, but not through total cover. 
Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter 
your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each 
of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or 
tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen envi-
ronment, as d~ta iled below. You can change your envi-
ronment choice whenever you gain a level in this class. 
If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC 
equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitu-
tion modifier. 
Desert. When this effect is activated, all other crea-
tures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage 
increases when you reach certain levels in this class, in-
creasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, 
and 6 at 20th level. 
Sea. When this effect is activated, you can choose one 
other creature you can see in your aura. The target must 
make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes l d6 
lightning da mage on a failed save, or half as much dam-
age on a successful one. The damage increases when 
you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 
at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level. 
Tundra. When this effect is activated, each creature of 
your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as 
icy spirits inure it to s uffering. The temporary hit points 
increase when you reach certa in levels in this class, in-
creasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, 
and 6 at 20th level. 
STORM SOUL 
At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when 
your aura isn't active. The benefits are based on the en-
vironment you chose for your Storm Aura. 
Desert. You gain resistance to fire damage, and you 
don't s uffer the effects of extreme heat, as described in 
the Dungeon Master's Guide. Moreover, as an action, 
you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn 
or carried by anyone else and set it on fire. 
Sea. You gain resistance to lightning damage, and 
you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming 
s peed of 30 feet. 
Tundra. You gain resistance to cold damage, and you 
don't suffer the effects of extreme cold, as described in 
the Dungeon Master's Guide. Moreover, as an action, 
you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, 
which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature 
is in the cube. 
SHIELDING STORM 
At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm 
to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the 
damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul fea-
ture while the creature is in your Storm Aura.
