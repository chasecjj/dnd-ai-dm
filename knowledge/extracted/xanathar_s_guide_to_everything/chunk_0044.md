gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends 
to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no 
matter the weapon's type. 
ACCURSED SPECTER 
Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person 
you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When 
you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from 
its corpse as a specter, the statistics for which are in 
the Monster Manual. When the specter appears, it gains 
temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. 
Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. 
It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special 
bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier 
(minimum of +O). 
The specter remains in your service until the end of 
your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the 
afterlife. 
Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't 
use the feature again until you finish a long rest. 
ARMOR OF HEXES 
At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the tar-
get cursed by your Hexblade's Curse bits you with an 
attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 
4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless 
of its roll. 
MASTER OF HEXES 
Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's 
Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When

you can apply the curse to a different creature you can 
see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't inca-
pacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you 
don't regain hit points from the death of the previously 
cursed creature. 
ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS 
At 2nd level, a warlock gains the Eldritch Invocations 
feature. Here are new options for that feature, in addi-
tion to the options in the Player's Handbook. 
If an eldritch invocation has a prerequisite, you must 
meet it to learn the invocation. You can learn the invo-
cation at the same time that you meet its prerequisite. A 
level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. 
ASPECT OF THE MOON

by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you

CLOAK OF FLIES 
Prerequisite: 5th level 
As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a 
magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura ex-
tends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through 
total cover. It lasts until you're incapacitated or you dis-
miss it as a bonus action. 
The aura grants you advantage on Charisma (Intimi-
dation) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma 
checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the 
aura takes poison damage equal to your Charisma mod-
ifier (minimum of 0 damage). 
Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again 
until you finish a short or long rest.
