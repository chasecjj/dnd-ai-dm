CHAPTER 3 
SPELLS 
ANY OF THE CHARACTER CLASSES IN THE 
Player's Handbook harness magic in the 
form of spells. This chapter provides new 
spells for those classes, as well as for 
spellcasting monsters. The Dungeon Mas-
ter decides which of these spells are avail-
able in a campaign and how they can be 
learned. For example, a DM might decide 
that some of the spells are freely available, that others 
are unobtainable, and that a handful can be found only 
after a special quest, perhaps discovered in a long-lost 
tome of magic. Wizard spells, in particular, can be intro-
duced to a campaign in spellbooks found as treasure. 
When a DM adds spells to a campaign, clerics, druids, 
and paladins require special consideration. When char-
acters of those classes prepare their spells, they have ac-
cess to the entire spell list for their class. Given that fact, 
the DM should be cautious about making all of these 
new spells available to a player who is overwhelmed 
when presented with many options. For such a player, 
consider adding only story-appropriate spells to the spell 
list of that player's character. 
SPELL LISTS 
The following spell lists show which spells can be cast 
by characters of each class. Aspell's school of magic is 
noted in parentheses. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, 
the ritual tag also appears in the parentheses.
