I became a paladin because ... 
A fantastical being appeared before me and called 
on me to undertake a holy quest. 
One of my ancestors left a holy quest unfulfilled, 
so I intend to finish that work. 
The world is a dark and terrible place. I decided to 
serve as a beacon oflight shining out against the 
gathering shadows. 
I served as a paladin's squ ire, learn ing all I needed 
to swear my own sacred oath. 
Evil must be opposed on all fronts. I feel com-
pelled to seek out wickedness and purge it from 
the world. 
Becoming a paladin was a natural consequence of 
my unwavering faith. In taking my vows, I became 
the holy sword of my religion. 
I became a ranger because ... 
I found purpose while I honed my hunting skills by 
bringing down dangerous animals at the edge of 
civilization. 
I always had a way with animals, able to calm them 
with a soothing word and a touch. 
I suffer from terrible wanderlust, so being a ranger 
gave me a reason not to remain in one place for 
too long. 
4 
I have seen what happens when the monsters 
come out from the dark. I took it upon myself to 
become the first line of defense against the evils 
that lie beyond civilization's borders. 
5 
I met a grizzled ranger who taught me woodcraft 
and the secrets of the wild lands. 
6 
I served in an army, learning the precepts of my 
professio n while blazing trails and scouting enemy 
encampments.

I became a rogue because ... 
I've always been nimble and quick of wit, so I de-
cided to use those talents to help me make my way 
in the world. 
An assassin or a thief wronged me, so I focused 
my training on mastering the skills of my enemy to 
better combat foes of that sort. 
An experienced rogue saw something in me and 
taught me several useful t ricks. 
I decided to turn my natural lucky streak into the 
basis of a career, though I still realize that improv-
ing my skills is essential. 
I took up with a group of ruffians who showed m e 
how to get what I want through sneakiness rather 
than direct confrontation. 
I'm a sucker fo r a shiny bauble or a sack of coins, 
as long as I can get my hands on it without risking 
life and limb. 
SORCERER 
d6 
I became a sorcerer because ... 
When I was born, all the water in the house froze 
solid, the milk spoiled, or all the iron turned to cop-
per. My family is convinced that this event was a 
harbinger of stranger things to come for me. 
2 
I suffered a terrible emotional or physical strain, 
which brought forth my latent magical power. I 
have fought to control it ever since. 
3 
My immediate family never spoke of my ancestors, 
and when I asked, they would change the subject. 
It wasn't until I started displaying strange talents 
that the full truth of my heritage came out. 
4 
When a monster threatened one of my friends, I 
became filled with anxiety. I lashed out instinctively 
and blasted the wretched thing with a force that 
came from within me. 
5 
Sensing something special in me, a stranger taught 
me how to control my gift. 
6 
After I escaped from a magical conAagration, I 
realized that though I was unharmed, I was not 
unchanged. I began to exhibit unusual abilities that 
I am just beginning to understand. 
WARLOCK 
d6 
I became a warlock because ... 
While wandering around in a forbidden place, I 
encountered an otherworldly being that offered to 
enter into a pact with me. 
2 
I was examining a strange tome I found in an aban-
doned library when the entity that would become 
my patron suddenly appeared before me.
