R OGUE 
P EOPLE FORGET THAT T H E ENTIRE POI NT OF VENTU RI NG 
down into a dusty tomb is to bring back the prizes hidden 
away there. Fighting isforfools. Dead men can't spend 
their fortunes. 
- Barnabas Bladecutter 
When brute force won't get the job done, or when magic 
isn't available or appropriate, the rogue rises to the 
fore. With skills tied to stealth, subterfuge, and trickery, 
rogues can get into and out of trouble in ways that few 
other characters can emulate. 
Some rogues who turn to adventuring are former 
criminals who have decided that dodging monsters 
is preferable to remaining one step ahead of the law. 
Others are professional killers in search of a profitable 
application of their talents between contracts. Some 
simply love the thrill of overcoming any challenge that 
stands in their way. 
On adventures, a rogue is likely to mix a n outwardly 
cautious approach- few rogues enjoy combat- with a 
ravenous hunger for loot. Most of the time, in a rogue's 
mind, taking up arms against a creature is not about 
killing the creature but about becoming the new owner 
of its treasure. 
The following sections explore certain facets of what it 
means to be a rogue, which you can use to add depth to 
your character. 
GUILTY PLEASURE 
Most of what rogues do revolves around obtaining trea-
sure and preventing others from doing the same. Little 
gets in the way of attaining those goals, except that 
many rogues are enticed away from that path by a com-
pulsion that clouds their thinking-an irresistible need 
that must be satisfied, even if doing so is risky. 
A rogue's guilty pleasure could be the acquisition 
of a physical item, something to be experienced, or a 
way of conducting oneself at certain times. One rogue 
might not be able to pass up any loot made of silver, for 
instance, even if said loot is hanging around the neck 
of a castle guard. Another one can't go through a day 
in the city without lifting a purse or two, just to keep 
in practice. 
CHAPTER 1 I CHARACTER OPTIONS 
What's the one form of temptation that your rogue 
cha racter can't resist when the opportunity presents it-
self, even if giving into it might mean trouble for you and 
your companions?

ADVERSARY 
Naturally, those who enforce the law a re bound to come 
up against those who break it, and it's the rare rogue 
who isn't featured on at least one wa nted poster. Beyond 
that, it's in the nature of their profession that rogues 
often come into contact with criminal elements, whether 
out of choice or necessity. Some of those people can be 
adversaries too, and they're likely to be harder to deaJ 
with than the average member of the city watch. 
If your character's backstory doesn't already include a 
personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to 
come up with a reason why an adversary has appeared 
in your life. Perhaps you've been the subject of scrutiny 
for a while from someone who wants to use you for 
nefarious purposes a nd has just now become known to 
you. S uch an incident could be the basis for an upcom-
ing adventure. 
Does your rogue character have an adversary who 
also happens to be a criminal? If so, how is this relation-
ship affecting your life?
