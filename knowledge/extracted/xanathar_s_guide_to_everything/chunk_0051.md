CRIMINAL 
d6 
I became a criminal because ... 
I resented authority in my younger days and saw a 
life of crime as the best way to fight against tyranny 
and oppression. 
2 
Necessity forced me to take up the life, since it was 
the only way I could survive. 
3 
I fell in with a gang of reprobates and ne'er-do-
wells, and I learned my specialty from them.

A parent or relative taught me my criminal spe-
cialty to prepare me for the family business. 
I left home and found a place in a thieves' gu ild or 
some other criminal organization. 
I was always bored, so I turned to crime to pass the 
time and discovered I was quite good at it.

I became a n e ntertainer because ... 
Members of my family made ends meet by per-
forming, so it was fitting for me to follow their 
example. 
I always had a keen insight into other people, 
enough so that I could make them laugh or cry 
with my stories or songs. 
I ran away from home to follow a minstrel troupe. 
I saw a bard perform once, and I knew from that 
moment on what I was born to do. 
I earned coin by performing on street corners and 
eventually made a name for myself. 
A traveling entertainer took me in and taught me 
the trade. 
FOLK HERO 
d6 
I became a folk hero because ... 
I learned what was right and wrong from my family. 
2 
I was always enamored by tales of heroes and 
wished I could be something more than ordinary. 
3 
I hated my mundane life, so when it was time for 
someone to step up and do the right thing, I took 
my chance. 
4 
A parent or one of my relatives was an adventurer, 
and I was inspired by that person's courage. 
5 
A mad old hermit spoke a prophecy when I was 
born, saying that I would accomplish great things. 
6 
I have always stood up for those who are weaker 
than I am. 
GUILD ARTISAN 
d6 
I became a guild artisan because ... 
2 
I was apprenticed to a master who taught me the 
guild's business. 
I helped a guild artisan keep a secret or complete a 
task, and in return I was taken on as an apprentice.

I became a guild artisan because ... 
One of my family members who belonged to the 
guild made a place for me. 
I was always good with my hands, so I took the op-
portunity to learn a trade. 
I wanted to get away from my home situation and 
start a new life. 
I learned the essentials of my craft from a mentor 
but had to join the guild to finish my training. 
HERMIT

I became a hermit because ... 
My enemies ruined my reputation, and I fled to the 
wilds to avoid further disparagement.

inner peace.

I never liked the people I called my friends, so it 
was easy for me to strike out on my own. 
I felt compelled to forsake my past, but did so with 
great reluctance, and sometimes I regret making 
that decision. 
I lost everything-my home, my family, my friends. 
Going it alone was all I could do. 
Society's decadence disgusted me, so I decided to 
leave it behind. 
I became a noble because ... 
I come from an old and storied fam ily, and it fell to 
me to preserve the family name. 
My family has been disgraced, and I intend to clear 
our name. 
My family recently came by its title, and that eleva-
tion thrust us into a new and strange world. 
My family has a title, but none of my ancestors 
have distinguished themselves since we gained it. 
My family is filled with remarkable people. I hope 
to live up to their example. 
I hope to increase my family's power and influence. 
OUTLANDER 
d6 
I be.came an outlander because ... 
I spent a lot of time in the wilderness as a young-
ster, and I came to love that way of life. 
2 
From a young age, I couldn't abide the stink of the 
cities and preferred to spend my time in nature. 
3 
I came to understand the darkness that lurks in the 
wilds, and I vowed to combat it. 
4 
My people lived on the edges of civilization, and I 
learned the methods of survival from my family. 
5 
6 
After a tragedy I retreated to the wilderness, leav-
ing my old life behind. 
My family moved away from civilization, and I 
learned to adapt to my new environment.
