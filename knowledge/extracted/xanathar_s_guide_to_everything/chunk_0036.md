BENEFACTOR 
Few rogues make it far in life before needing someone's 
help, which means thereafter owing that benefactor a 
significant debt. 
If your character's backstory doesn't already include a 
personage of this sort, you could work with your OM to 
determine why a benefactor has appeared in your life. 
Perhaps you benefited from something your benefactor 
did for you without realizing who was responsible, and 
that person has now just become known to you. Who 
helped you in the past, whether or not you knew it at the 
time, and what do you owe that person as recompense? 
BENEFACTORS 
d6 
Benefactor 
A smuggler kept you from getting caught but lost a 
valuable shipment in doing so. Now you owe that 
person an equally valuable favor. 
2 
The Beggar King has hidden you from your pursu-
ers many times, in return for future considerations. 
3 
A magistrate once kept you out of jail in return for 
information on a powerful crime lord. 
4 
Your parents used their savings to bail you out of 
trouble in your younger days and are now destitute. 
S 
A dragon didn't eat you when it had a chance, and 
in return you promised to set aside choice pieces 
of treasure for it. 
6 
A druid once helped you out of a tight spot; now 
any random animal you see could be that benefac-
tor, perhaps come to claim a return favor. 
ROGUISH ARCHETYPES 
At 3rd level, a rogue gains the Roguish Archetype fea-
ture. The following options are available to a rogue, 
in addition to those offered in the Player's Handbook: 
the Inquisitive, the Mastermind, the Scout, and the 
Swashbuckler. 
INQUISITIVE 
As an archetypal Inquisitive, you excel at rooting out se-
crets and unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp 
eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to 
read the words and deeds of other creatures to deter-
mine their true intent. You excel at defeating creatures 
that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your 
mastery of lore and your keen deductions make you well 
equipped to expose and end hidden evils.

\ 
EYE FOR DETAIL 
Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to make 
a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature 
or object or to make an Intelligence (Investigation) 
check to uncover or decipher clues. 
INSIGHTFUL FIGHTING 
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an oppo-
nent's tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus 
action, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against 
a creature you can see that isn't incapacitated, contested 
by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If you suc-
ceed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target 
even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but 
not if you have disadvantage on it. 
This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you s uccess-
fully use this feature against a different target. 
STEADY EYE 
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on any Wisdom 
(Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you 
move no more than half your speed on the same turn. 
UNERRING EYE 
Beginning at 13th level, your senses are almost im-
possible to foi l. As an action, you sense the presence 
of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, 
and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 
30 feet of you, provided you aren't blinded or deafened. 
You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, 
but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its 
true nature. 
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 
your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you re-
gain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. 
EYE FOR WEAK NESS 
At 17th level, you learn to exploit a creature's weak-
nesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement. 
While your Insightful Fighting feature applies to a crea-
ture, your Sneak Attack damage against that creature 
increases by 3d6. 
MASTERMIND 
Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets 
they have. Ma ny spies, courtiers, and schemers follow 
this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your 
weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and 
favors are some of your favorite treasures.

CHAPTER I I CHARACTER OPTIONS 
MASTER OF INT RIGUE 
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, a nd one 
gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages 
of your choice. 
Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech 
patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak 
for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as 
a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you 
know the language. 
M ASTER OF TACTICS 
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a 
bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action 
to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that 
attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 
feet of you, if the target can see or hear you. 
INSIGHTFUL MANIPULATOR 
Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute 
observing or interacting with another creature outside 
combat, you can learn certain information about its ca-
pabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the 
creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to 
two of the following characteristics of your choice: 
• Intelligence score 
• Wisdom score 
Cha risma score 
• Class levels (if any) 
At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a 
piece of the creature's history or one of its personality 
traits, if it has any. 
MISDIRECTION 
Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause an-
other creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When 
you a re targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 
feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you 
can use your reaction to have the attack target that crea-
ture instead of you. 
SOUL O F DECEIT 
Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by 
telepathy or other means, unless you a llow it. You can 
present false thoughts by s ucceeding on a Charisma 
(Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wis-
dom (Insight) check. 
Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would 
determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are 
being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be com-
pelled to tell the truth by magic.
