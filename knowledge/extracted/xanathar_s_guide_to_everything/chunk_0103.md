CREATING A RIVAL 
Io essence, a rival is a somewhat specialized NPC. You 
can use chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to 
build a new NPC for this purpose, or pick one from your 
current cast of supporting characters and embellish that 
NPC as described below. 
It's possible for the characters to have two or three ri-
vals at a time, each with a separate agenda. At least one 
should be a villain, but the others might be neutral or 
good; conflicts with those rivals might be social or politi-
cal, rather than manifesting as direct attacks. 
The best rivals have a connection with their adver-
saries on a personal level. F ind links in the characters' 
backstories or the events of recent adventures that 
explain what sparked the rival's actions. The best trou-
ble to put the characters in is trouble they created for 
themselves.

To add the right amount of detail to a rival you want to 
create, give some thought to what that NPC is trying to 
accomplish and what resources and methods the rival 
can bring to bear against the characters. 
Goals. An effective rival has a clear reason for inter-
fering with the characters' lives. Think about what the 
rival wants, how and why the characters stand in the 
way, and how the conflict could be resolved. Ideally, a 
rival's goal directly involves the characters or something 
they care about. 
CHAPTER 2 
DUNGEON ~IASTER"S TOOLS 
Assets. Think about the resources the rival can mar-
shal. Does the character have enough money to pay 
bribes or to hire a small gang of mercenaries? Does 
the rival hold sway over any guilds, temples, or other 
groups? Make a list of the rival's assets, and consider 
how they can be used. 
Plans. The foundation of a rival's presence in the 
campaign is the actions the rival takes or the events that 
occur as a result of that character's goals. Each tjme you 
resolve one or more workweeks of downtime, pick one 
of the ways a rival's plans might be advanced and intro-
duce it into play. 
Think about how a rival might operate in order to 
bring specific plans to fruition, and jot down three or 
four kinds of actions the rival might undertake. Some 
of these might be versions of the downtime activities 
described later in this section, but these are more often 
efforts that are specific to the rival. 
A rival's action might be a direct attack, such as an as-
sassination attempt, that you play out during a session. 
Or it might be a background activity that you describe 
as altering the campaign in some way. For example, a 
rival who wants to increase the prestige of the temple 
of a war god might hold a festival with drink, food, and 
gladiatorial games. Even if the characters aren't directly 
involved, the event becomes the talk of the town. 
Some elements of a rival's plans might involve 
events in the world that aren't under the rival's control. 
Whether such an event can be easily anticipated or not, 
the rival's plans might include contingencies for taking 
advantage of such happenings. 
EXAMPLE RIVAL: MARINA RODEMUS 
The Rodemus clan was a small but powerful family of 
traders in the city, but years ago, they pulled up stakes 
and left town overnight. Marina Rodemus, the youngest 
child, has now returned to restore her family's prestige. 
In truth, the family fled because its members became 
afflicted by lycanthropy. They joined a clan ofwererats 
and delved into smuggling in a djstant city, out of fear 
that their secret would be impossible to keep in their 
former home. After fighting her way to the top ranks of 
the wererat clans, Marina-along with a small army of 
followers- has returned to claim her place among the 
elite of her home city. She vows that if she doesn't suc-
ceed, she'll leave the city in ruins. 
Goals. Marina wants to become the most respected, 
most important merchant in town-someone to whom 
even the prince must yield. 
Assets. Marina has a small fortune in gold; her abili-
ties as a wererat, alchemist, and necromancer; a group 
of wererats dedicated to her; and a shleld guardian that 
protects her. 
Plans. Marina works to discredit and ruin other mer-
chants. Her wererats spy on her opponents and sneak 
into warehouses, unleashing hordes of rats to spoil 
goods. Marina even victimizes a few of her own ware-
houses to avoid suspicion. 
If Marina's plans fail, she has a terrible alternative. 
Her knowledge of alchemy has enabled her to create a 
plague that she will unleash on the city through her rats. 
If she can't rule, then no one will.
