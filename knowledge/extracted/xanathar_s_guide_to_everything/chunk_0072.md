DIAGRAM 2.5 : CONES US ING T OKENS 
DIAGRAM 2.G: LI NES USING TOKENS 
When you place a template, follow all the rules in the 
Player's Handbook for placing the associated area of 
effect. If an area of effect, s uch as a cone or a line, origi-
nates from a spellcaster, the template s hould extend out 
from the caster a nd be positioned however the caster 
likes within the bounds of the rules. 
Diagrams 2.1 and 2.2 show the template method 
in action. 
TOKEN M ETHOD 
The token method is meant to make areas of effect 
tactile and fun. To use this method, grab some dice or 
other tokens, which you're going to use to represent your 
areas of effect. 
Rather than faithfully representing the s hapes of the 
different areas of effect, this method gives you a way to 
create square-edged versions of them on a grid easily, as 
described in the following subsections. 
Using Tokens. Every 5-foot squa re of an area of effect 
becomes a die or other token that you place on the grid. 
Each token goes inside a square, not at a n intersection 
of lines. If a n area's token is in a square, that square is 
included in the area of effect. It's that simple. 
Diagrams 2.3 through 2.6 s how this method in action, 
using dice as the tokens. 
Circles. This method depicts everything using 
squa res, and a circula r a rea of effect becomes square in 
it, whether the area is a sphere, cylinder, or radius. For 
ins ta nce, the 10-foot radius of flame strike, which bas a 
diameter of 20 feet, is expressed as a square that is 20 
feet on a side, as s hown in diagram 2.3. Diagram 2.4 
s hows that area with tota l cover inside it. 
Cones. A cone is represented by rows of tokens on the 
grid, extending from the cone's point of origin. In the 
rows, the squares are adjoining side by side or corner to 
corner, as shown in diagram 2.5. To determine the num-

ber of rows a cone contains, divide its length by 5. For 
example, a 30-foot cone contains six rows. 
Here's how to create the rows. Starting with a square 
adjacent to the cone's point of origin, place one token. 
The square can be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent 
to the point of origin. In every row beyond that one, 
place as many tokens as you placed in the previous row, 
plus one more token. Place this row's tokens so that 
their squares each share a side with a square in the 
previous row. If the cone is orthogonally adjacent to the 
point of origin, you'll have one more token to place in the 
row; place it on one end or the other of the row you just 
created (you don't have to pick the side chosen in dia-
gram 2.5). Keep placing tokens in this way until you've 
created all of the cone's rows. 
Lines. A line can extend from its source orthogonally 
or diagonally, as shown in diagram 2.6. 
ENCOUNTER BUILDING 
This section introduces new guidelines on building com-
bat encounters for an adventure. They are an alternative 
to the rules in "Creating Encounters" in chapter 3 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide. This approach uses the same 
math that underlies the rules presented in that book, but 
it makes a few adjustments to the way that math is pre-
sented to produce a more flexible system. 
This encounter-building system assumes that, as DM, 
you want to have a clear understanding of the threat 
posed by a group of monsters. It will be useful to you if 
you want to emphasize combat in your adventure, if you 
want to ensure that a foe isn't too deadly for a group of 
characters, and if you want to understand the relation-
ship between a character's level and a monster's chal-
lenge rating. 
Building an encounter using these guidelines follows 
a series of steps. 
STEP l: ASSESS THE CHARACTERS 
To build an encounter using this system, first take stock 
of the player characters. This system uses the charac-
ters' levels to determine the numbers and challenge 
ratings of creatures you can pit them against without 
making a fight too hard or too easy. Even though char-
acter level is important, you should also take note of 
each character's hit point maximum and saving throw 
modifiers, as well as how much damage the mightiest 
characters can deal with a single attack. Character level 
and challenge rating are good for defining the difficulty 
of an encounter, but they don't tell the whole story. You'll 
make use of these additional character statistics when 
you select monsters for an encounter in step 4. 
STEP 2: CHOOSE ENCOUNTER SIZE 
Determine whether you want to create a battle that pits 
one creature against the characters , or if you want to 
use multiple monsters. If the fight is against a single 
opponent, your best candidate for that foe is one of the 
game's legendary creatures, which are designed to fill 
this need. If the battle involves multiple monsters, de-
cide roughly how many creatures you want to use before 
continuing with step 3. 
STEP 3: DETERMINE NUMBERS AND 
CHALLENGE RATINGS 
The process for building fights that feature only one leg-
endary monster is simple. The Solo Monster Challenge 
Rating table shows you which cha llenge rating (CR) to 
use for a legendary creature opposing a party of four to 
six characters, creating a satisfying but difficult battle. 
For example, for a party of five 9th-level characters, a 
CR 12 legendary creature makes an optimal encounter. 
For a more perilous battle, match up the characters 
with a legendary creature whose cha llenge rating is 1 or 
2 higher than optimal. For an easy fight, use a legendary 
creature whose challenge rating is 3 or more lower than 
the challenge rating for an optimal encounter.

If your encounter features multiple monsters, bala nc-
ing it takes a little more work. Refer to the Multiple 
Monsters tables, which are broken up by level ranges, 
providing information for how to balance encounters for 
characters of 1st-5th level, 6th- 10th level, 11th- 15th 
level, and 16th- 20th level. 
First, you need to note the challenge rating for each 
creature the party will face. Then, to create your encoun-
ter, find the level of each character on the appropriate ta-
ble. Each table shows what a single character of a given 
level is equivalent to in terms of challenge rating-a 
value represented by a ratio that compares numbers of 
characters to a single monster ranked by challenge rat-
ing. The first number in each expression is the number 
of characters of the given level. The second number tells 
how many monsters of the listed cha llenge rating those 
characters are equivalent to.
