MASTER'S FLOURISH 
Starting at 14th level, whenever you use a Blade Flour-
ish option, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expend-
ing a Bardic Inspiration die. 
COLLEGE OF WHISPERS 
Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. 
Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their ad-
vantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing 
news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences 
they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its 
students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards 
use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and 
turn them against others through extortion and threats. 
Many other ba rds hate the College of Whispers, 
viewing it as a parasite that uses a bard's reputation to 
acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members 
of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typ-
icalJy claim to follow some other college, or they keep 
their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and ex-
ploit royal courts a nd other settings of power.

PSYCHIC BLADES 
When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you 
gain the ability to ma ke your weapon attacks magically 
toxic to a creature's mind. 
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you 
can expend one use of your Bardic Ins piration to deal an 
extra 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so 
only once per round on your turn. 
The psychic damage increases when you reach cer-
tain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 
5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level. 
WORDS OF TERROR 
At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words 
with a n insidious magic that can inspire terror. 
If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, 
you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the 
end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a 
Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be 
frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The 
target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is at-
tacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being 
attacked or damaged. 
CHAPTER 1 J CHARACTER O PTIONS 
If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target 
has no hint that you tried to frighten it. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest. 
MANTLE OF WHISPERS 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a huma noid's 
persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, 
you can magically capture its shadow using your reac-
tion. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finis h 
a long rest. 
You can use the s hadow as a n action. When you do so, 
it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that 
appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but 
healthy and a'live. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until 
you end it as a bonus action. 
While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all 
information that the humanoid would freely share with 
a casual acquaintance. Such information includes gen-
eral details on its background and personal life, but 
doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that 
you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on 
its memories. 
Another creature can see through this disguise by 
succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by 
your Cha risma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus 
to your check. 
Once you capture a s hadow with this feature, you 
can't capture another one with it until you finish a short 
or long rest. 
SHADOW LORE 
At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic 
into your words and tap into a creature's deepest fears. 
As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that 
only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you 
can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw 
against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds 
if it doesn't share a language with you or ii it can't hear 
you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds 
like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect. 
On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you 
for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, 
damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It inter-
prets the whispers as a description of its most mortify-
ing secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the 
target is convinced you know it. 
The cha rmed creature obeys your commands for fear 
that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for 
you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to 
do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a 
close friend. 
When the effect ends, the creature has no understand-
ing of why it held you in such fear. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest.
