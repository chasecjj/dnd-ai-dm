SCOUT 
You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the 
streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your 
companions during expeditions. Rogues who embrace 
this archetype are at home in the wilderness and among 
barbarians and rangers, and many Scouts serve as the 
eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty 
hunter- these are j ust a few of the roles that Scouts as-
sume as they range the world.

S KIR MISHER 
Starting at 3rd level, you are difficult to pin down during 
a fight. You can move up to half your speed as a reaction 
when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This 
movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. 
S URVI VALIST 
W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level. you gain 
proficiency in the Nature and Survival skills if you don't 
already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for 
any ability check you make that uses either of those pro-
ficiencies. 
SUPERI OR M OBILITY 
At 9th level. your w alking speed increases by 10 feet. If 
you have a climbing or swimming speed, this increase 
applies to that speed as well. 
A MBUS H M ASTER 
Starting at 13th level, you excel at leading ambushes 
and acting first in a fight. 
You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the 
first creature you hit during the first round of a combat 
becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls 
against that target have advantage until the start of your 
next turn. 
S U DDEN STRIKE 
Starting at 17th level, you can strike w ith deadly speed. 
Jf you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make 
one additional attack as a bonus action. This attack can 
benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already 
used it this turn, but you can't use your S neak Attack 
against the same target more than once in a turn. 
SWASHBUCKLER 
You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying 
on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While 
some warr iors are br utes clad in heavy armor, your 
method of fighting looks almost like a per formance. Du-
elists and pirates typically belong to this archetype. 
A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can 
fight w ith two weapons while safely darting away from 
an opponent.

FA NCY FOOTWORK 
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn 
how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. 
During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a 
creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks 
against you for the rest of your turn. 
R AKISH AU DACITY 
Star ting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into 
battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative 
rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. 
You also gain an additional way to use your S neak At-
tack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use 
your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 
feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and 
you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the 
other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you. 
PANACHE 
At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily be-
guiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Per-
suasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (In-
sight) check. T he creature must be able to hear you, and 
the two of you must share a language. 
If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile 
to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against tar-
gets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks 
against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 
minute, until one of your companions attacks the target 
or affects it w ith a spell, or unti l you and the target are 
more than 60 feet apar t. 
If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't 
hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. W hile 
charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. T his 
effect ends immediately if you or your companions do 
any thing harmful to it. 
ELEGANT MA N EU VER 
Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on 
your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Ac-
robatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during 
the same turn. 
M ASTE R D UELIST 
Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets 
you turn failure into success in combat. If you m iss with 
an attack roll, you can roll it again w ith advantage. Once 
you do so, you can't use this feature again until you fin-
ish a shor t or long rest.
