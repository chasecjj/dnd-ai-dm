CL.ER IC. OF THE F ORGE 
SERVING A PA NTHEON , PHILOSOPH Y, OR FORCE 
The typical cleric is an ordained servant of a particular god 
and chooses a Divine Domain associated with that deity. 
The cleric's magic flows from the god or the god's sacred 
realm, and often the cleric bears a holy symbol that rep-
resents that divinity. 
Some clerics, especially in a world like Eberron, serve a 
whole pantheon, rather than a single deity. In certain cam-
paigns, a cleric might instead serve a cosmic force, such 
as life or death, or a philosophy or concept, such as love, 
peace, or one of the nine alignments. Chapter 1 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide explores options like these, in the 
section "Gods ofYour World." 
Talk with your DM about the divine options available in 
your campaign, whether they're gods, pantheons, philos-
ophies, or cosmic forces. Whatever being or thing your 
cleric ends up serving, choose a Divine Domain that is ap-
propriate for it, and if it doesn't have a holy symbol, work 
with your DM to design one. 
The cleric's class features often refer to your deity. If you 
are devoted to a pantheon, cosmic force, or philosophy, 
your cleric features still work for you as written. Think of 
the references to a god as references to the divine thing 
you serve that gives you your magic. 
CHAPTER 1 I CH ARACTER OPTIONS 
DIVINE DOMAINS 
At 1st level, a cleric gains the Divine Domain feature. 
The following domain options are available to a cleric, 
in addition to those offered in the Player's Handbook: 
Forge and Grave. 
FORGE DOMAIN 
The gods of the forge are patrons of a rtisans who work 
with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a 
village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf 
artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have 
felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, 
with patience and hard work, even the most intractable 
metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beau-
tifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search 
for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines 
overrun by ores, and uncover rare and wondrous mate-
rials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers 
of these gods take great pride in their work, and they 
are willing to craft and use heavy armor and power-
ful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain 
include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Morad in, Hephaestus, 
and Goibhniu.
