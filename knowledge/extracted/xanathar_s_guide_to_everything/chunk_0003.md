a re the cha racters created by the players. 
The heroics, folly, righteous ness, and po-
tential villainy of your cha racters are at the 
heart of the story. This chapter provides a 
variety of new options for the m, focusing 
on additiona l subclasses for each of the 
classes in the Player's Handbook. 
Each class offers a character-defining choice at 1st, 
2nd, or 3rd level that unlocks a series of special fea-
tures, not available to the class as a whole. That choice 
is called a subclass. Each class has a collective term 
that describes its subclasses; in the fighter, for instance, 
the subclasses are called martial archetypes, a nd in the 
paladin, they're sacred oaths. The table below identifies

each of the subclasses in this book. In addition, the sec-
tion for druids presents details on how the Wild Shape 
feature works, and the warlock receives a collection of 
new choices for the class's E ldritch Invocations feature. 
Each of the class presentations leads off with advice 
on how to add depth and detail to your character's per-
sonality. You can use the tables in these sections as a 
source of inspiration, or roll a die to randomly deter-
mine a result if desired. 
Following the subclasses, the section called "This Is 
Your Life" presents a series of tables for adding deta il to 
your character's backstory. 
The chapter concludes with a selection of feats for the 
races in the Player's Handbook, offering ways to delve 
deeper into a character's racial identity.
