FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
Who raised you, and what was life like for you when you 
were growing up? You might have been raised by your 
parents, by relatives, or in an orphanage. Or you could 
have spent your childhood on the streets of a crowded 
city with only your fellow runaways a nd orphans to keep 
you company. 
Use the Family table to determine who raised you. If 
you know who your parents are but you get a result that 
does not mention one or both of them, use the Absent 
Parent table to determine what happened. 
Next, refer to the Family Lifestyle table to determine 
the general circumstances of your upbringing. (Chapter 
5 of the Player's Handbook has more information about 
lifestyles.) The result on that table includes a number 
that is applied to your roll on the Childhood Home table, 
which tells you where you spent your early years. Wrap 
up this section by using the Childhood Memories table, 
which tells you how you were treated by other young-
sters as you were growing up. 
Supplemental Tables. You can roll on the Relation-
ship table to determine how your family members or 
other important figures in your life feel about you. You 
can also use the Race, Occupation, and Alignment ta-
bles to learn more about the family members or guard-
ians who raised you.

PERSO NAL DECISIONS 
Your character's life takes a particular course depend-
ing on the choices you make for the character's back-
ground and class. 
BACKGROUND 
Roll on the appropriate table in this section as soon as 
you decide your background, or at any later time if you 
choose. If a background includes a special decision 
point, such as a folk hero's defining event or the spe-
cialty of a criminal or a sage, it's best to make that deter-
mination before using the pertinent table below. 
ACOLYTE 
d6 
I became an acolyte because ... 
I ran away from home at an early age and found 
refuge in a temple. 
2 
My family gave me to a temple, since they were un-
able or unwilling to care for me.

6 
I grew up in a household with strong religious con-
victions. Entering the service of one or more gods 
seemed natural. 
An impassioned sermon struck a chord deep in my 
soul and moved me to serve the faith. 
I followed a childhood friend, a respected acquain-
tance, or someone I loved into religious service. 
After encountering a true servant of the gods, I was 
so inspired that I immediately entered the service 
of a religious group. 
CHARLATAN 
d6 
I became a charlatan because ... 
I was left to my own devices, and my knack for ma-
nipulating others helped me survive. 
2 
I learned early on that people are gullible and easy 
to exploit. 
3 
I often got in trouble, but I managed to talk my way 
out of it every time. 
4 
I took up with a confidence artist, from whom I 
learned my craft. 
5 
After a charlatan fleeced my family, I decided to 
learn the trade so I would never be fooled by such 
deception again. 
6 
I was poor or I feared becoming poor, so I learned 
the tricks I needed to keep myself out of poverty.
