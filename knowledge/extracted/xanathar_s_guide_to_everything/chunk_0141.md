Any creature in the sphere's s pace must make a 
Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature 
is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied 
space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A 
Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw 
automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can 
choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained 
by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of 
each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the sav-
ing throw, ending the effect on itself on a s uccess. 
The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or 
smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere 
restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capac-
ity, a ra ndom creature that was already restrained by the 
sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 
feet of it. 
As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet 
in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other 
drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feel 
above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere 
moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, 
forcing them to make the saving throw. 
When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground 
and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. 
Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone 
in the s pace where it falls. The water then vanishes. 
WHIRLWIND 
7th-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 300 feet 
Components: V, M (a piece of straw) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can 
see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 
10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that 
point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to 
move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along 
the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or 
smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that 
aren't worn or carried by anyone. 
A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the 
first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that 
the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirl-
wind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature 
that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving 
throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the 
spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by 
the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside 
it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature 
moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, 
unless the creature has some means to stay aloft. 
A restrained creature can use an action to make a 
Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. 
If s uccessful, the creature is no longer restrained by the 
whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 x 10 feet away from it in a 
random direction. 
WORD OF RADIANCE 
Evocation cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 5 feet 
Components: V, M (a holy symbol) 
Duration: Instantaneous 
You utter a divine word, and burning radiance erupts 
from you. Each creature of your choice that you can see 
within range must succeed on a Constitution saving 
throw or take ld6 radiant damage. 
The spell's damage increases by ld6 when you reach 
5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). 
WRATH OF NATURE 
5th-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them 
against your enemies. Choose a point you can see 
within range. The s pirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses 
in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become ani-
mated until the spell ends. 
Grasses and Undergrowth. Any area of ground in the 
cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult 
terrain for your enemies. 
Trees. At the start of each of your turns, each of your 
enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must suc-
ceed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 slashing 
damage from whipping branches. 
Roots and Vines. At the end of each of your turns, one 
creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube 
must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become 
restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature 
can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check 
against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on 
a s uccess. 
Rocks. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause 
a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can 
see in the cube. Make a ranged s pell attack against the 
target. On a bit, the target takes 3d8 nonmagical blud-
geoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength 
saving throw or fall prone. 
ZEPHYR STRIKE 
1st-level transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 bonus action 
Range: Self 
Components: V 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
You move like the wind. Until the spell ends, your move-
ment doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. 
Once before the spell ends, you can give yourself ad-
vantage on one weapon attack roll on your turn. That at-
tack deals an extra ld8 force damage on a hit. Whether 
you hit or miss, your walking speed increases by 30 feet 
until the end of that turn.
