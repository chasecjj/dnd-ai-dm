stack up against your group. Hit points, attacks, and 
saving throws are all usefuJ indicators. Compare the 
damage a monster can deal to the hit point maximum of 
each character. Be wary of any monster that is capable 
of dropping a character with a single attack, unless you 
are designing the fight to be especially deadly. 
In the same way, compare the monsters' hit points to 
the damage output of the party's strongest characters, 
again looking for targets that can be killed with one 
blow. Having a significant number of foes drop in the 
first rounds of combat can make an encounter too easy. 
Likewise, look at whether a monster's deadliest 
abilities call for saving throws that most of the party 
members are weak with, and compare the characters' 
offensive abilities to the monsters' saving throws. 
If the only creatures you can choose from at the de-
sired challenge rating aren't a good match for the char-
acters' statistics, don't be afraid to go back to step 3. By 
altering your challenge rating targets and adjusting the

number of creatures in the encounter, you can come up 
with different options for building the e ncounter. 
STEP 5: Ann FLAVOR 
The events that unfold during an encounter have to do 
with a lot more than swinging weapons a nd casting 
spells. The most interesting confrontations also take 
into account the personality or behavior of the monsters, 
perhaps determining whether they can be communi-
cated with or whether they're all acting in concert. Other 
possible factors include the nature of the physical envi-
ronment, such as whether it includes obstacles or other 
features that might come into play, and the ever-present 
possibility of something unexpected taking place. 
If you al ready have ideas for how to flesh out your 
encounter in these ways, go right a head and finish your 
creation. Otherwise, take a look at the following sec-
tions for some basic advice on adding flavor elements to 
the simple mechanics of the fight.
