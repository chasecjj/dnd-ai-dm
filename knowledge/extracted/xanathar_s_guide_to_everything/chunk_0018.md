one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoc-
cupied s pace you can see. 
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 
your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), a nd you re-
gain all expended uses of it when you fi nish a long r est. 
WALKER IN D REAMS 
At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you 
the ability to travel menta lly or physically through 
dreamlands. 
W hen you finis h a short rest, you can cast one of the 
following spells, without expending a spell slot or re-
quiring material components: dream (with you as the 
messenger), scrying, or te/eportation circle. 
T his use of teleportation circle is specia l. Rather than 
opening a portal to a perma nent teleportation circle, it 
opens a portal to the last location where you finished 
a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you 
haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the 
spell fails but isn't was ted. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 
until you finis h a long rest. 
CIRCLE O F THE SHEPHERD 
Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune 
with the spirits of nature, especially the s pirits 
of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for 
aid. These druids recognize that all living things 
play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on 
protecting animals and fey creatures that have 
difficulty defending themselves. S hepherds, as they are 
known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward 
off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who 
kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization 
from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites 
sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far 
from cities and towns, content to s pend their days in the 
company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds. 
Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose 
forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge 
and power that will help them safeguard their charges 
better. Wherever these druids go, the s pirits of the wil-
de rness are with them.

SPEECH OF THE WOODS 
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts 
a od many fey. 
You learn to speak, read, a nd write Sylvan. In addi-
tion, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain 
the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most 
beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand 
sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beas t could relay 
what it has seen or heard in the recent pas t. This ability 
doesn't grant you friendship with beasts, though you can 
DRUID OF THE CIRC.LE OF THE SHEPHERD 
combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them 
as you would with a ny nonplayer character. 
SPIRIT TOTEM 
Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to 
influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you 
can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point 
you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates a n 
aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as 
neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spec-
tra l appearance of the creature it represents. 
As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 
feet to a point you can see. 
The s pirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapac-
itated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 
until you finish a s hort or long rest. 
The effect of.the s pirit's aura depends on the type of 
spirit you summon from the options below. 
Bear Spirit. T he bear s pirit grants you and your allies 
its might and endura nce. Each creature of your choice 
in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary 
hit points equal to 5 +your druid level. In addition, you 
and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and 
Strength saving throws while in the aura. 
Hawk Spirit. The hawk spirit is a consummate 
hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. 
When a creature makes an attack roll against a target 
in the spirit's aura, you cao use your reaction to grant 
advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your 
a!Ues have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
while in the aura.
