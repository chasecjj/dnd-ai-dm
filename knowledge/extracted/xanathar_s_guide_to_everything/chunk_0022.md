Banishing Arrow. You use abjuration magic to try to 
temporarily banish your ta rget to a harmless location 
in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also 
succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. 
While ba nis hed in this way, the target's speed is 0, and 
it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target 
reappears in the s pace it vacated or in the nearest unoc-
cupied s pace if that space is occupied. 
After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also 
takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it. 
Beguiling Arrow. Your encha ntment magic causes 
this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature 
hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, a nd 
choose one of your aJJies within 30 feet of the target. 
The target must s ucceed on a Wisdom saving throw, or 
it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your 
next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally at-
tacks the charmed target, deals da mage to it, or forces it 
to make a saving throw. 
The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 
18th level in this class. 
Bursting Arrow. You imbue your arrow with force 
energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy 
detonates after your attack. Immediately after the ar-
row hits the creature, the target and all other creatures 
within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force da mage each. 
The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 
18th level in this class. 
Enfeebling Arrow. You weave necromantic magic into 
your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 
2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also s ucceed 
on a Cons titution saving throw, or the damage dealt 
by its weapon attacks is ha lved until the start of your 
next turn. 
The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 
18th level in this class. 
Grasping Arrow. When this arrow s trikes its target, 
conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous bram -
bles, which wrap around the target. T he creature hit by 
the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison da mage, its speed 
is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashfog dam-
age the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more 
without teleporting. T he target or any creature that can 
reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with 
a s uccessful S trength (Athletics) check against your Ar-
cane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 
minute or until you use this option again. 
The poison damage and s lashing damage both in-
crease to 4d6 ~hen you reach 18th level in this class. 
Piercing Arrow. You use transmutation magic to 
give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this 
option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. 
Ins tead, the arrow shoots forward in a line, which is 1 
foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The 
arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring 
cover. Each creature in that line must make a D exterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage 
as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra ld6 piercing 
damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as 
much damage. 
The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 
18th level in this class.
