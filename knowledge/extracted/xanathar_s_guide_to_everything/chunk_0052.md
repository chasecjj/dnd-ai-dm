I became a sage because ... 
I was naturally curious, so I packed up and went to 
a university to learn more about the world. 
My mentor's teachings opened my mind to new 
possibilities in that field of study. 
I was always an avid reader, and I learned much 
about my favorite topic on my own.

I discovered an old library and pored over the texts 
I found there. That experience awakened a hunger 
for more knowledge.

I impressed a wizard who told me I was squander-
ing my talents and should seek out an education to 
take advantage of my gifts.

One of my parents or a relative gave me a basic ed-

to build on what I had learned.

sea.

I needed to escape my community quickly, so I 
stowed away on a ship. When the crew found me, I 
was forced to work for my passage.

Invaders attacked my homeland. It was my duty to 
take up arms in defense of my people. 
I became an urchin because ... 
Wanderlust caused me to leave my family to see

My devotion to my people lifted me in battle, mak-
ing me powerful and dangerous. 
The spirits of my ancestors called on me to carry 
out a great task. 
I lost control in battle one day, and it was as if 
something else was manipulating my body, forcing 
it to kill every foe I could reach. 
I went on a spiritual journey to find myself and 
instead found a s pirit animal to guide, protect, and 
inspire me. 
I was struck by lightning and lived. Afterward, I 
fou nd a new strength within me that let me push 
beyond my limitations. 
My anger needed to be channeled into battle, or I 
risked becoming an indiscriminate killer. 
I became a bard because ... 
I awakened my latent bardic abilities through trial 
and error. 
I was a gifted performer and attracted the atten-
tion of a master bard who schooled me in the o ld 
techniques. 
I joined a loose society of scholars and orators to 
learn new techniques of performance and magic. 
I felt a calling to recount the deeds of champions 
and heroes , to bring them alive in song and story. 
I joined one of the great colleges to learn old lore, 
the secrets of magic, and the art of performance. 
I picked up a musical instrument o ne day and in-
stantly discovered that I could play it.
