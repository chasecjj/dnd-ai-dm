WIZARD 
WIZARDRY REQUIRES UNDERSTANDlNC. THE KNOWLEDGE 
of how and why magic works, and our efforts to broaden 
that understanding, have brought about the key advances 
in civilization over the centuries. 
- Gimble the illusionist 
Only a select few people in the world are wielders of 
magic. Of all those, wizards stand at the pinnacle of 
the craft. Even the least of them can manipulate forces 
that flout the laws of nature, and the most accomplished 
among them can cast spells with world-shaking effects. 
The price that wizards pay for their mastery is that 
most valuable of commodities: time. It takes years of 
study, instruction, and experimentation to learn how to 
harness magical energy and carry s pells around in one's 
own mind. For adventuring wizards a nd other spellcast-
ers who aspire to the highest echelons of the profession, 
the studying never ends, nor does the quest for knowl-
edge and power. 
If you're playing a wizard, take advantage of the 
opportunity to make your character more than just a 
stereotypical spell-slinger. Use the advice that follows to 
add some intriguing details to how your wizard interacts 
with the world. 
SPELLBOOK 
Your wizard character's most prized possession- your 
spellbook- might be an innocuous-looking volume 
whose covers show no hint of what's inside. Or you 
might display some flair, as many wizards do, by car-
rying a spellbook of an unusual sort. If you don't own 
s uch an item already, one of your goals might be to find 
a spellbook that sets you apart by its appearance or its 
means of manufacture.

AMBITION 
Few aspiring wizards undertake the study of magic 
without some personal goal in mind. Many wizards use 
their spells as a tool to produce a tangible benefit, in ma-
terial goods or in status, for themselves or their compan-
ions. For others, the theoretical aspect of magic might 
have a strong appeal, pushing those wizards to seek out 
knowledge that supports new theories of the arcane or 
confirms old ones. 
Beyond the obvious, why does your wizard character 
study magic, a nd what do you want to achieve? If you ha-
ven't given these questions much thought, you can do so 
now, and the answers you come up with will likely affect 
how your future unfolds.
