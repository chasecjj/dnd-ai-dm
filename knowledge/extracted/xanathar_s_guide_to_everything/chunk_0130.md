cupied space that you can see within range. The illusion 
lasts for the spell's duration and occupies its space, as if 
it were a creature. 
When the illusion appears, any of your enemies that 
can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or 
become frightened of it for 1 minute. If a frightened crea-
ture ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line 
of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, 
ending the effect on itself on a success. 
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illu-
sion up to 60 feet. At any point during its movement, you 
can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone 
originating from its space. When you create the dragon, 
choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, ne-
crotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make 
an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the 
chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
The illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff 
used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically, it s uc-
ceeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all dam-
age and conditions. A creature that uses an action to 
examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion 
by succeeding on an Intelligence (Jnvestigation) check 
against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the 
illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and 
has advantage on saving throws against its breath. 
IMMOLATION 
5th-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. 
The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 
8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or ha lf as much dam-
age on a successful one. On a failed save, the target 
also burns for the spell's duration. The burning target 
sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for 
an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the 
target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage 
on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. 
These magical fla mes can't be extinguished by nonmag-
ical means. 
If damage from this spell kills a target, the target is 
turned to ash. 
INFERNAL CALLING 
5th-level conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 90 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a ruby worth at least 999 gp) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 
Uttering a dark incantation, you summon a devil from 
the Nine Hells. You choose the devil's type, which must 
be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a barbed 
CHAPTER 3 I SPELLS 
devil or a bearded devil. The devil appears in an unoc-
cupied space that you can see within range. The devil 
disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the 
spell ends. 
The devil is unfriendly toward you and your com-
panions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own 
turns. It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts 
according to its nature on each of its turns, which might 
result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or 
trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange 
for limited service. The DM has the creature's statistics. 
On each of your turns, you can try to iss ue a verbal 
command to the devil (no action required by you). It 
obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accor-
dance with its desires, especially if the result would 
draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Cha-
risma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check 
contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. You make the 
check with advantage if you say the devil's true name. 
If your check fails, the devil becomes immune to your 
verbal comma nds for the duration of the spell, though it 
can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your 
check succeeds, the devil carries out your command-
such as "attack my enemies," "explore the room ahead," 
or "bear this message to the queen"- until it completes 
the activity, at which point it returns to you to report hav-
ing done so. 
If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its 
full duration, the devil doesn't disappear if it has become 
immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts in 
whatever manner it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then it 
disappears. 
If you possess an individual devil's talisman, you can 
summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge 
rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no 
Charisma checks required. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating in-
creases by 1 for each slot level above 5th. 
INFESTATION 
Conjuration cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: Y, S, M (a living flea) 
Duration: Instantaneous 
You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to 
appear momentarily on one creature you can see within 
range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving 
throw, or it takes ld6 poison damage and moves 5 feet 
in a random direction if it can move a nd its speed is at 
least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 
3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke op-
portunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, 
the target doesn't move. 
The spell's damage increases by ld6 when you reach 
5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
