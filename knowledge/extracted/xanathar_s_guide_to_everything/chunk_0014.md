BONUS PROFI CIENCI ES 
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain pro-
ficiency with heavy armor and smith's tools. 
BLESSING OF THE F ORGE 
At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into 
a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can 
touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or 
a simple or ma rtial weapon. Until the end of your next 
long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic 
item, gra nting a +1 bonus to AC if it's a rmor or a +1 bo-
nus to attack a nd damage rolls if it's a weapon. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finis h a long rest. 
C H ANNEL D IVINITY: A RTISAN'S BLESSI NG 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity 
to create simple items. 
You conduct a n hour-long ritua l that cra fts a nonmagi-
cal item that must include some metal: a simple or mar-
tial weapon, a s uit of a rmor, ten pieces of a mmunition, 
a set of tools, or another metal object (see chapter 5, 
"Equipment," in the Player's Handbook for exam ples of 
these items). The creation is completed at the end of the 
hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice 
on a s urface within 5 feet of you. 
T he thing you create can be something that is worth 
no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritua l, you must lay 
out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal 
to the creation. The metal irretrievably coa lesces and 
tra nsforms into the creation at the ritual's end, magi-
cally forming even nonmetal parts of the creation. 
The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item 
that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the 
original during the ritual. 
SOU L OF THE FORGE 
Sta rting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants 
you s pecial abilities: 
• You gain resistance to fi re da mage. 
• While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 
bonus to AC. 
DIVI NE S T R IK E 
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon 
strikes with the fiery power of the forge. Once on each 
of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon 
attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire 
damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the ex-
tra da mage increases to 2d8. 
C LERIC. OF T HE GRl\VE 
SAI NT O F F ORGE AND FIRE 
At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal 
becomes more powerful: 
• You gain immunity to fire damage. 
• While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to 
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-
magical attacks. 
GRAVE DOMAIN 
Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and 
death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a 
foundationa l pa rt of the multiverse. To desecrate the 
peace of the dead is a n abomination. Deities of the grave 
include Kelemvor, WeeJas, the ancestra l s pirits of the 
Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers 
of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, 
destroy the undead, a nd ease the suffering of the dying. 
Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a 
time, particula rly for a person who still has some great 
work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, 
not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.
