time its active element is triggered. As water floods a 
chamber, the characters must swim across areas they 
could walk through just a round or two earlier. 
Since a complex trap remains active over the course 
of several rounds, it might be possible to predict its 
future behavior by examining how it functions. This 
information can give its targets a much better chance of 
thwarting it. To minimize this possibility, design your 
trap so that it presents multiple threats that can change 
each round. The changes can include how a trap targets 
creatures (different attacks or saving throws), the dam-
age or effects it produces, the areas it covers, and so 
on. Some traps might have a random effect each round, 
while others follow a carefully programmed sequence 
of attacks. 
Dynamic elements usually occur according to a sched-
ule. For a room that floods, you can plan out how the 
rising water level affects the area each round. The water 
might be ankle deep at the end of the first round, knee 
deep the next, and so on. Not only does the water bring a 
risk of drowning, it also makes it harder to move across 
the area. On the other hand, the rising water level might 
allow characters to swim to the upper reaches of the 
chamber that they couldn't get to from the floor. 
Dynamic elements can a lso come into play in reaction 
to the characters' actions. Disarming one element of the 
trap might make the others deadlier. Disabling a rune 
that triggers a fire-breathing statue might cause the 
statue to explode.

TRIGGERS 
The advice on triggers given for simple traps also ap-
plies to complex traps, with one exception. Complex 
traps have multiple triggers, or are designed such that 
avoiding a trigger prevents intruders from reaching the 
area the trap guards. Other complex traps use magical 
triggers that activate on specific cues, such as when a 
door opens or someone enters an area without wearing 
the correct badge, amulet, or robe. 
Look at your map and consider when you want the 
trap to spring into action. It's best to have a complex trap 
trigger after the characters have committed to exploring 
a n area. A simple trap might activate when the charac-
ters open a door. A complex trap that triggers so early 
leaves the characters still outside the trapped room, in 
a place where they could decide to close the door and 
move on. A simple trap aims to keep intruders out. A 
complex trap wants to lure them in, so that when it acti-
vates, the intruders must deal with the trap before they 
can escape. 
The trigger for a complex trap should be as foolproof 
as you can make it. A complex trap represents a serious 
expenditure of effort and magical power. No one builds 
such a trap and makes it easy to avoid. Wisdom (Per-
ception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks might 
be unable to spot a trigger, especially a magical one, but 
they can still give hints about the trap before it triggers. 
Bloodstains, ashes, gouges in the floor, and other clues 
of that sort can serve as evidence of the trap's presence. 
INITIATIVE 
A complex trap acts repeatedly, but unlike characters 
and monsters, traps don't roll for initiative. As mechan-
ical or magical devices, their active elements operate in 
a periodic manner. When designing a complex trap, you 
need to decide when and how often its active elements 
produce their effects. 
In a trap with multiple active elements that work in 
concert, those different elements would act on different 
initiative counts. For instance, on initiative count 20, 
blades sweep across a treasure vault, driving the charac-
ters back into the hallway. On initiative count 10, magic 
darts fire from statues in the hallway while a portcullis 
falls to confine the characters. 
Initiative 10. If a trap's active element takes time to 
build up its effects, then it acts on initiative count 10. 
This option is good for a trap that functions alongside 
allied monsters or other guardians; the delay before it 
acts can give guards the chance to move out of its area 
or force characters into the area before the trap triggers. 
Initiative 20. If an element is designed to surprise 
intruders and hit them before they can react, then it acts 
on initiative count 20. This option is generally best for a 
complex trap. Think of it as the default. Such a trap acts 
quickly enough to take advantage of most characters, 
with nimble characters like rogues, rangers, and monks 
having the best chance to move out of the area before 
the element activates. 
Initiative 20 and 10. Some active elements are in-
credibly fast acting, laying waste to intruders in a few 
moments unless countered. They act on initiative count 
20 and 10.
