Range: Touch

sumes, that was harvested with a golden sickle under 
the light of a full moon) 
Duration: 24 hours 
You invoke the spirits of nature to protect an area out-
doors or underground. The area can be as small as a 
30-foot cube or as la rge as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and 
other structures are excluded from the affected area. If 
you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, 
the spell lasts until dispelled. 
The spell creates the following effects within the area. 
When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as 
friends who are immune to the effects. You can also 
specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the 
speaker immune to these effects. 
The entire warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic 
cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the 
following effects, not the entire area. That spell's caster 
chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are 
gone is this spell dispelled. 
Solid Fog. You can fill any number of 5-foot squares 
on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily ob-
scured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every 
foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a 
creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing 
and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light float-
ing in the air. 
Grasping Undergrowth. You can fill any number of 
5-foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog 
CHAPTER 3 I SPELLS 
with grasping weeds a nd vines, as if they were affected 
by a n entangle spell. To a creature immune to this effect, 
the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to 
serve as temporary seats or beds. 
Grove Guardians. You can animate up to four trees 
in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from 
the ground. These trees have the same statistics as an 
awakened tree, which appears in the Monster Manual, 
except they can't speak, and their bark is covered with 
druidic symbols. If a ny creature not immune to this 
effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight 
until they have driven off or sla in the intruders. The 
grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no 
action required by you) that you issue while in the area. 
If you don't give them comma nds and no intruders are 
present, the grove gua rdia ns do nothing. The grove 
guardians can't leave the warded area. When the spell 
ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the 
trees take root again if possible. 
Additional Spell Effect. You can place your choice 
of one of the following magical effects within the 
warded area: 
• A constant gust of wind in two locations of your choice 
• Spil<e growth in one location of your choice 
• Wind wall in two locations of your choice 
To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a 
fragrant, gentle breeze, a nd the area of spil<e growth 
is harmless.

dust devil must make a Strength saving throw. On a 
failed save, the creature takes ld8 bludgeoning damage 
and is pushed 10 feet away from the dust devil. On a suc-
cessful save, the creature takes half as much damage 
and isn't pushed. 
As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 
30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over 
sand, dust, loose dirt, or light gravel, it sucks up the ma-
terial and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around 
itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The 
cloud heavily obscures its area.
