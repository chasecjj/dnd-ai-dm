WARLOCK OF 
THE CELESTIAL 
BINDING MARK 
Some patrons make a habit of, and often enjoy, mark-
ing the warlocks under their sway io some fashion. A 
binding mark makes it clear-to those who know about 
such things- that the individual in question is bound to 
the patron's service. A warlock might take advantage of 
such a mark, claiming it as proof of one's pact, or might 
want to keep it under wraps (if possible) to avoid the dif-
ficulties it might bring. 
If your warlock's pact comes with a binding mark, 
how you feel about displaying it probably depends on the 
nature of your relationship with the one who gave it to 
you. Is the mark a source of pride or something you are 
secretly ashamed of?

One of your eyes looks the same as one of your 
patron's eyes. 
Each time you wake up, the small blemish on your 
face appears in a different place. 
You display outward symptoms of a disease but 
suffer no ill effects from it. 
Your tongue is an unnatural color. 
You have a vestigial tail. 
Your nose glows in the dark. 
CHAPTER 1 I CHARACTER OPTTONS 
OTHERWORLDLY PATRONS 
At 1st level, a warlock gains the Otherworldly Patron 
feature. The following options are available to a warlock, 
in addition to those offered in the Player's Handbook: 
the Celestial and the Hexblade. 
THE CELESTIAL 
Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes. 
You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, 
ki-rin, unicorn, or other entity that resides in the planes 
of everlasting bliss. Your pact with that being allows you 
to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illu-
minates the multiverse. 
Being connected to such power can cause changes in 
your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven 
to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect 
the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled 
with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, 
and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your 
days. But you know that your mission is among mortals 
for now, and that your pact binds you to bring light to the 
dark places of the world.

BONUS CANTRIPS 
At 1st level, you learn the light and sacred flame can-
trips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they 
don't count against your number of cantrips known. 
HEALING LIGHT 
At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial 
energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you 
s pend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the 
pool equals 1 + your warlock level. 
As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can 
see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. 
The maximum number of dice you can spend at once 
equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die).
