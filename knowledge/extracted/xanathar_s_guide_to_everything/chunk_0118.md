WAND OF CONDUCTING 
Wand, common

out to a range of 60 feet and ends when you stop wav-
ing the wand. 
The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. 
If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a

and is destroyed.

less burst of multicolored light at a point you can see 
up to 60 feet away. The burst of light is accompanied 
by a crackJing noise that can be heard up to 300 feet 
away. The light is as bright as a torch flame but lasts 
only a second. 
The wand regains l d6 + 1 expended charges daily at

CREATING ADDITIONAL COMMON ITEMS 
The "Special Features" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon 
Master's Guide is useful if you want to design other com-
mon magic items. For example, the What Minor Property 
Does It Have? table might inspire you to create a magic 
item that allows a character to speak and understand the 
Goblin language (based on the table's Language property), 
a magic item that glows in the presence of fiends (based 
on the Sentinel property), or a magic item that projects 
its user's voice over a great distance (based on the Wa r 
Leader property). 
CHAPTER 2 I DUNCEON MASTER'S TOOLS 
MAGIC ITEM TABLES

the Dungeon Master's Guide and the new items pre-
sented here into minor items and major items, then sep-
arate the items in each group according to rarity. Each 
table entry includes the item's type and an indication of 
whether the item requires attunement. Artifacts aren't 
included here; they are beyond even major items in
