PALADIN 
THE TRUE WORTH OF A PALADIN IS MEASURED NOT IN 
foes defeated or dungeons plundered. It is measured in lives 
saved and hearts turned to the causes of mercy and justice. 
- lsteval 
A paladin is a living embodiment of an oath-a promise 
or a vow made manifest in the person of a holy warrior 
who has the skill and the determination to see the cause 
through to the end. Some paladins devote themselves 
expressly to protecting the innocent and spreading jus-
tice in the world, while others resolve to attain that goal 
by conquering those who stand defiant and bringing 
them under the rule of law. 
Although no paladin in the world could be described 
as typical, a number of them are narrow-minded 
do-gooders who refuse to tolerate even the smallest 
deviation from their own outlook. Paladins who take 
up the adventuring life, however, rarely remain so rigid 
in their attitudes-if only to keep from alienating their 
companions. 
You can flesh out your paladin character by using the 
suggestions below. It's important to keep in mind that 
most paladins aren't robots. They have doubts and prej-
udices and harbor contradictory thoughts just as any 
other character does. Some are compelled by an inter-
nal motivation that might sometimes be at odds with the 
principles of their oaths. 
PERSONAL GOAL 
The precepts of a paladin's oath provide purpose to the 
character and dictate an ultimate goal or an overall in-
tent that the paladin abides by and advances. Aside from 
that, some paladins are driven by a personal goal that 
either complements or transcends the dictates of their 
oaths. Paladins who swear different oaths might have 
the same personal goal, differing only in how they apply 
that goal to their actions when upholding their oaths. 
If your paladin character has a personal goal, it might 
be drawn from some life event and thus not directly tied 
to the oath.

Glory. You will lead the world into a grand new era, 
one that will be branded with your name. 
SYMBOL 
Paladins are mindful of the influence of symbols, and 
many of them adopt or design an artistic device that 
bears a distinctive image. Your symbol exemplifies the 
oath you have taken and communicates that message to 
those around you, friend and foe alike. 
Your symbol might be displayed on a banner, a flag, or 
your clothing for all to see. Or it could be less obvious, 
such as a trinket or a token that you carry concealed on 
your person.

NEMESIS 
Their adherence to a sacred oath demands that paladins 
take an active stance in carrying their beliefs into the 
world. This activity naturally leads to conflict with crea-
tures or entities that oppose those beliefs. Among those 
opponents, one often stands out as a paladin's most per-
sistent or most form idable foe- a nemesis whose pres-
ence or influence is a constant factor in a paladin's life.
