Each of these sections has a table that offers possible 
complications. You can roll to determine a complication 
randomly, pick one from the table, or devise one of your 
own, and then share it with the player. 
EXAMPLE DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES 
----
The following activities are suitable for any character 
who can afford to pursue them. As OM, you have the 
final say on which activities are available to the char-
acters. The activities you allow might depend on the 
nature of the area where the characters are located. For 
example, you might disallow the creation of magic items 
or decide that the characters are in a town that is too 
isolated from major markets for them to buy such items. 
BUYING A MAGIC ITEM 
Purchasing a magic item requires time and money to 
seek out and contact people willing to sell items. Even 
then, there is no guarantee a seller will have the items a 
character desires. 
Resources. Finding magic items to purchase requires 
at least one workweek of effort and 100 gp in expenses. 
Spending more time and money increases your chance 
of finding a high-quality item. 
Resolution. A character seeking to buy a magic item 
makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine 
the quality of the seller found. The character gains a 
+l bonus on the check for every workweek beyond the 
first that is spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for 
every additional 100 gp spent on the search, up to a 
maximum bonus of +10. The monetary cost includes 
a wealthy lifestyle, for a buyer must impress potential 
business partners. 
As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of 
the check dictates which table in the Dungeon Master's 
Guide to roll on to determine which items are on the 
market. Or you can roll for items from any table associ-
ated with a lower total on the Buying Magic Items table. 
As a further option to reflect the availability of items 
in your campaign, you can apply a -10 penalty for low 
magic campaigns or a +10 bonus for high magic cam-
paigns. Furthermore, you can double magic item costs 
in low magic campaigns. 
Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign 
prices to the available items, based on their rarity. 
Halve the price of a ny consumable item, such as a po-
tion or a scroll, when using the table to determine a n 
asking price. 
You have final say in determining which items are for 
sale and their final price, no matter what the tables say. 
If the characters seek a specific magic item, first 
decide if it's an item you want to allow in your game. If 
so, include the desired item among the items for sale 
on a check total of 10 or higher if the item is common, 
15 or higher if it is uncommon, 20 or higher if it is rare, 
25 or higher if it is very rare, and 30 or higher if it is 
legendary.

Complications. The magic item trade is fraught with 
peril. The large sums of money involved and the power 
offered by magic items attract thieves, con a rtists, and 
other villains. If you want to make things more interest-
ing for the characters, roll on the Magic Item Purchase 
Complications table or invent your own complication.

CAROUSING 
Carousing is a default downtime activity for many char-
acters. Between adventures, who doesn't want to relax 
with a few drinks and a group of friends at a tavern? 
Resources. Carousing covers a workweek of fine 
food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can at-
tempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class 
folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 
10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class.
