d6 
I became a warlock because ... 
3 
I stumbled into the clutches of my patron after I ac-
cidentally stepped through a magical doorway. 
4 
When I was faced with a terrible crisis, I prayed to 
any being who would listen, and the creature that 
answered became my patron. 
5 
My future patron visited me in my dreams and of-
fered great power in exchange for my service. 
6 
One of my ancestors had a pact with my patron, so 
that entity was determined to bind me to the same 
agreement.

An old wizard chose me from among several candi-
dates to serve an apprenticeship. 
When I became lost in a forest, a hedge wizard 
found me, took me in, and taught me the rudi-
ments of magic. 
I grew up listening to tales of great wizards and 
knew I wanted to follow their path. I strove to be 
accepted at an academy of magic and succeeded. 
One of my relatives was an accomplished wizard 
who decided I was smart enough to learn the craft. 
While exploring an old tomb, libra ry, or tem ple, 
I found a spellbook. I was immediately driven to 
learn all I could about becoming a wizard. 
I was a prodigy who demonstrated mastery of the 
arcane arts at an early age. When I became old 
enough to set out on my own, I did so to learn 
more magic and expand my power. 
LIFE EVENTS 
No matter how long you've been alive, you have expe-
rienced at least one signature event that has markedly 
influenced your character. Life events include wondrous 
happenings and tragedies, conflicts and successes, and 
encounters with the unusual. They can help to explain 
why your character became a n adventurer, and some 
might sWI affect your life even after they are long over. 
The older a character is, the greater the chance for 
multiple life events, as shown on the Life Events by Age 
table. If you have a lready chosen your character's start-
ing age, see the entry in the Life Events column that 
corresponds to how old you are. Otherwise, you can roll 
dice to determine your curre nt age and number of life 
events randomly. 
After you know the number of life events your charac-
ter has experienced, roll once on the Life Events table 
for each of them. Many of the results on that table direct 
you to one of the secondary tables that follow. Once you 
have determined a ll of your character's life events, you 
can arrange them in any chronological order you see fit.
