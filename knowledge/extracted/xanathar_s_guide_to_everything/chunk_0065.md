Skill at carpentry enables a character to construct 
wooden structures. A carpenter can build a house, a 
shack, a wooden cabinet, or similar items. 
Components. Carpenter's tools include a saw, a ham-
mer, nails, a hatchet, a square, a ruler, an adze, a plane, 
and a chisel. 
History. This tool proficiency aids you in identifying 
the use and the origin of wooden buildings and other 
large wooden objects. 
Investigation. You gain additional insight when in-
specting areas within wooden structures, because you 
know tricks of construction that can conceal areas from 
discovery. 
Perception. You can spot irregularities in wooden 
walls or floors, making it easier to find trap doors and 
secret passages. 
Stealth. You can quickly assess the weak spots in a 
wooden floor, making it easier to avoid the places that 
creak and groan when they're stepped on. 
Fortify. With 1 minute of work and raw materials, 
you can make a door or window harder to force open. 
Increase the DC needed to open it by 5. 
Temporary Shelter. As part of a long rest, you can 
construct a lean-to or a similar s helter to keep your 
group dry and in the shade for the duration of the rest.

was available, the shelter collapses ld3 days after being 
assembled.

Using cartographer's tools, you can create accurate 
maps to make travel easier for yourself a nd those who 
come after you. These maps can range from large-scale 
depictions of mountain ranges to diagrams that show 
the layout of a dungeon level. 
Components. Cartographer's tools consist of a 
quill, ink, parchment, a pair of compasses, calipers, 
and a ruler. 
Arcana, History, Religion. You can use your knowl-
edge of maps and locations to unearth more detailed 
information when you use these skills. For instance, you 
might spot hidden messages in a map, identify when the 
map was made to determine if geographical features 
have changed since then, and so forth.

sues relating to the terrain around you. 
Survival. Your understanding of geography makes it 
easier to find paths to civilization, to predict areas where 
villages or towns might be found, and to avoid becom-
ing lost. You have studied so many maps that common 
patterns, such as how trade routes evolve and where 
settlements a rise in relation to geographic locations, are 
familiar to you.

visited by examining the wear a nd the dirt that has ac-
cumulated on their shoes. Your experience in repairing 
shoes makes it easier for you to identify where damage 
might come from. 
Maintain Shoes. As part of a long rest, you can repair 
your companions' shoes. For the next 24 hours, up to six 
creatures of your choice who wear shoes you worked on 
can travel up to 10 hours a day without making saving 
throws to avoid exhaustion.

you can add a hidden compartment to a pair of shoes.
