You know who your parents are or were.

You do not know who your parents were. 
Nonhuman Parents. If your character is a ha lf-elf, a 
half-ore, or a tiefling, you can use one of the tables below 
to determine the race of each of your parents. When you 
have a result, randomly determine which part of the re-
sult refers to your father and which to your mother.

B IRTHPLACE 
After establishing your parentage, you can determine 
where you were born by using the Birthplace table. 
(Modify the result or roll again if you get a result that's 
inconsistent with what you know about your parents.) 
Once you have a result, roll percentile dice. On a roll of 
00, a strange event coincided with your birth: the moon 
briefly turning red, all the milk within a mile spoiling, 
the water in the area freezing solid in midsummer, all 
the iron in the home rusting or turning to silver, or some 
other unusual event of your choice.

SIBLINGS 
You might be an only child or one of many children. 
Your siblings could be cherished friends or hated rivals. 
Roll on the Number of Siblings table to determine how 
many brothers or sisters you have. If you are a dwarf or 
an elf, subtract 2 from your roll. Then, roll on the Birth 
Order table for each sibling to determine that person's 
age relative to yours (older, younger, or born at the 
same time). 
Occupation. For each sibling of suitable age, roll on 
the Occupation supplemental table to determine what 
that person does for a living. 
Alignment. You can choose your siblings' alignments 
or roll on the Alignment supplemental table. 
S tatus. By now, each of your siblings might be alive 
and well, alive and not so well, in dire straits, or dead. 
Roll on the Status supplemental table. 
Relationship. You can roll on the Relationship sup-
plemental table to determine how your siblings feel 
about you. They might all have the same attitude toward 
you, or some might view you differently from how the 
others do. 
Other Details. You can decide any other details you 
like about each sibling, including gender, personality, 
and place in the world.
