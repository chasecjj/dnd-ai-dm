You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see 
within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You ma-
njpulate it in one of the following ways: 
• If you target an area of loose earth, you can instan-
taneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and 
deposit it up to 5 feet away. Trus movement doesn't 
involve enough force to cause damage. 
• You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt 
or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shap-
ing patterns. The changes last for 1 hour. 
• If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you 
cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you 
can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is 
already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour. 
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no 
more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at 
a time, and you can dismiss s uch an effect as an action. 
NEGATIVE ENERGY FLOOD 
5th-level necromancy 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, M (a broken bone and a square of 
black s ilk) 
Duration: Instantaneous 
You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you 
can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it 
mus t make a Constitution saving throw, taking Sd12 ne-
crotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises 
up as a zombie at the start of your next turn. T he zombie 
pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. 
Statistics for the zombie are in the Monster Manual. 
If you target an undead with th is spell, the target 
doesn't make a saving throw. Instead, roll Sdl2. The tar-
get gains half the total as temporary hit points. 
POWER WORD PAIN 
7th-level enchantment 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 
You speak a word of power that causes waves of intense 
pain to assail one creature you can see within range. 
If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject 
to crippling pain. Otherwise, the spell has no effect 
on it. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to be-
ing charmed. 
While the target is affected by crippling pain, any 
speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target 
also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and 
saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. 
Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first suc-
ceed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails 
and the spell is wasted. 
A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a suc-
cessful save, the pain ends.

Range: Self 
Components: S 
Duration: Instantaneous

gernails to s harpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack.

feet of you. On a hit, the target takes ldlO acid damage . 
After you make the attack, your teeth or fingernails re-
turn to normal. 
The spell's damage increases by ldlO when you reach 
5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). 
PRIMORDIAL WARD 
6th-level abjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and 
thunder damage for the spell's duration. 
When you take damage of one of those types, you can 
use your reaction to gain immunity to that type of dam-
age, including against the triggering damage. If you do 
so, the resistances end, and you have the immuruty until 
the end of your next turn, at which time the spell ends. 
PSYCHIC SCREAM 
9th-level enchantment 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Components: S 
Duration: Instantaneous 
You unleash the power of your mind to blast the intellect 
of up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see 
within range. Creatures that have an Intelligence score 
of 2 or lower are unaffected. 
Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. 
On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 psychic damage 
and is stunned. On a successful save, a target takes half 
as much damage and isn't stunned. If a target is killed 
by this damage, its head explodes, assuming it has one. 
A stunned target can make an Intelligence saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful 
save, the stunning effect ends.
