Patience. Change takes time. Those who have walked 
the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep 
them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of 
righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day 
to a llow that seed to survive and flourish. 
Wisdom. Your heart a nd mind must stay clear, for 
eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While ev-
ery creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the 
path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives 
for the greater good. Any s uch action must be carefully 
weighed and the consequences fully understood, but 
once you have made the decision, follow through with it 
knowing your path is just.

CHANNEL DIVINITY 
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the follow-
ing two Channel Divinity options. 
Emissary of Peace. You can use your Channel Divin-
ity to augment your presence with divine power. As a 
bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Charisma 
(Persuasion) checks for the next 10 minutes. 
Rebuke the Violent. You can use your Channel Divin-
ity to rebuke those who use violence. Immediately after 
an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an 
attack against a creature other than you, you can use 
your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant 
damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a success-
ful save, it takes half as much damage. 
AURA OF THE GUARDIAN 
PALADIN OF 
REDEMPTION 
Starting at 7th level, you can shield others from harm at 
the cost of your own health. When a creature within 10 
feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to 
magically take that damage, instead of that creature tak-
ing it. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that 
might accompany the da mage, and this damage can't be 
reduced in any way. 
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases 
to 30 feet. 
PROTECTIVE SPIRIT 
Starting at 15th level, a holy presence mends your 
wounds in battle. You regain hit points equal to ld6 + 
half your paladin level if you end your turn in combat 
with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and 
you aren't incapacitated. 
EMISSARY OF REDEMPTION 
At 20th level, you become an avatar of peace, which 
gives you two benefits: 
• You have resistance to all damage dealt by other crea-
tures (their attacks, spells, and other effects). 
• Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes 
radiant damage equal to half the damage you take 
from the attack. 
If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal dam-
age to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit 
works against that creature until you finish a long rest.
