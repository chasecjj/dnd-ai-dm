RANGER 
I SPEND A LOT OF MY LIFE AWAY FROM CfVlLIZATION, 
keeping to its fringes to protect it. Don't assume that be-
cause I don't bend the knee to your king that I haven't done 
more to protect him than all his knights put together. 
-Soveliss 
Rangers are free-minded wanderers and seekers who 
patrol the edges of civilized territory, turning back the 
denizens of the wild lands beyond. It is a thankless job, 
since their efforts are rarely understood and almost 
never rewarded. Yet rangers persist in their duties, 
never doubting that their work makes the world a 
safer place. 
A relationship with civilization informs every ranger's 
persona lity and history. Some rangers see themselves 
as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on civili-
zation's frontier, answering to no sovereign power. Oth-
ers are survivalists who eschew civilization a ltogether. 
They vanquish monsters to keep themselves safe while 
they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of 
the world. If their efforts also benefit the kingdoms a nd 
other civilized realms that they avoid, so be it. 
If you're creating or playing a ranger character, the 
following sections offer ideas for embellishing the char-
acter and enhancing your roleplaying experience. 
VIEW OF THE WORLD 
A ranger's view of the world begins (and sometimes 
ends) with that character's outlook toward civilized folk 
and the places they occupy. Some rangers have a n atti-
tude toward civilization that's deeply rooted in disdain, 
while others pity the people they have sworn to pro-
tect- though on the battlefield, it's impossible to tell the 
difference between one ranger and another. Indeed, to 
those who have seen them operate and been the benefi-
ciaries of their prowess, it scarcely matters why rangers 
do what they do. That said, no two rangers are likely to 
express their opinions on any matter in the same way. 
If you haven't yet thought about the details of your 
character's worldview, consider putting a finer point on 
things by summarizing that viewpoint in a short state-
ment (such as the entries on the following table). How 
might that feeling affect the way you conduct yourself?

VIEWS OF THE WORLD 
d6 
View 
Towns and cities are the best places for those who 
can't survive on their own. 
2 
The advancement of civilization is the best way to 
thwart chaos, but its reach must be monitored. 
3 
Towns and cities are a necessary evil, but once the 
wilderness is purged of supernatural threats, we 
will need them no more. 
4 
Walls are for cowards, who huddle behind them 
while others do the work of making the world safe. 
S 
Visiting a town is not unpleasant, but after a few 
days I feel the irresistible call to return to the wild. 
6 
Cities breed weakness by isolating folk from the 
harsh lessons of the wild. 
HOMELAND 
All rangers, regardless of how they came to take up 
the profession, have a strong connection to the natural 
world and its various terrains. For some rangers, the 
wilderness is where they grew up, either as a result of 
being born there or moving there at a young age. For 
other ra ngers, civilization was originally home, but the 
wilderness became a second homeland. 
Think of your character's backstory and decide what 
terrain feels most like home, whether or not you were 
born there. What does that terrain say about your per-
sona lity? Does it influence which spells you choose to 
learn? Have your experiences there shaped who your 
favored enemies a re? 
HOMELANDS 
d6 
Homeland 
You patrolled an ancient forest, darkened and cor-
rupted by several crossings to the Shadowfell. 
2 
As part of a group of nomads, you acquired the 
skills for surviving in the desert. 
3 
Your early life in the Underdark prepared you for 
the challenges of combating its denizens. 
4 
You dwelled on the edge of a swamp, in an area im-
periled by land creatures as well as aquatic ones. 
S 
Because you grew up among the peaks, finding the 
best path through the mountains is second nature 
to you. 
6 
You wandered the far north, learning how to pro-
tect yourself and prosper in a realm overrun by ice.
