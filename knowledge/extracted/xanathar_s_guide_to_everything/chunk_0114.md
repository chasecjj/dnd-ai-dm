3. Choose a magic item of any rarity for which the entry 
in this row is not 0. 
4. When the characters obtain an item, modify your 
notes to indicate which part of your budget this expen-
diture came from by subtracting 1 from the appropri-
ate entry on the table. 
In the future, if you choose an item of a rarity that's 
not available in the current tier but is still available in 
a lower tier, deduct the item from the lower tier. If all 
lower tiers also have no items available of a given rarity, 
deduct the item from a higher tier. 
CHOOSING ITEMS PIECEMEA L 
If you prefer a more free-form method of choosing magic 
items, simply select each magic item you want to give 
out; then, when the characters acquire one, deduct it 
from the M agic Items Awarded by R arity table in your 
notes. Whenever you do so, start with the lowest tier, 
and deduct the item from the first number you come 
across in the appropriate rarity column for the item , 
whether its minor or major. If that tier doesn't have a 
number greater than 0 for that rarity, go up a tier until 
you find one that does, and deduct the magic item from 
that number. Following this process, you will zero out 
each row of the table in order, going from the lowest lev-
els to the highest. 
O VERSTOCKING AN ADVENTURE 
The magic item tables in this section are based on the 
number of items the characters are expected to receive, 
not the number of items that are available in an adven-
ture. When creating or modifying an adventure, assume 
that the characters won't find all the items you place in 
it, unless most of the loot is in easy-to-find locations. 
H ere's a good ru le of thumb: an adventure can include a 
number of items that's 25 percent higher than the num-
bers in the tables (round up). For example, an adventure 
designed to take characters from 1st to 4th level might 
include fourteen items rather than eleven, in the expec-
tation that three of those items won't be found. 
ARE M ACIC ITEMS NECESSARY I N A CAMPAIG N ? 
The D&D game is built on the assumption that magic 
items appear sporadically and that they are always a boon, 
unless an item bears a curse. Characters and monsters are 
built to face each other without the help of magic items, 
which means that having a magic item always makes a 
character more powerful or versatile than a generic char-
acter of the same level. As DM, you never have to worry 
about awarding magic items just so the characters can 
keep up with the campaign's threats. Magic items are truly 
prizes. Are they useful? Absolutely. Are they necessary? No. 
Magic items can go from nice to necessary in the rare 
group that has no spellcasters, no monk, and no N PCs 
capable of casting magic weapon. Having no magic makes 
it extremely difficult for a party to overcome monsters that 
have resistances or immunity to nonmagical damage. In 
such a game, you'll want to be generous with magic weap-
ons or else avoid usi ng such monsters. 
CHAPTER 2 I DUKGEON MASTER'S TOOLS 
COMMON MAGIC ITEMS 
The Dungeon Master's Guide includes many magic 
items of every rarity. The one exception are common 
items; that book includes few of them. This section intro-
duces more of them to the game. These items seldom in-
crease a character's power, but they are likely to amuse 
players and provide fun roleplaying opportunities. 
The magic items are presented in alphabetical order. 
ARMOR OF GLEAMING 
Armor (any m edium or heavy), common 
This armor never gets dirty. 
BEAD OF NOURISHMENT 
Wondrous item, common 
This spongy, flavorless, gelatinous bead dissolves on 
your tongue and provides as much nourishment as 1 day 
of rations. 
BEAD OF REFRESHMENT 
Wondrous item, common 
This spongy, flavorless, gelatinous bead dissolves in 
liquid, transforming up to a pint of the liquid into fresh, 
cold drinking water. The bead has no effect on magical 
liquids or harmful substances such as poison. 
B OOT S OF FALSE TRACKS 
Wondrous item, common 
Only humanoids can wear these boots. While wearing 
the boots, you can choose to have them leave tracks like 
those of another kind of humanoid of your size. 
CANDLE OF THE DEEP 
Wondrous item, common 
The flame of this candle is not extinguished when 
immersed in water. lt gives off light and heat like a nor-
mal candle. 
CAST-OFF ARMOR 
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), common 
You can doff this armor as an action. 
CHARLATAN'S DIE 
Wondrous item, common (requires attunement) 
Whenever you roll this six-sided die, you can control 
which number it rolls. 
CLOAK OF BILLOWING 
Wondrous item, common 
While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to 
make it billow dramatically. 
CLOAK OF MANY FASHIONS 
Wondrous item, common 
While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to 
change the style, color, and apparent quality of the gar-
ment. The cloak's weight doesn't change. Regardless of 
its appearance, the cloak can't be anything but a cloak. 
Although it can duplicate the appearance of other magic 
cloaks, it doesn't gain their magical properties.
