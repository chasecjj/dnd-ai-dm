PIT FIGHTING 
Pit fighting includes boxing, wrestling, and other nonle-
thal forms of combat in an organized setting with prede-
ter mined matches. If you want to introduce competitive 
fighting in a battle-to-the-death situation, the standard 
combat rules apply to that sort of activity. 
Resources. Engaging in this activity requires one 
workweek of effort from a character. 
Resolution. The character must make a series of 
checks, with a DC determined at random based on the 
quality of the opposition that the character runs into. 
A big part of the challenge in pit fighting lies in the un-
known nature of a character's opponents. 
The character makes three checks: Strength (Athlet-
ics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), and a special Constitution 
check that has a bonus equal to a roll of the character's 
largest Hit Die (this roll doesn't spend that die). ff de-
sired, the character can replace one of these skill checks 
with an attack roll using one of the character's weapons. 
The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a 
separate DC for each one. ConsuJt the Pit Fighting Re-
sults table to see how the character did.

Complications. Characters involved in pit fighting 
must deal with their opponents, the people who bet on 
matches, and the matches' promoters. Every workweek 
spent pit fighting brings a 10 percent chance of a compli· 
cation, examples of which are on the P it Fighting Com-
plications table.

RELAXATION 
Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is 
relax. Whether a character wants a bard-earned vaca-
tion or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the 
ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This op· 
tion is also ideal for players who don't want to make use 
of the downtime system. 
Resources. Relaxation requires one week. A charac-
ter needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while 
relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity. 
Resolution. Characters who maintain at least a mod-
est lifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While 
relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws 
to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In 
addition, at the end of the week, a character can end one 
effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points, 
or can restore one ability score that has been reduced to 
less than its normal value. T his benefit cannot be used 
if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other 
magical effect with an ongoing duration. 
Complications. Relaxation rarely comes with com-
plications. I f you want to make life complicated for the 
characters, introduce an action or an event connected 
to a rival. 
RELIGIOUS SERVICE 
Characters with a religious bent might want to spend 
downtime in ser vice to a temple, either by attending 
rites or by prosely tizing in the community. Someone 
w ho undertakes this activity has a chance of winning 
the favor of the temple's leaders. 
Resources. Performing religious service requires ac-
cess to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs 
and etho~ align with the character's. If such a place is 
available, the activity takes one workweek of time but 
involves no gold piece expenditure. 
Resolution. At the end of the required time, the char-
acter chooses to make either an Intelligence (Religion) 
check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check. The total of 
the check determines the benefits of service, as shown 
on the Religious Service table.
