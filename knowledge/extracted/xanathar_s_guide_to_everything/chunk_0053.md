CLERIC 
d6 
I became a cleric because ... 
A supernatu ral being in service to the gods called 
me to become a divine agent in the world. 
2 
I saw the injustice and horror in the world and felt 
moved to take a stand against them. 
3 
My god gave me an unmistakable sign. I dropped 
everything to serve the divine. 
4 
Although I was always devout, it wasn't until I com-
pleted a pilgrimage that I knew my true calling. 
5 
I used to serve in my religion's bureaucracy but 
found I needed to work in the world, to bring the 
message of my faith to the darkest corners of the 
land. 
6 
I realize that my god works through me, and I do as 
commanded, even though I don't know why I was 
chosen to serve. 
DRUID 
d6 
I became a druid because ... 
I saw too much devastation in the wild places, too 
much of nature's splendor ruined by the despoil-
ers. I joined a circle of druids to fight back against 
the enemies of nature.

a catastrophe. 
I have always had an affin ity for animals, so I ex-
plored my talent to see how I cou ld best use it. 
I befriended a druid and was moved by druidic 
teachings. I decided to follow my friend's guidance 
and give something back to the world. 
While I was growing up, I saw spi rits all around 
me-
entities no one else could perceive. I sought 
out the druids to help me understand the visions 
and communicate with these beings. 
6 
I have a lways felt disgust for creatures of unnatural 
origin. For this reason, I immersed myself in the 
study of the druidic mysteries and became a cham-
pion of the natural order. 
FIGHTER 
d6 
I became a fighter because ... 
I wanted to hone my combat skills, and so I joined 
a war college. 
2 
I squired for a knight who taught me how to fight, 
care for a steed, and conduct myself with honor. I 
decided to take up that path for myself. 
3 
Horrible monsters descended on my community, 
killing someone I loved. I took up arms to destroy 
those creatures and others of a similar nature. 
4 
I joined the army and learned how to fight as part

of a group. 
I grew up fighting, and I refined my talents by de· 
fending myself against people who crossed me. 
I could always pick up just about any weapon and 
know how to use it effectively.

MONK 
d6 
I became a monk because ... 
I was chosen to study at a secluded monastery. 
There, I was taught the fundamental techniques 
required to eventually master a tradition. 
2 
I sought instruction to gain a deeper understand-
ing of existence and my place in the world. 
3 
I st~mbled into a portal to the Shadowfell and took 
refuge in a strange monastery, where I learned how 
to defend myself against the forces of darkness. 
4 
I was overwhelmed with grief after losing someone 
close to me, and I sought the advice of philoso-
phers to help me cope with my loss. 
5 
I could feel that a special sort of power lay within 
me, so I sought out those who could help me call it 
forth and master it. 
6 
I was wild and undisciplined as a youngster, but 
then I realized the error of my ways. I applied to a 
monastery and became a monk as a way to live a 
life of discipline.
