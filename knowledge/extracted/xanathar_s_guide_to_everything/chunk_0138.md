In addition, the sensors created by divination spells 
can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within 
can't be targeted by divination spells. 
Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains 
hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature 
regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom mod-
ifier (minimum 1 hit point). 
The temple is made from opaque magical force that 
extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal 
travel into the temple's interior. Nothing can physically 
pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled 
by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A 
disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly. 
Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a 
year makes this effect permanent.
