MONK 
DO NOT MISTAKE MY SILENCE FOR ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR 
villainy. While you blustered and threatened, I've planned 
four different ways to snap your neck with my bare hands. 
-Ember, grand master of flowers 
Monks walk a path of contradiction. They study their art 
as a wizard does, and like a wizard, they wear no armor 
and typically eschew weapons. Yet they are deadly com-
batants, their abilities on a par with those of a raging 
barba rian or a superbly trained fighter. Monks embrace 
this seeming contradiction, for it speaks to the core of 
all monastic study. By coming to know oneself com-
pletely, one learns much of the wider world. 
A monk's focus on inner mastery leads many such 
individuals to become detached from society, more con-
cerned with their personal experience tha n with hap-
penings elsewhere. Adventuring monks are a rare breed 
of an a lready rare type of character, taking their quest 
for perfection beyond the walls of the monastery into the 
world at large. 
Playing a monk character offers many intriguing op-
portunities to try something different. To distinguish 
your monk character even further, consider the options 
in the sections that follow. 
MONASTERY 
A monk studies in a monastery in preparation for a life 
of asceticism. Most of those who enter a monastery 
make it their home for the rest of their lives, with the 
exception of adventurers and others who have reason to 
leave. For those individuals, a monastery might serve as 
a refuge between excursions to the world or as a source 
of support in times of need. 
What sort of place was your monastery, and where is 
it located? Did attending it contr ibute to your experience 
in an unus ual or distinctive way?

MONASTIC ICON 
Even in the monastic lifestyle , which eschews materi-
alism and personal possessions, symbolism plays an 
important part in defining the identity of an order. Some 
monastic orders treat certain creatures with special 
regard, either because the creature is tied to the order's 
history or because it serves as an example of a quality 
the monks seek to emulate. 
If your cha racter's monastery had a special icon, you 
might wear a crude image of the creature somewhere 
inconspicuous on your clothing to serve as an identify-
ing mark. Or perhaps your order's icon does not have a 
physical form but is expressed through a gesture or a 
posture that you adopt, and which other monks might 
know how to interpret. 
MONASTIC ICONS
