CHAPTER 1 I CHARACTER OPTIONS 
CIRCLE OF MORTALITY 
At 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate the line 
betw een life and death. When you would normally roll 
one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to 
a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest 
number possible for each die. 
In addition, you learn the spare the dying cantrip, 
which doesn't count against the number of cleric can-
trips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and 
you can cast it a~ a bonus action. 
EYES OF THE GRAVE 
At 1st level, you gain the ability to occasionally sense the 
presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to 
the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your 
awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end 
of your next turn, you know the location of any undead 
within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and 
that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense 
doesn't tell you anything about a creature's capabilities 
or identity. 
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 
your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain 
all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
CHANNEL DIVINITY: PATH TO THE GRAVE 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel D ivinity 
to mark another creature's life force for termination. 
As an action, you choose one creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your 
next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits 
the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has 
vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the 
curse ends. 
SENTINEL AT DEATH 'S DOOR 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death's prog-
ress. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn 
that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a criti-
cal hit are canceled. 
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 
your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain 
all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
POTENT SPELLCASTING 
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to 
the damage you deal with any cleric can trip. 
KEEPER OF SOULS 
Starting at 17th level, you can seize a trace of vitality 
from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When 
an enemy you can see dies within 60 feet of you, you or 
one creature of your choice that is within 60 feet of you 
regains hit points equal to the enemy's number of H it 
Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren't incapac-
itated. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the 
start of your next turn.
