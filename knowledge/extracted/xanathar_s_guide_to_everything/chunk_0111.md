truthful, and a rival with a scholarly bent might try to 
lead the character astray, especially if the object of the 
research is known to the rival. The rival might plant 
false information, bribe sages to give bad advice, or steal 
key tomes needed to find the truth. 
In addition, a character might run into other com-
plications during research. Every workweek spent in 
research brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, 
examples of which are on the Research Complica-
tions table.

SCRIBING A SPELL SCROLL 
With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a 
spell to a scroll, creating a spell scroll. 
Resources. Scribing a spell scroll takes an amount of 
time and money related to the level of the spell the char-
acter wants to scribe, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs 
table. In addition, the character must have proficiency 
in the Arcana skill and must provide any material com-
ponents required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, 
the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be 
among the character's known spells, in order to scribe a 
scroll of that spell. 
If the scribed spell is a can trip, the version on the 
scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

Complications. Crafting a spelf scroll is a solitary 
task, unlikely to attract much attention. The complica-
tions that arise are more likely to involve the preparation 
needed for the activity. Every workweek spent scribing 
brings a 10 percent cha nce of a complication, examples 
of which are on the Scribe a Scroll Complications table.

a barely visible map on it.

SELLING A MAGIC ITEM 
Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con 
artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy 
score, and there's no guarantee that a character will re-
ceive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found. 
R esources. A character can find a buyer for one 
magic item by spending one workweek and 25 gp, which 
is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character 
mus t pick one item at a time to sell. 
Resolution. A character who wants to sell an item 
must make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine 
what kind of offer comes in. The character can always 
opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort 
and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices 
and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price.

Complications. T he main risk in selling a magic item 
lies in attracting thieves and anyone else who wants the 
item but doesn't want to pay for it. Other folk might try to 
undermine a deal in order to bolster their own business 
or seek to discredit the character as a legitimate seller. 
Every workweek spent trying to sell an item brings a 10 
percent chance of a complication, examples of which are 
on the Magic Item Sale Complications table.
