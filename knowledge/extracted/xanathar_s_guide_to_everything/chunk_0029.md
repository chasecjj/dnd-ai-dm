Your paladin character might have an enemy that 
dates from the days before you took up your path. Or you 
could be a target because when you became a paladin, 
you immediately attracted the attention of those that 
would do you in. If you have a nemesis, who or what is 
it? Whom among your enemies do you consider to be the 
biggest threat to achieving your goals? 
NEMESES 
d6 
Nemesis 
A mighty ore war chief who threatens to overrun 
and destroy everything you hold sacred 
2 
A fiend or a celestial, the agent of a power of the 
Outer Planes, who has been charged with corrupt-
ing or redeeming you, as appropriate 
3 
A dragon whose servants dog your steps 
4 
A high priest who sees you as a misguided fool and 
wants you to abandon your religion 
5 
A rival paladin who trained with you but became an 
oath-breaker and holds you responsible 
6 
A vampire who has sworn revenge against all pala-
dins after being defeated by one 
TEMPTATION 
Although paladins are dedicated to their oaths, they are 
mortals, and thus they are flawed. Many of them exhibit 
a type of behavior or hold to an attitude that is not in 
keeping with the highest ideals of their calling. 
What is the temptation that your character succumbs 
to or finds it difficult to resist? 
TEMPTATIONS 
d6 
Temptation 
Fury. When your anger is roused, you have trouble 
thinking straight, and you fear you might do some-
thing you'll regret. 
2 
Pride. Your deeds are noteworthy, and no one takes 
note of them more often than you. 
3 
Lust. You can't resist an attractive face and a pleas-
ant smile. 
4 
Envy. You are mindful of what some famous folk 
have accomplished, and you feel inadequate when 
your deeds don't compare to theirs. 
5 
Despair. You consider the great strength of the 
enemies you must defeat, and at times you see no 
way to achieve final victory. 
6 
Greed. Regardless of how much glory and treasure 
you amass, it's never enough for you. 
SACRED OATHS 
At 3rd level, a paladin gains the Sacred Oath feature. 
The following options are available to a paladin, in addi-
tion to those offered in the Player's Handbook: the Oath 
of Conquest and the Oath of Redemption. 
PALl\OIN OF CoNQ.uE s T 
OATH OF CONQU_E_S_T ___ 
_ 
The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory 
in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn't 
enough for these paladins to establish order. They must 
crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight ty-
rants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather 
into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war 
and well-ordered might. 
Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with 
the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law 
over the balm of mercy. The arcbdevil Bel, warlord of 
Avernus, counts many of these paladins- called hell 
knights- as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights 
cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen en-
emies, a grim-warning to any who dare oppose them 
and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often 
most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, 
who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far 
into darkness. 
TENETS OF CONQUEST 
A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest 
seared on the upper arm. 
Douse the Flame of Hope. It is not enough to merely 
defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so over-
whelming that your enemies' will to fight is shattered 
forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire. 
Rule with an Iron Fist. Once you have conquered, 
tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it
