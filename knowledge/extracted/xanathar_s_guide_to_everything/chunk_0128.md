tinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can 
see as enemies until the spell ends. Each time the target 
takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the 
effect on itself on a success. 
Whenever the affected creature chooses another 
creature as a target, it must choose the target at random 
from among the creatures it can see within range of the

deal 4d8 necrotic damage to the target. The spell ends 
if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is

gain hit points equal to ha lf the amount of necrotic dam-
