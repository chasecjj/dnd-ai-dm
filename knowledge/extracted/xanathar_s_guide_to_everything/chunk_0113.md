AWARDING MAGIC ITEMS 
Magic items are prized by D&D adventurers of a ll sorts 
and are often the main reward in an adventure. The 
rules for magic items are presented, along w ith the 
Treasure Hoard tables, in chapter 7 of the Dungeon 
Master's Guide. This section expands on those rules by 
offering you an alternative way of determining which 
magic items end up in the characters' possession and by 
adding a collection of common magic items to the game. 
The section ends with tables that group magic items ac-
cording to rarity. 
The system in the Dungeon Master's Guide is de-
s igned so that you can generate a ll treasure randomly, 
and the tables also govern the number of magic items 
the cha racters receive. In short, the tables do the work. 
But a DM who's designing or modifying a n adventure 
might prefer to choose the magic items that come into 
play. If you're in that s ituation, you can use the rules in 
this section to personalize your treasure hoards while 
staying within the game's limits for how many items the 
characters s hould ultimately accumulate. 
DISTRIBUTION BY RARITY 
This a lternative method of treasure determination fo-
cuses on choosing magic items based on their rarity, 
rather than by rolling on the tables in the Dungeon Mas-
ter's Guide. This method uses two tables: Magic Items 
Awarded by Tier a nd Magic Items Awarded by Rarity. 
By Tier. The Magic Items Awarded by Tier table 
shows the number of magic items a D&D party typically 
gains during a campaign, culminating in the group's 
having accumulated one hundred magic items by 20th 
level. T he table shows how many of those items are 
meant to be handed out during each of the four tiers of 
play. The emphasis on characters receiving more items 
during the second tier (levels 5- 10) than in other tiers 
is by design. The second tier is where much of the play 
occurs in a typical D&D campaign, and the items gained 
in that tier prepare the characters for higher-level 
adventures. 
By Rarity. The Magic Items Awarded by Rarity table 
takes the numbers from the Magic Items Awarded by 
Tier table and breaks them down to show the number of 
items of each rarity the characters are expected to have 
when they reach the end of a tier. 
Minor and Major Items. Both tables in this section 
make a distinction between minor magic items and ma-
jor magic items. This distinction exists in the Dungeon 
Master's Guide, yet those terms aren't used there. In 
that book, the minor items are those listed on Magic 
Item Tables A through E, and the major items are on 
MAGIC ITEMS AWARDED BY RARITY 
BEHIND THE DESIGN: MAGIC ITEM DISTRIBUTION 
The Dungeon Master's Guide assumes a certain amount of 
treasure will be found over the course of a campaign. Over 
twenty levels of typical play, the game expects forty-five 
rolls on the Treasure Hoard tables, distributed as follows: 
• Seven rolls on the Challenge 0-4 table 
• Eighteen rolls on the Challenge 5-10 table 
• Twelve rolls on the Challenge 11-16 table 
• Eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table 
Because many of the table results call for more than one 
magic item, those forty-five rolls will result in the charac-
ters obtaining roughly one hundred items. The optional 
system described here yields the same number of items, 
distributed properly throughout the spectrum of rarity, 
while enabling you to control exactly which items the char-
acters have a chance of acquiring. 
Magic Item Tables F through I. As you can see from the 
Treasure Hoard tables in that book, major magic items 
are meant to be handed out much less frequently than 
minor items, even at higher levels of play.

CHOOSING ITEMS LEVEL BY LEVEL 
You decide when to place an item in an adventure that 
you're creating or modifying, usually because you think 
the story calls for a magic item, the characters need one, 
or the players would be especially pleased to get one. 
When you want to select an item as treasure for an en-
counter, the Magic Items Awarded by Rarity table serves 
as your item budget. Here's how to use it: 
1. jot down a copy of the table in your notes, so that you 
can make adjustments to the numbers as you select 
items to be placed in an adventure. 
2. Refer to the line in the Level/CR column that corre-
sponds to one of the following values (your choice): 
the level of the player characters, the challenge rating 
of the magic item's owner, or the challenge rating of 
the group of creatures guarding the item. The entries 
in that row of the table indicate the total number of 
items that would be appropriate for the characters to 
receive by the end of the tier represented by that row.
