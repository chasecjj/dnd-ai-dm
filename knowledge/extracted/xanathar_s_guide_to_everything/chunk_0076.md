RANDOM ENCOUNTERS: 
A WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES 
Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide provides guid-
ance on using random encounters in your game. This 
section builds on that guidance, offering a host of ran-
dom encounter tables for you to use when you determine 
that a random encounter is going to take place. 
Using the monster lists in appendix B of that book as 
a basis, we've built a set of tables for each environment 
category: arctic, coastal, desert, forest, grassla nd, hill, 
mounta in, swamp, Underdark, underwater, a nd urba n. 
Within each category, separate tables are provided for 
each of the four tiers of play: levels 1- 4, 5- 10, 11- 16, 
and 17-20. 
Even though you can use these tables "out of the box," 
the advice in the Dungeon Master's Guide still holds 
true: tailoring such tables to your ga me can reinforce 
the themes and flavor of your campaign. We encourage 
you to customize this material to ma ke it your own. 
In the tables, a name in bold refers to a stat block in 
the Monster Manual. 
FLIGHT, OR FIGHT, OR 
? 
Each of the results on these tables represents a certain 
kind of challenge or potentiaJ cha llenge. 
If you let the dice have their way a nd the result is a 
large number of monsters, the generated encounter 
might be too difficult or dangerous for the characters in 
their present circumstances. They might wa nt to flee to 
avoid contact, or not to approach any closer after per-
ceiving the monsters from a distance. 
Of course, you also have the freedom to adjust the 
numbers, but it's important to remember that not every 
encounter involving a monster needs to result in combat. 
An encounter might indeed be the prelude to a battle, 
a parley, or some other interaction. What happens next 
depends on what the characters try, or what you decide 
is bound to occur. 
The tables also include entries for what the Dungeon 
Master's Guide calls "encounters of a less monstrous 
nature." Many of these results cry out to be customized 
or detailed, which offers you a n opportunity to connect 
them to the story of your campaign. And in so doing, 
you've taken a step toward making your own persona l-
ized encounter table. Now, keep going!
