RAGING STORM 
At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows 
mightier, lashing out at your foes. T he effect is based on 
the environment you chose for your Storm Aura. 
Desert. Immediately after a creature in your aura nits 
you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force 
that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a 
failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half 
your barbarian level. 
Sea. When you hit a creature in your aura with an 
attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature 
to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the 
creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave. 
Tundra. Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is ac-
tivated, you can choose one creature you can see in the 
aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving 
throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your 
next turn, as magical frost covers it. 
PATH OF THE ZEALOT 
Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves 
into a ferocious battle fury. T hese barbarians are zeal-
ots- warriors who channel their rage into powerful dis-
plays of divine power. 
A variety of gods across the worlds of D&D inspire 
their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the 
Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Grey-
hawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who 
inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and 
violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.

DIVINE FURY 
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can 
channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While 
you're raging, the first creature you hit on each of your 
turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equa l 
to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is 
necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when 
you gain this feature. 
WARRIOR OF THE Goos 
At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a 
spell, s uch as raise dead, has the sole effect of restoring 
you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need ma-
terial components to cast the spell on you. 
FANATICAL Focus 
Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your 
rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while 
you're raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the 
new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage. 
ZEALOUS PRESENCE 
At 10th level, you learn to channel divine power to in-
s pire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash 
a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other 
creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can 
hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving 
throws until the start of your next turn. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 
RAGE BEYOND DEATH 
Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your 
rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows. 
While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock 
you unconscious. You still must make death saving 
throws, and you s uffer the normal effects of taking 
damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die 
due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until 
your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 
hit points.
