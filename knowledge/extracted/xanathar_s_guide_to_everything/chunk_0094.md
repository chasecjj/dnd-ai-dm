Trigger. A trip wire strung across a hallway is rigged 
to a large net. If the trip wire is broken, the net falls on 
intruders. An iron bell is als o rigged to the trip wire. It 
rings when the trap activates, alerting nearby guards. 
Effect. A net covering a 10-foot-by-10-foot a rea cen-
tered on the trip wire falls to the floor as a bell rings. 
Any creature fully within this area must s ucceed on a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A crea-
ture can use its action to make a DC 10 S trength check 
to try to free itself or another creature in the net. Deal-
ing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10, 20 hp) also 
frees a creature without harming the creature. 
Countermeasures. A s uccessful DC 15 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check reveals the trip wire and the net. A suc-
cessful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools dis-
ables the trip wire without caus ing the net to drop or the 
bell to ring; failing the check causes the trap to activate. 
PITTRAP 
S imple trap (level 1- 4, moderate threat) 
The simplest of pit traps consists of a 10-foot-deep bole 
in the floor, concealed by tattered canvas that's covered 
with leaves and dirt to look like solid ground. This type 
of trap is useful for blocking off the entrance to a mon-
ster lair, and usually has narrow ledges along its sides to 
allow for movement around it. 
Trigger. Anyone who steps on the canvas might fall 
into the pit. 
Effect. The triggering creature must make a DC 10 
Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the crea-
ture catches itself on the pit's edge or instinctively steps 
back. On a failed s ave, the creature falls into the pit and 
takes 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage from the fall. 
Countermeasures. A successful DC 10 Wis dom (Per-
ception) check reveals the presence of the canvas and 
the 1-foot-wide ledge around the edges of the pit where it 
is safe to travel. 
P OISON NEEDLE 
Simple trap (level 1-4, deadly threat) 
A tiny, poisoned needle hidden in a lock is a good way 
to discourage thieves from plundering a hoard. S uch 
a trap is us ua lly put in a chest or in the door to a trea-
sure chamber. 
Trigger. Anyone attempting to pick or open the lock 
triggers the trap. 
Effect. T he triggering creature must make a DC 20 
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature 
takes 14 (4d6) pois on damage and is poisoned for 10 
minutes. While poisoned in this way, the creature is pa r-
alyzed. On a s uccessful save, the creature takes ha lf as 
much da mage and isn't poisoned. 
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Wis dom (Per-
ception) check reveals the needle, but only if a character 
ins pects the lock. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check 
us ing thieves' tools disables the needle, and a check 
with a total of 10 or lower triggers the trap. 
S CYT H I NG B LADE 
Simple trap (level 5- 10, dangerous threat) 
This trap uses moving blades that sweep down through 
a chamber, threatening anyone nearby. Typically, a 
scything blade trap is activated by manipulating a lever 
or some other s imple device. Kobolds especially like this 
kind of trap, since it can take down bigger creatures. 
Trigger. When the lever is pulled, the trap activates. 
Effect. Each Medium or larger creature in a 5-foot-
wide, 20-foot-long area must make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) slashing damage on a 
failed s ave, or half as much da mage on a s uccessful one. 
Countermeasures. The lever isn't hidden. A success-
ful DC 15 Wis dom (Perception) check involving the 
s urfaces in the trap's area of effect reveals scrape ma rks 
and bloodstains on the wa lls and floor. A s uccessful 
DC 15 Dexterity check us ing thieves' tools disables 
the lever. 
SLEEP OF A GES 
Simple trap (level 11- 16, deadly threat) 
When a s leep of ages trap activates, a pressure plate 
unleashes a s pell that threatens to send intruders into a 
deep slumber. The dungeon's guardians can then more 
easily dispose of the sleepers. 
Trigger. Stepping on the pressure plate triggers 
this trap. 
Effect. When activated, this trap casts a sleep s pell 
centered on the press ure plate, using a 9 th-level 
s pell s lot. 
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Per-
ception) check reveals the pressure plate. A s uccessful 
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check made within 5 feet of 
the pressure plate disables the trap, and a check with a 
total of 10 or lower triggers it. A s uccessful dispel magic 
(DC 19) cast oo the pressure plate destroys the trap. 
DESIGNING SIMPLE TRA PS 
~~~~~~~~~ 
You can create your own s imple traps by using the fol-
low ing guidelines. You can a lso adapt the example traps 
for different levels and severity of threat by modifying 
their DCs and damage values as s hown below. 
P URPOSE 
Before diving into the details of your trap, think about 
its reason for being. Why would someone build such a 
trap? What is its purpose? Consider the trap's creator (in 
the adventure), the creator's purpose, and the location 
the trap protects. Traps have context in the world- they 
aren't created for no reason-and that context drives the 
trap's nature and effects. 
Described below are a few of the genera l purposes a 
trap might have. Use them to inspire the creation of your 
own traps. 
Alarm. An alarm trap is designed to alert an area's 
occupants of intruders. It might cause a bell or a gong 
to sound. This type of trap rarely involves a saving 
throw, because the alarm can't be avoided when the 
trap goes off. 
Delay. Some traps are designed to slow down ene-
mies, giving a dungeon's inhabitants time to mount a
