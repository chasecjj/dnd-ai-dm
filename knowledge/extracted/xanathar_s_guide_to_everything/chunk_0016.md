DRUID 
EVEN IN DEATH, EACH CREATURE PLAYS ITS PART IN 
maintainingthe Great Balance. But now an imbalance 
grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is 
the destructive behavior of the mortal races. The farther 
away from nature their actions take them, the more cor-
rupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly 
to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but 
there are times when we must rise up against danger and 
eradicate it. 
-Safhran, archdruid 
Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is 
said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, 
s peaking the truth that is too subtle for the general pop-
ulace to hear. Many who become druids find that they 
naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and 
movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and 
insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, 
writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids 
are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin 
to embody these natural forces, producing magical 
phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and 
the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious 
power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered 
dangerous by the people a round them. 
Your druid character might be a true worshiper of na-
ture, one who has a lways scorned civilization and found 
solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of 
the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into 
harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections 
that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how 
your character came to the profession. 
TREASURED ITEM 
Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred 
to them or have deep personal significance. S uch items 
are not necessarily magical, but every one is a n object 
whose meaning connects the druid's mind and heart to 
a profound concept or spiritual outlook. 
When you decide what your character's treasured 
item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you 
come by the item, and why is it important to you?

GUIDING ASPECT 
Many druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the 
natural world, such as a body of water, an animal, a type 
of tree, or some other sort of plant. You identify with 
your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it 
sets an example that you seek to emulate. 
GUIDING ASPECTS 
d6 
Guiding Aspect 
Yew trees remind you of renewing your mind and 
spirit, letting the old die and the new spring forth. 
2 
Oak trees represent strength and vitality. Medi-
tating under an oak fills your body and mind with 
resolve and fortitude. 
3 
The river's endless flow reminds you of the great 
span of the world. You seek to act with the long-
term interests of nature in mind. 
4 
The sea is a constant, churning cauldron of power 
and chaos. It reminds you that accepting change is 
necessary to sustain yourself in the world. 
5 
The birds in the sky are evidence that even the 
smallest creatures can survive if they remain above 
the fray. 
6 
As demonstrated by the actions of the wolf, an 
individual's strength is nothing compared to the 
powet of the pack. 
MENTOR 
It's not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be 
sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the 
basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from 
a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the 
mentor has a vital role in shaping a student's attitudes 
a nd beliefs. 
If your character received training from someone 
else, who or what was that individual, and what was the 
nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you 
with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your 
approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?
