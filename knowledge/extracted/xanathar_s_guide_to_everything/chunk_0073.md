For example, reading the row for 1st-level characters 
from the 1st- 5th Level table, we see that one 1st-level 
character is the equiva lent of two CR 1/8 monsters or 
one CR 1/4 monster. The ratio reverses for higher cha l-
lenge ratings, where a single monster is more powerful 
than a single 1st-level character. One CR 1/2 creature is 
equivalent to three 1st-level characters, while one CR 1 
opponent is equivalent to five. 
Let's say you have a party of four 3rd-level characters. 
Using the table, you can see that one CR 2 foe is a good 
match for the entire party, but that the characters w ill 
likely have a hard time handling a CR 3 creature. 
Using the same guidelines, you can mix and match 
challenge ratings to put together a group of creatures 
to oppose four 3rd-level characters. For example, you 
could select one CR 1 creature. That's worth two 3rd-
level characters, leaving you with two characters' worth 
of mons ters to allocate. You could then add two CR 1/4 
monsters to account for one other character and one CR 
1/2 mons ter to account for the final character. In total, 
your encounter has one CR 1, one CR 1/2, and two CR 
1/4 creatures. 
For groups in which the characters are of different lev-
els, you have two options. You can group all characters 
of the same level. together, match them with monsters, 
and then combine all the creatures into one encounter. 
Alternatively, you can determine the group's average 
level and treat each character as being of that level for 
the purpose of selecting appropriate monsters. 
The above guidelines a re designed to create a fight 
that will challenge a party while still being winnable. 
If you want to create an easier encounter that w ill 
challenge characters but not threaten to defeat them, 
you can treat the party as if it were roughly one-third 
smaller than it is. For example, to make an easy encoun-
ter for a party of five characters, put them up against 
monsters that would be a tough fight for three charac-
ters. Likewise, you can treat the party as up to ha lf again 
larger to build a battle that is potentially deadly, though 
still not likely to be an automatic defeat. A party of four 
characters facing an encounter designed for six charac-
ters would fall into this category. 
WEAK MONSTERS AND HIGH-LEVEL 
CHARACTERS 
To save space on the tables and keep them simple, some 
of the lower challenge ratings are missing from the high-
er-level tables. For low challenge ratings not appearing 
on the table, assume a 1:12 ratio, indicating that twelve 
creatures of those challenge ratings are equivalent to 
one character of a specific level. 
STEP 4: SELECT MONSTERS 
After using the tables from the previous step to deter-
mine the challenge ratings of the monsters in your en-
counter, you're ready to pick individual monsters. This 
process is more of an art than a science. 
In addition to assessing monsters by challenge rating, 
it's important to look at how certain monsters might
