VITRIOLIC SPHERE 
4th-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 150 feet 
Components: V, S , M (a drop of giant slug bile) 
Duration: Instantaneous 
You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 
1-foot-cliameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and 
explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in 
that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a 
failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and an-
other 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a 
s uccessful save, a creature takes half the initial damage 
and no damage at the end of its next turn. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage in-
creases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th. 
WALL OF LIGHT 
5th-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a hand mirror) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
A shimmering wall of bright Light appears at a point you 
choose within range. The wall appears in any orienta-
tion you choose: horizontally, vertica lly, or diagonally. It 
can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The 
wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet 
thick. The wall blocks line of sight, but creatures and ob-
jects can pass through it. It emits bright light out to 120 
feet and dim light for an additional 120 feet. 
When the wall appears, each creature in its area must 
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 
1 minute. On a s uccessful save, it takes half as much 
damage and is n't blinded. A blinded creature can make 
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
A creature that ends its turn in the wall's area takes 
4d8 radiant damage. 
Until the spell ends, you can use an action to launch a 
beam of radiance from the wall at one creature you can 
see within 60 feet of it. Make a ranged spell attack. On 
a hit, the target takes 4d8 radiant damage. Whether you 
hit or miss, reduce the length of the wall by 10 feet. If 
the wall's length drops to 0 feet, the spell ends. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 
ld8 for each slot level above 5th. 
WALL OF SAND 
3rd-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a handful of sand) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
You create a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a 
point you can see within range. You can make the wall 
up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 10 feet thick, and it 
vanishes when the spell ends. It blocks line of sight but 
not movement. A creature is blinded while in the wall's 
space and must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 
foot it moves there. 
WALL OF WATER 
3rd-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a drop of water) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you 
can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 
feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make 
a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 
1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The 
wall's space is difficult terrain. 
Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space 
has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage 
is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to 
reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass 
through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass 
through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is 
frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 
15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points 
destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water 
doesn't fill it. 
WARDING WIND 
2nd-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 
10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered 
on you. The wind lasts for the spell's duration. 
The wind has the following effects: 
• It deafens you and other creatures in its area . 
• It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are 
torch-sized or sma ller. 
• It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed 
by strong wind. 
• The area is difficult terrain for creatures 
other than you. 
• The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disad-
vantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind. 
WATERY SPHERE 
4th-level conjuration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a droplet of water) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at 
a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover 
but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere re-
mains for the spell's duration.
