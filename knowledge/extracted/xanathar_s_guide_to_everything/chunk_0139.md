mand to each one.) You decide what action the creature 
will take and where it will move during its next turn, or 
you can issue a simple, general command, such as to 
fetch a key, stand watch, or s tack some books. If you is-
sue no commands, the servant does nothing other than 
defend itself agains t hostile creatures. Once given an 
order, the servant continues to follow that order until its 
task is complete. 
When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to 
its original form, and any remaining damage carries 
over to that form. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two ad-
ditional objects for each s lot level above 3rd. 
TOLL THE DEA D 
Necromancy can trip 
Casting Time: l action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 
You point at one creature you can see within range, 
and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it 
for a moment. The target must s ucceed on a Wisdom 
saving throw or take ld8 necrotic damage. If the target 
is missing a ny of its hit points, it instead takes ldl2 ne-
crotic damage. 
The spell's damage increases by one die when you 
reach 5th level (2d8 or 2dl2), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), 
and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12). 
TRAN SM UTE ROCK 
5th-level transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S , M (clay and water) 
Duration: Until dispelled 
You choose an area of stone or mud that you can see 
that fits within a 40-foot cube and is within range, and 
choose one of the following effects. 
Transmute Rock to Mud. Nonmagical rock of any 
sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flow-
ing mud that remains for the spell's duration. 
The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough 
that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature 
moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and 
any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must 
make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also 
make the saving throw when it moves into the area for 
the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed 
save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, 
though it can use an action to end the restrained condi-
tion on itself by pulling itself free of the mud. 
If you cast the s pell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any 
creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dex-
terity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. 
Transmute Mud to Rock. Nonmagical mud or quick-
sand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms 
into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in 
the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity sav-
ing throw. bn a successful save, a creature is s hunted 
safely to the s urface in an unoccupied s pace. On a failed 
save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A re-
strained creature, or another creature within reach, can 
use a n action to try to break the rock by succeeding on 
a DC 20 S trength check or by dealing damage to it. The 
rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to 
poison and psychic damage.
