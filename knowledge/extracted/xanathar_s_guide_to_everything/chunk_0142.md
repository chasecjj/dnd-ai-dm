APPENDIX A: SHARED CAMPAIGNS 
Coordinating a regular schedule of D&D game sessions, 
to keep a campaign active and vibrant, can be a chal-
lenge. If the campaign's only Dungeon Master or enough 
players aren't available, the next session might have to 
be postponed, and repeated problems of this sort can 
endanger the continuation of the campaign. 
In short: in a world filled with distractions, it can be 
hard to keep a campaign going. Enter the concept of the 
shared campaign. 
In a shared campaign, more than one member of the 
group can take on the role of DM. A shared campaign is 
episodic rather than continuous, with each play session 
comprising a complete adventure. 
The largest shared campaigns are administered by 
the D&D Adventurers League and overseen by Wizards 
of the Coast. You can also create your own shared cam-
pa ign for a school D&D club, at a game store, a libra ry, 
or anywhere else where D&D players and DMs gather. 
A shared campaign establishes a framework that al-
lows a player to take a character from one DM's game 
to another one within the shared campaign. It creates a 
situation where almost nothing can prevent a scheduled 
session from happening. The roster of potential players 
can be qu.ite large, virtually ensuring that any session 
has at least the minimum number of characters needed 
to play. If everyone shows up to play at the same time, 
multiple DMs ensure that everyone can take part. 
CODE OF CO N DUCT 
Time and time again, the core rulebooks come back to 
the point that the most important goal of a D&D play ses-
sion is for everyone involved to have fun. In keeping with 
that goal, it's a good idea for a shared campaign to have 
a code of conduct. Because people who don't normally 
play together might end up at the same table in a shared 
campaign, it can be helpful to establish some ground rules 
for behavior. 
On the broadest level, everyone in a shared campaign 
is responsible for making sure that everyone else has an 
enjoyable time. If anyone feels offended, belittled, or bul-
lied by the actions of another person, the entire purpose of 
getting together to play is defeated. 
The basic code of conduct for a shared campaign might 
be modeled on a similar document that another organiza-
tion or location uses. Beyond that, some special policies 
might need to be added to account for what might happen 
at the table when players and DMs interact. As a starting 
point, consider the following material, which is excerpted 
from the Adventurers League code of conduct. 
During a play session, participants are expected to ... 
• Follow the DM's lead and refrain from arguing with the 
DM or other players over rules. 
• Let other players speak, and allow other players to get 
attention from the OM. 
• Avoid excessive conversation that is not relevant to the 
adventure. 
• Discourage others from usi ng social media to bully, 
shame, or intimidate other participants. 
• Make the DM or the campaign's administrators aware 
of disruptive or aggressive behavior so that appropriate 
action can be taken. 
APPENDIX A f SHARED CAMPAIGNS 
In order to be s uccessful, a shared campaign needs 
a champion-someone who takes on the responsibil-
ity of organizing and maintaining the group. U you're 
interested in learning more about how to run a shared 
campaign and seeing how the Adventurers League 
handles certa in issues, then the rest of this appendix is 
meant for you. 
DESIGNING ADVENTURES 
Designing adventures for a shared campaign involves a 
different set of considerations than designing for a stan-
dard group of players. Most important, the adventure 
must be timed to conclude when the session is sched-
uled to end. You also need to balance combat encounters 
for a range of levels, since a wide range of characters 
might be experiencing the adventure at the same time. 
ADVENTURE DURATION 
Every adventure in a shared campaign begins and ends 
in the same play session. (If a group of participants 
wants to take longer to finish and all are wiJling to do 
so, they can exceed the time limit.) A session or an event 
can't end with the adventure unfinished, since there's no 
way to guarantee that the same players and DM will be 
available for the next session. 
Typically, adventures in a shared campaign are de-
signed to take either 2 hours or 4 hours. In each hour of 
play, assume the characters can complete the following: 
• Three or four simple combat encounters, or one or 
two complex ones 
• Three or four scenes involving significant exploration 
or social interaction 
Within these constraints, it can be difficult to create 
open-ended adventures. A time limit assumes a specific 
starting point and endpoint. A good way to get around 
this restriction is to create an adventure with multiple 
possible endings. 
Location-based adventures also work well with this 
format. A dungeon presents a natural limit on character 
options, while strn giving the players choices. The ad-
venture could be a quest to defeat a creature or recover 
an item, but the path to achieving that goal can be differ-
ent for each group. 
For more narrative adventures, try to focus on simple 
but flexible encounters or events. For instance, an ad-
venture requires the characters to protect a high priest 
of Tyr from assassins. Give the players a chance to plan 
out how they want to protect the temple, complete with 
authority over the guards. A few well-fleshed out NPCs, 
some of whom might be suspected of working with the 
temple's enemies, add a layer of tension. Consider leav-
ing some details or plot points for the DM to decide. For 
example, the DM might have the option to pick which 
member of the temple guards is the traitor, ensuring 
that the scenario is different for each group.
