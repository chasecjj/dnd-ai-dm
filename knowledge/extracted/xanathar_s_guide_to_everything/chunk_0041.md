Storm sorcerers a re invaluable members of a ship's 
crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over 
wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abili-
ties also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, 
pirates, and other waterborne threats.

WIND SPEAKER 
The arcane magic you command is infused with ele-
mental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. 
Knowing this language allows you to understand and 
be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, 
Auran, Ignan, and Terran. 
TEMPESTUOUS MAGIC 
Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your 
turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly 
surround you, immediately before or after you cast a 
s pell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up 
to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. 
HEART OF THE STORM 
At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder 
damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell 
of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder 
damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption 
causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 
10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage 
(choose each time this ability activates) equal to half 
your sorcerer level. 
STORM GUIDE 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the 
weather around you. 
If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain 
to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on 
you. You can end this effect as a bonus action. 
If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each 
round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 
100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows 
in that direction until the end of your next turn. This fea-
ture doesn't alter the speed of the wind. 
STORM'S FURY 
S tarting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee at-
tack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage 
to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. 
The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw 
against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, 
the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet 
away from you. 
WIND SOUL 
At 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thun-
der damage. 
You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an 
action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 
hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet 
of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen 
creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 
hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you 
can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

WARLOCK 
You THINK ME MAD? I THINK TRUE INSANITY IS BEING 
content to live a life of mortal drudge1y when knowledge 
and power is therefor the taking in the realm beyond. 
-Xarren, herald of Acamar 
Warlocks are finders and keepers of secrets. They push 
at the edge of our understanding of the world, always 
seeking to expand their expertise. Where sages or wiz-
ards might heed a clear sign of danger and end their 
research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless of the cost. 
Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curios-
ity, and recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk 
would describe that combination as evidence of mad-
ness. Warlocks see it as a demonstration of bravery. 
Warlocks are defined by two elements that work 
in concert to forge their path into this class. The first 
element is the event or circumstances that led to a 
warlock's entering into a pact with a planar entity. The 
second one is the nature of the entity a warlock is bound 
to. Unlike clerics, who typically embrace a deity and that 
god's ethos, a warlock might have no love for a patron, 
or vice versa. 
The sections that follow provide ways to embellish a 
warlock character that could generate some intriguing 
story and roleplaying opportunities. 
PATRON'S ATTITUDE 
Every relationship is a two-way street, but in the case of 
warlocks and their patrons it's not necessarily true that 
both sides of the street are the same width or made of 
the same stuff. The feeling that a warlock holds for their 
patron, whether positive or negative, might be recipro-
cated by the patron, or the two participants in the pact 
might view one another with opposing emotions. 
When you determine the attitude your warlock charac-
ter holds toward your patron, also consider how things 
look from the patron's perspective. How does your pa-
tron behave toward you? Is your patron a friend and ally, 
or an enemy that grants you power only because you 
forced a pact upon it?

PATRON ATTITUDES

Your patron has guided and helped your family for 
generations and is kindly toward you. 
Each interaction with your capricious patron is a 
surprise, whether pleasant or painful. 
Your patron is the spirit of a long-dead hero who 
sees your pact as a way for it to continue to influ-
ence the world. 
Your patron is a strict disciplinarian but treats you 
with a measure of respect. 
Your patron tricked you into a pact and treats you 
as a slave. 
You are mostly left to your own devices with no in-
terference from your patron. Sometimes you dread 
the demands it will make when it does appear. 
SPECIAL TERMS OF THE PACT 
A pact can range from a loose agreement to a formal 
contract with lengthy, detailed clauses and lists of re-
quirements. The terms of a pact- what a warlock must 
do to receive a patron's favor- are always dictated by 
the patron. On occasion, those terms include a special 
proviso that might seem odd or whimsical, but warlocks 
take these dictates as seriously as they do the other re-
quirements of their pacts. 
Does your character have a pact that requires you 
to change your behavior in an unusual or seemingly 
frivolous way? Even if your patron hasn't imposed 
s uch a duty on you already, that's not to say it couldn't 
still happen.

When directed, you must take immediate action 
against a specific enemy of your patron. 
Your pact tests your willpower; you are required to 
abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants. 
At least once a day, you must inscribe o r carve your 
patron's name or symbol on the wall of a building. 
You must occasionally conduct bizarre rituals to 
maintain your pact. 
You can never wear the same outfit twice, since 
your patron finds such predictability to be boring. 
When you use an eldritch invocation, you must 
speak your patron's name aloud or risk incurring 
its displeasure.
