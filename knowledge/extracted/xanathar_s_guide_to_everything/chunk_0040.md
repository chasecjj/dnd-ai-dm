EYES OF THE DARK 
Starting at 1st level, you have darkvision with a range 
of 120 feet. 
When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn 
the darkness spell, which doesn't count against your 
number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can 
cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a 
spell slot. U you cast it with sorcery points, you can see 
through the darkness created by the spell. 
STRENGTH OF THE GRAVE 
Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state be-
tween life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When 
damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a 
Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On 
a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can't use 
this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant 
damage or by a critical hit. 
After the saving throw succeeds, you can't use this 
feature again until you finish a long rest. 
HOUND OF ILL OMEN 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling 
creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus 
action, you can s pend 3 sorcery points to magically 
summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you 
can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire 
wolf's statistics (see the Monster Manual or appendix C 
in the Player's Handbook), with the following changes: 
• The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as 
a monstrosity, not a beast. 
• It appears with a number of temporary hit points 
equal to half your sorcerer level. 
• It can move through other creatures and objects as 
if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force 
damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 
• At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows 
its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no 
longer hidden from the hound. 
The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your 
choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the 
hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by 
the most direct route, and it can use its action only to at-
tack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, 
but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound 
is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage 
on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound 
disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is 
reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes. 
SHADOW WALK 
At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one 
shadow into another. When you are in dim light or dark-
ness, as a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 
120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also 
in dim light or darkness . 
UMBRALFORM 
Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points 
as a bonus action to magically transform yourself into 
a shadowy form. In this form, you have resistance to 
all damage except force and radiant damage, and you 
can move through other creatures and objects as if they 
were difficL1.lt terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end 
your turn inside an object. 
You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if 
you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a 
bonus action. 
STORM SORCERY 
Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental 
air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to 
a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but 
perhaps you were born during a howling gale so power-
ful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might 
include the influence of potent air creatures such as 
djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm perme-
ates your being.
