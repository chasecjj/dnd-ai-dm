Manual. It is your faithful companion, a nd it dies if you 
die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up

die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit 
point maximum is reduced by the total, a nd the homun-
culus's hit point maximum and current hit points are 
both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no 
lower than 1 hit point, a nd the change to your and the 
homunculus's hit points ends when you finis h your next 
long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can't 
be removed by any means before then, except by the ho-
