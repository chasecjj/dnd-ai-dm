CLOCKWORK AMULET 
Wondrous item, common 
This copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears 
and is powered by magic from Mechanus, a plane of 
clockwork predictability. A creature that puts an ear to 
the amulet can hear faint ticking and whirring noises 
coming from within. 
When you make an attack roll while wearing the am-
ulet, you can forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die. 
Once used, this property can't be used again until the 
next dawn. 
CLOTHES OF MENDING 
Wondrous item, common 
This elegant outfit of traveler's clothes magically mends 
itself to counteract daily wear and tear. Pieces of the out-
fit that are destroyed can't be repaired in this way. 
DARK SHARD AMULET 
Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a 
warlock) 
This amulet is fashioned from a single shard of resilient 
extraplanar material originating from the realm of your 
warlock patron. While you are wearing it, you gain the 
following benefits: 
• You can use the amulet as a spellcasting focus for 
your warlock spells. 
• You can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The 
cantrip must be on the warlock spell list, and you 
must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the 
check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, 
so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell 
is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property 
again until you finish a long rest. 
DREAD HELM 
Wondrous item, common 
This fearsome steel helm makes your eyes glow red 
while you wear it. 
EAR HORN OF HEARING

fects of the deafened condition on you, allowing you to 
hear normally. 
ENDURING SPELLBOOK 
Wondrous item, common 
This spellbook, a long w ith anything written on its 
pages, can't be damaged by fire or immers ion in water. 
In addition, the spellbook doesn't deteriorate with age. 
ERSATZ EYE 
Wondrous item, common (requires attunement) 
This artificial eye replaces a real one that was lost or 
removed. While the ersatz eye is embedded in your eye 
socket, it can't be removed by anyone other than you, 
and you can see through the tiny orb as though it were a 
normal eye. 
HAT OF VERMIN 
Wondrous item, common 
This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can 
use an action to expend 1 of its charges and speak a 
command word that s ummons your choice of a bat, a 
frog, or a rat (see the Player's Handbook or the Monster 
Manual for statistics). The summoned creature magi-
cally appears in the hat and tries to get away from you 
as quickly as possible. The creature is neither friendly 
nor hostile, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as 
an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 
hour or when it drops to 0 hit points. The hat regains all 
expended charges daily at dawn. 
HAT OF WIZARDRY 
Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a 
wizard) 
This antiquated, cone-shaped hat is adorned with gold 
crescent moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you 
gain the following benefits: 
• You can use the hat as a spellcasting focus for your 
wizard spells. 
You can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The 
cantrip must be on the wizard spell list, and you must 
make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the 
check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, 
so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell 
is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property 
again until you finish a long rest. 
REWARD'S HANDY SPICE POUCH 
Wondrous item, common 
This belt pouch appears empty and has 10 charges. 
While holding the pouch, you can use an action to ex-
pend 1 of its charges, speak the na me of any nonmag-
ical food seasoning (such as salt, pepper, saffron, or 
cilantro), and remove a pinch of the desired seasoning 
from the pouch. A pinch is enough to season a single 
meal. The pouch regains ld6 + 4 expended charges 
daily at dawn. 
HORN OF SILENT ALARM 
Wondrous item, common 
This horn has 4 charges. When you use an action to 
blow it, one creature of your choice can hear the horn's 
blare, provided the creature is within 600 feet of the 
horn and not deafened. No other creature hears sound 
coming from the horn. The horn regains ld4 expended 
char ges daily at dawn. 
INSTRUMENT OF ILLUSIONS 
Wondrous item, common (requires attunement) 
While you are playing this musical instrument, you 
can create harmless, illusory visual effects within a 
5-foot-radius sphere centered on the instrument. If 
you are a bard, the radius increases to 15 feet. Sample 
visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spec-
tral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The 
magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and 
they are obviously illusory. T he effects end when you 
stop playing.
