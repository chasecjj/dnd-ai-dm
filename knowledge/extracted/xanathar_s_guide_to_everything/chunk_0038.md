SORCERER 
PRACTICE AND STUDY ARE FOR AMATEURS. TRUE POWER 
is a birthright. 
- Hennet, scion ofTiamat 
When it comes to drawing forth their abilities in times 
of need, sorcerers have it easy compared to other char-
acters. Their power not only rests within them, but it 
likely takes some effort to keep it at bay. Every sorcerer 
is born to the role, or stumbles into it through cosmic 
chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively 
learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have 
their power thrust upon them. 
Because the idea of an innately magical being trav-
eling among them does not sit well with many folk, 
sorcerers tend to breed mistrust and s uspicion in others 
they come across. Nonetheless, many sorcerers succeed 
in overcoming that prejudice through deeds that benefit 
their Jess magically gifted contemporaries. 
Sorcerers are often defined by the events surroundjng 
the manifestation of their power. For those who receive 
it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause 
for celebration. Other sorcerers are treated as outcasts, 
banished from their homes after the sudden, terrifying 
arrival of their abilities. 
Playing a sorcerer character can be as rewarrung as it 
is challenging. The sections below offer suggestions on 
how to flesh out and personalize your persona. 
ARCANE ORIGIN 
Some sorcerers understand where their power came 
from, based on how their abilities manifested. Others 
can only speculate, since their powers came to them in a 
way that suggests no particular cause. 
Does your character know the source of your magi-
cal power? Does it tie back to some distant relative, a 
cosmic event, or blind chance? If your sorcerer doesn't 
know where their power arose from, your DM can use 
this table (or select an origin) and reveal it to you when 
the information plays a role in the campaign.

REACTIO N 
When a new sorcerer enters the world, either at birth 
or later when one's power becomes evident, the con-

world around you respond? Were other people support-
ive, fearful, or somewhere in between?

SUPER NATURAL MARK 
A sorcerer at rest is almost indistinguishable from a 
normal person; it's only when their magic flies forth that 
sorcerers reveal their true nature. Even so, many sorcer-
ers have a subtle but telling physical trait that sets them 
apart from other folk.
