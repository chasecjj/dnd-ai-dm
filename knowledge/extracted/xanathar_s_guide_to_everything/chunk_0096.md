TRIGGERS 
A trigger is the circumstance that needs to take place to 
activate the trap. 
Decide what causes the trap to activate and determine 
how the characters can find the trigger. Here are some 
example triggers: 
A pressure plate that, when it is stepped on, acti-
vates the trap 
• A trip wire that springs a trap when it is broken, usu-
ally when someone walks through it 
• A doorknob that activates a trap when it is turned 
the wrong way 
• A door or chest that triggers a trap when it is opened 
A trigger usually needs to be hidden to be effective. Oth-
erwise, avoiding the trap is usually easy. 
A trigger requires a Wisdom (Perception) check if 
s imply spotting it reveals its nature. The characters can 
foi l a pit trap hidden by a leaf-covered net if they s pot the 
pit through a gap in the leaves. A trip wire is foiled if it is 
spotted, as is a pressure plate. 
Other traps require careful inspection and deduction 
to notice. A doorknob opens a door when turned to the 
left, but activates a trap when turned to the right. Such a 
subtle trap requires a successful Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check to notice. The trigger is obvious. Understand-
ing its nature is not. 
The DC of the check, regardless of its type, depends 
on the s kill and care taken to conceal the trap. Most 
traps can be detected with a successful DC 20 check, 
but a crudely made or hastily built trap has a DC of 15. 
Exceptionally devious traps might have a DC of 25. 
You must then put some thought into what the char-
acters learn with a successful check. In most cases, the 
check reveals the trap. In other cases, it uncovers clues, 
but foiling the trap still requires some deduction. The 
characters might succeed on the check but still trigger 
the trap if they don't unders tand what they have learned. 
EFFECTS 
Designing a trap's effects is a straightforward process. 
The tables for saving throw DCs, attack bonuses, dam-
age, and the like give you a starting point for most sim-
ple traps that deal damage. 
For traps with more complex effects, your best s tart-
ing point is to use the Spell Equivalent by Level table to 
find the best match for your trap's intended effect. Spells 
are a good starting point because they are compact 
pieces of game design that deliver specific effects. 
If you are us ing a spell as a starting point, check to see 
if you need to tweak its effects to fit the trap's nature. For 
instance, you can easily change the damage type a spell 
delivers or the saving throw it requires. 
DISARMING A SIMPLE TRAP 
Only one successful ability check is required to disarm 
a s imple trap. Imagine how your trap operates, and then 
think about how the characters could overcome it. More 
than one kind of ability check might be possible. S ome 
traps are so poorly concealed that they can be discov-
ered or circumvented without active effort. For instance, 
a hidden pit trap is effectively disarmed as soon as the 
characters notice it. After that, they can simply walk 
around it, or they can climb down one side, walk across 
the bottom of the pit, and climb up the other side. 
Once you determine how a trap can be disarmed or 
avoided, decide the appropriate ability a nd skill com-
binations that characters can use. A Dexterity check 
us ing thieves' tools, a Strength (Athletics) check, and an 
Intelligence (Arcana) check are all commonly used for 
this purpose . 
A Dexterity check using thieves' tools can apply to any 
trap that has a mechanical element. Thieves' tools can 
be used to disable a trip w ire or a pressure plate, disas-
semble a poison needle mechanism, or clog a valve that 
leaks poisonous gas into a room. 
A Strength check is often the method for thwarting 
traps that can be destroyed or prevented from operating 
through the use of brute force. A scything blade can be 
broken, a s liding block can be held in place, or a net can 
be torn apart. 
A magic trap can be disabled by someone who can 
undermine the magic used to power it. Typically, a suc-
cessfu l Intelligence (Arcana) check enables a character 
to figure out how a magic trap functions and how to ne-
gate its effect. For instance, the character could discover 
that a statue that belches a jet of magical flame can be 
disabled by s hattering one of its glass eyes. 
Once you k now what kind of check is called for, you 
then determine what happens on a failed attempt to dis-
able the trap. Depending on the kind of check involved 
and the nature of the trap, you might determine that any 
failed check has negative consequences- usually involv-
ing the triggering of the trap. At other times, you could 
assign a number that the check must exceed to prevent 
the trap from going off. If the total of the check is equal 
to or lower than that number, the trap activates. 
PLACING A SIMPLE TRAP 
Context and environment a re critical when it comes 
to properly locating a trap. A swinging log trap that's 
meant to knock characters aside is a mere inconve-
nience on a typical forest path, where it can be easily 
circumvented. But it's a potentially deadly hazard on a 
narrow trail that hugs the s ide of a towering cliff face. 
Choke points and narrow passages that lead to im-
portant places in a dungeon a re good spots for traps, 
especially those that serve as alarms or restraints. The 
goal is to foil or delay intruders before they can reach a 
critical location, giving the dungeon's denizens a chance 
to mount a defense or a counterattack. 
A treasure chest, a door leading to a vault, or any other 
obstacle 'or container that bars the way to a valuable 
treasure is the ideal location for a slaying trap. In s uch 
instances, the trap is the last line of defense against a 
thief or intruder. 
Alarm traps, since they pose no direct physical 
threat, are appropriate for areas that are also used by 
a dungeon's denizens-assuming the residents know 
about the trap and how to avoid setting it off. Accidents 
can happen, but if a goblin stumbles inside its den and 
activates an alarm trap, there's no real harm done. The 
alarm sounds, the guards arrive, they punish the clumsy 
goblin, and they reset the trap.
