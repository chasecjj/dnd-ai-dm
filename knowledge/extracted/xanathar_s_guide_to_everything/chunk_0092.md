TRAPS REVISITED 
The ruJes for traps in the Dungeon Master's Guide pro-
vide the basic information you need to manage traps 
at the game table. The material here takes a different, 
more elaborate approach- describing traps in terms of 
their game mechanics and offering guidance on creating 
traps of your own using these new rules. 
Rather than characterize traps as mechanical or magi-
cal, these rules separate traps into two other categories: 
s imple and complex. 
A simple trap activates and is thereafter harmless or 
easily avoided. A hidden pit dug at the entra nce of a 
goblin lair, a poison needle that pops from a lock, and 
a crossbow rigged to fire when an intruder steps on a 
pressure plate are all simple traps. 
ELEMENTS OF A SIMPLE TRAP 
The description of a s imple trap begins with a line that 
gives the trap's level and the severity of the threat it 
poses. Following a general note on what the trap looks 
like and how it functions are three paragraphs that tell 
how the trap works in the game. 
Level and Threat. A trap's level is actually a range of 
levels, equivalent to one of the tiers of play (levels 1- 4, 
5- 10, 11-16, and 17- 20), indicating the appropriate time 
to use the trap in your campaign. Additionally, each trap 
poses either a moderate, da ngerous, or deadly threat, 
based on its particular details. 
Trigger. A s imple trap activates when an event occurs 
that triggers it. This entry in a trap's description gives 
the location of the trigger and the activity that causes 
the trap to activate. 
Effect. A trap's effect occurs after it activates. The 
trap might fire a dart, unleash a cloud of poison gas, 
cause a bidden enclosure to open, and so on. This en-
try specifies what the trap targets, its attack bonus or 
saving throw DC, and what happens on a hit or a failed 
saving throw. 
Countermeasures. Traps can be detected or defeated 
in a variety of ways by using ability checks or magic. 
This entry in a trap's description gives the means for 
counteracting the trap. It also specifies what happens, if 
anything, on a failed attempt to disable it. 
RUNNING A SIMPLE TRAP 
To prepare for us ing a simple trap in play, start by mak-
ing note of the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) 
scores. Most traps allow Wisdom (Perception) checks 
to detect their triggers or other elements that can tip off 
their presence. If you stop to ask players for this infor-
mation, they might suspect a hidden danger. 
When a trap is triggered, apply its effects as specified 
in its description. 
If the characters discover a trap, be open to adjudicat-
ing their ideas for defeating it. The trap's description is 
a starting point for countermeasures, rather than a com-
plete definition. 
To make it easier for you to describe what happens 
next, the players s hould be specific about how they want 
to defeat the trap. Simply s tating the desire to make a 
check isn't helpful for you. Ask the players where their 
characters are positioned and what they intend to do to 
defeat the trap.
