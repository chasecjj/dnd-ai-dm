Confiict. Drama embodies conflict, a nd the best 
stories have conflict as a key element. From the morn-
ing-after tale of a tavern brawl to the saga of an epic 
battle, from a lover's spat to a rift between powerful 
dynasties, conflict is what inspires tale-tellers like you to 
create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in 
some people, causing their heroic nature to shine forth 
a nd transform the world, but it can cause others to grav-
itate toward darkness and fall under the sway of evil. 
You strive to experience or witness a ll forms of conflict, 
great and small, so as to study this eternal aspect of life 
and immortalize it in your words a nd music. 
BARD COLLEGES 
At 3rd level, a bard gains the Ba rd College feature. The 
following options are available to a bard, in addition 
to those offered in the Player's Handbook: the College 
of Gla mour, the College of Swords, and the College 
of Whis pers. 
COLLEGE OF GLAMOUR 
The College of Gla mour is the home of bards who mas-
tered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or 
under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tu-
tored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn 
to use their magic to delight and captivate others. 
The ba rds of this college are regarded with a mixture 
of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of leg-
end. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song 
that one of them performs can cause captors to release 
the bard unharmed and can luU a furious dragon into 
complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell 
beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this 
college can leech off a community for weeks, misusing 
their magic to turn their hosts into thra lls. Heroic bards 
of this college instead use this power to gladden the 
downtrodden a nd undermine oppressors.

M ANTLE OF I NSPIRATION 
When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you 
gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues 
your allies with vigor and speed. 
As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your 
Ba rdic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appear-
ance. When you do so, choose a number of creatures 
you can see a nd that can see you within 60 feet of you, 
up to a number equa l to your Charisma modifier (mini-
mum of one). Each of them gains 5 tempora ry hit points. 
When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it 
can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed, 
without provoking opportunity attacks. 
The number of temporary hit points increases when 
you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 
5th level, 11 at 10th level, and 14 at 15th level. 
CHAPTER 1 I CHARACTER OPTIONS 
ENTHRALLING PERFORMANCE 
S tarting at 3r9 level, you can charge your performance 
with seductive, fey magic. 
If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt 
to ins pire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting 
a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, 
choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you 
who watched and listened to a ll of it, up to a number 
equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). 
Each target must s ucceed on a Wisdom saving throw 
against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While 
charmed in this way, the ta rget idolizes you, it speaks 
glowingly of you to anyone who ta lks to it, and it hinders 
anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence 
unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. 
This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any 
damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking 
or damaging any of its a llies. 
If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has 
no hint that you tried to charm it. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest. 
M ANTL E OF MAJESTY 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey 
magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus 
action, you cast command, without expending a spell 
slot, and you take on an appeara nce of unearthly beauty 
for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you 
were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you 
can cast command as a bonus action on each of your 
turns, without expending a spell slot. 
Any creature charmed by you automatically fails 
its saving throw against the command you cast with 
this feature. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 
UN BREAKABLE M AJ ESTY 
At 14th level, your appeara nce permanently gains an 
otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely 
and fierce. 
In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a mag-
ically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are 
incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature 
tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the at-
tacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your 
spell save DC. On a failed save, it can't attack you on this 
turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the 
attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you
