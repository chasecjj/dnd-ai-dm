Dim, greenish light spreads withfo a 30-foot-radius 
sphere centered on a point you choose within range. 
The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the 
spell ends. 
When a creature moves into the spell's area for the 
first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature 
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 
4d10 radiant damage, and it suffers one level of exhaus-
tion and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. 
This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit 
from being invisible. The light and any levels of exhaus-
tion caused by this spell go away when the spell ends. 
SKILL EMPOWERMENT 
5th-level transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 
Your magic deepens a creature's understanding of its 
own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it 
expertise in one skill of your choice; until the spell ends, 
the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability 
checks it makes that use the chosen skill. 
You must choose a skill in which the target is profi-
cient and that isn't already benefiting from an effect, 
such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus. 
SKYWRITE 
2nd-level transmutation (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Sight 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 
You cause up to ten words to form in a part of the sky 
you can see. The words appear to be made of cloud and 
remain in place for the spell's duration. The words dis-
sipate when the spell ends. A strong wind can disperse 
the clouds and end the spell early. 
SNARE 
1st-level abjuration 
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: Touch 
Components: S, M (25 feet of rope, which the 
spell consumes) 
Duration: 8 hours 
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle 
with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When 
you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle 
becomes a magic trap. 
This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful 
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save 
DC to be discerned. 
The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large 
creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the 
spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dex-
terity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, 
leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground 
or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the 
spell ends. 
A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on 
itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or some-
one else who can reach it can use an action to make an 
Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. 
On a success, the restrained effect ends. 
After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no 
creature is restrained by it. 
SNILLOC'S SNOWBALL SWARM 
2nd-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a piece of ice or a small white 
rock chip) 
Duration: instantaneous 
A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you 
choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius 
sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity 
saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 cold damage on a 
fai led save, or half as much damage on a s uccessful one. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 
ld6 for each slot level above 2nd. 
SOUL CAGE 
6th-level necromancy 
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when a hu-
manoid you can see within 60 feet of you dies 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a tiny silver cage worth 100 gp) 
Duration: 8 hours 
This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and 
traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material com-
ponent. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the 
spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the 
spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can ex-
ploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a 
trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for 
the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While 
a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't 
be revived. 
Steal Life. You can use a bonus action to drain vigor 
from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points. 
Query Soul. You ask the soul a question (no action re-
quired) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you 
can understand regardless of the language used. The 
soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer 
you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is 
no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic. 
Borrow Experience. You can use a bonus action to 
bolster yourself with the soul's life experience, making 
your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with 
advantage. 1f you don't use this benefit before the start of 
your next turn, it is lost. 
Eyes of the Dead. You can use an action to name a 
place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invis-
ible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane 
of existence you're currently on. The sensor remains for 
as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you 
were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and
