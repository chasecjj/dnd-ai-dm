LEFT TO R 1G ... T: DRUNKEN MAS TER, K ENSEI , AN O SUN Sou1. 
MASTER 
During your studies, you were likely under the tutelage 
of a master who imparted to you the precepts of the 
order. Your master was the one most responsible for 
shaping your understanding of the ma rtial arts and your 
attitude toward the world. What sort of person was your 
master, and how did your relationship with your master 
affect you? 
MASTERS 
d6 
Master 
Your master was a t yrant whom you had to defeat 
in single combat to complete your instruction. 
2 
Your master was kindly and taught you to pursue 
the cause of peace. 
3 
Your master was merciless in pushing you to your 
limits. You nearly Jost an eye during one especially 
brutal practice session. 
4 
Your master seemed goodhea rted while tutoring 
you , but betrayed your mo nastery in the end. 
S 
Your master was cold and distant. You suspect that 
the two of you might be related. 
6 
Your master was kind and generous, never critical 
of your progress. Nevertheless, you feel you never 
fully lived up to the expectations placed on you. 
M ONASTIC T RA DITIONS 
At 3rd level, a monk gains the Monastic Tradition fea-
ture. The following options are available to a monk, in 
addition to those offered in the Player's Handbook: the 
Way of the Drunken Master, the Way of the Kensei, and 
the Way of the Sun Soul. 
WAY OF THE DRUNKEN MASTER 
The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students 
to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of 
a drunkard. A drunken master sways, tottering on 
unsteady feet, to present what seems like an incompe-
tent combatant who proves frustrating to engage. The 
drunken master's erratic stumbles conceal a carefully 
executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, 
and retreats. 
A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to 
bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate 
humility to the arrogant, but when battle is joined, the 
drunken master can be a maddening, masterful foe.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES 
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already 
have it. Your martial arts technique mixes combat train-
ing with the precision of a dancer and the a ntics of a 
jeste r. You also gain proficiency with brewer's supplies if 
you don't already have it. 
DRUNKEN TECHNIQUE 
At 3rd level, you learn how to twist a nd turn quickly as 
part of your Flurry of Blows. Whenever you use Flurry 
of Blows, you gain the benefit of the Disengage action, 
and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the 
end of the current turn. 
TIPSY SWAY 
S ta rting at 6th level, you can move in sudden, swaying 
ways. You gain the following benefits. 
Leap to Your Feet. When you're prone, you can stand 
up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half 
your speed. 
Redirect Attack. When a creature misses you with 
a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 ki point as a re-
action to cause that attack to hit one creature of your 
choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 
feet of you. 
DRUNKA RD'S L UCK 
Starting at 11th level, you a lways seem to get a lucky 
bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability 
check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disad-
vantage on the roll, you can spend 2 ki points to cancel 
the disadvantage for that roll. 
INTOXICATED FRENZY 
At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelm-
ing number of attacks against a group of enemies. Whe n 
you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make up to three 
additional attacks with it (up to a total of five Flurry of 
Blows attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows at-
tack targets a different creature this turn. 
CH APTER I I C H ARACTER OPTfONS 
WAY OF THE KENSEI 
Monks of the Way of the Kensei tra in relentlessly with 
their weapons, to the point where the weapon becomes 
an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of 
sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include 
many different weapons. 
A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a cal-
ligrapher or painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever 
the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used to express 
the beauty and precision of the martial arts. That such 
mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side 
effect of intense devotion, practice, a nd study.

PATH OF THE KENSEI 
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your spe-
cial martial arts training leads you to master the use of 
certain weapons. This path also includes instruction in 
the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting. You gain the 
following benefits. 
Kensei Weapons. Choose two types of weapons to 
be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one 
ra nged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any sim-
ple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy a nd specia l 
properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain 
proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have 
it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for 
you. Many of this tradition's features work only with 
your kensei weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 
17th level in this class, you can choose another type of 
weapon- either melee or ranged- to be a kensei weapon 
for you, following the criteria above. 
Agile Parry. If you make an unarmed strike as part of 
the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei 
weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee 
weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of 
your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and 
you a ren't incapacitated. 
Kensei's Shot. You can use a bonus action on your 
turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon 
more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a 
ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra ld4 
damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit un-
til the end of the current turn. 
Way of the Brush. You gain proficiency with your 
choice of calligrapher's supplies or painter's supplies. 
ONE WITH THE BLADE 
At 6th level, you extend your ki into your kensei weap-
ons, granting you the following benefits.
