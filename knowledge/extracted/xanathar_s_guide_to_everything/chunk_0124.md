You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot 
cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each 
creature in that area must make a Constitution saving 
throw. Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants 
and water elementals make this saving throw with dis-
advantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Nonmagical plants in the a rea that aren't creatures, 
s uch as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.

acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage 
Range: Self

The spell captures some of the incoming energy, less-
ening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee 
attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage 
type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time 
you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target 
takes an extra ld6 damage of the triggering type, and 
the spell ends. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
s pell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage in-
creases by ld6 for each slot level above 1st.

ture takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one.

C HAPTER 3 f SPELLS 
if the beast's Intelligence score is 4 or higher. Until the 
spell ends, the link is active while you and the beast are 
within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the 
beast can understand your telepathic messages to it, 
and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions 
and concepts back to you. While the link is active, the 
beast gains advantage on attack rolls against a ny crea-
ture within 5 feet of you that you can see. 
BONES OF THE EARTH 
6th-level transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 
You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places 
on the ground that you can see within ra nge. Each pilla r 
is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet a nd a height of 
up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must 
be wide enough for its diameter, a nd you can target the 
ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or 
smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When 
reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, 
which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-
foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 
5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 
minute to clear by ha nd. 
If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature 
must s ucceed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by 
the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save. 
If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height 
because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the 
pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage a nd is restrained, 
pinched between the pillar a nd the obstacle. The re-
strained creature can use an action to make a Strength 
or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the 
spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no lon-
ger restrained and must either move off the pillar or 
fall off it. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
s pell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two addi-
tional pillars for each slot level above 6th. 
CATAPULT 
1st-level transmutation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: S 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range 
that is n't being worn or carried. The object flies in a 
straight line up to 90 feet io a direction you choose 
before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts 
against a solid surface. If the object would strike a crea-
ture, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
On a failed save, the object strikes the target a nd stops 
moving. When the object strikes something, the object 
and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage. 
At Higher Levels. When you cast this s pell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of 
objects that you can target with this spell increases by 5 
pounds, and the damage increases by ld8, for each slot 
level above 1st.
