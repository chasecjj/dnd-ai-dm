COMPLEX TRAPS 
A complex trap poses multiple dangers to adventurers. 
After a complex trap activates, it remains dangerous 
round after round until the characters avoid it or disable 
it. Some complex traps become more dangerous over 
time, as they accumulate power or gain speed. 
Complex traps are also more difficult to disable than 
simple ones. A single check is not enough. Instead, a se-
ries of checks is required to s lowly disengage the trap's 
components. The trap's effect degrades with each suc-
cessful check until the characters finally deactivate it. 
Most complex traps are designed so that they can be 
disarmed only by someone who is exposed to the trap's 
effect. For example, the mechanism that controls a hall-
way filled with scything blades is on the opposite end 
from the entrance, or a statue that bathes an area in ne-
crotic energy can be disabled only by someone standing 
in the affected area. 
DESCRIBING A COMPLEX TRAP 
A complex trap has all the elements of a simple trap, 
plus special characteristics that make the trap a more 
dynamic threat. 
Level and Threat. A complex trap uses the same level 
and severity designations that a simple trap does. 
Trigger. Just like a simple trap, a complex trap has a 
trigger. Some complex traps have multiple triggers. 
Initiative. A complex trap takes turns as a creature 
does, because it functions over a period of time. Thjs 
part of a trap's description tells whether the trap is slow 
(acts on initiative count 10), fast (acts on initiative count 
20), or very fast (acts on initiative count 20 and also ini-
tiative count 10). A trap always acts after creatures that 
have the same initiative count. 
Active Elements. On a trap's turn, it produces specific 
effects that are detailed in this part of its description. 
The trap might have multiple active elements, a table 
you roll on to determine its effect at random, or options 
for you to choose from. 
Dynamic Elements. A dynamic element is a threat 
that arises or evolves while the trap functions. Usually, 
changes involving dramatic elements take effect at the 
end of each of the trap's turns or in response to the char-
acters' actions. 
Constant Elements. A complex trap poses a threat 
even when it is not taking its turn. The constant ele-
ments describe how these parts of the trap function. 
Most make an attack or force a saving throw against any 
creature that ends its turn within a certain area. 
Countermeasures. A trap can be defeated in a variety 
of ways. A trap's description details the checks or spells 
that can detect or dfaable it. It also specifies what hap-
pens, if anything, on a failed attempt to disable it. 
Disabling a complex trap is like disarming a simple 
trap, except that a complex trap requires more checks. 
It typically takes three successful checks to disable 
one of a complex trap's elements. Many of these traps 
have multiple elements, requiring a lot of work to shut 
down every part of the trap. Usually, a successful check 
reduces a trap element's effectiveness even if it doesn't 
disable the trap. 
CHAPTER 2 I DUNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS 
RUNNING A COMPLEX TRAP 
A complex trap functions in play much like a legendary 
monster. When it is activated, the trap's active elements 
act according to its initiative. On each of its initiative 
counts, after all creatures with that same initiative count 
have acted, the trap's features activate. Apply the effects 
detailed in the trap's description. 
After resolving the effects of the trap's active elements, 
check its dynamic elements to see if anytrung changes 
about the trap. Many complex traps have effects that 
vary during an encounter. A magical aura might do more 
damage the longer it is active, or a swinging blade might 
change which area of a chamber it attacks. 
The trap's constant elements a llow it to have effects 
when it isn't the trap's turn. At the end of each creature's 
turn, look at the trap's constant elements to see if any of 
their effects are triggered. 
EXPERIENCE FOR COMPLEX TRAPS 
Overcoming a complex trap merits an experience point 
award, depending on the danger it poses.judging 
whether a party has overcome a trap requires some 
amount of adjudication. As a rule of thumb, if the char-
acters disable a complex trap or are exposed to its ef-
fects and survive, award them experience points for the 
effort according to the table below.

EXAMPLE COMPLEX TRAPS 
The following complex traps can be used to challenge 
characters or to inspire your own creations. 
PATH OF BLADES 
Complex trap (level 1-4, dangerous threat) 
Hidden within a buried pyramid that marks the location 
of the Lost City of Cynidicea is the tomb of King Alexan-
der and Queen Zenobia. The entrance to their tomb is a 
long hallway riddled with traps, accessible only by cun-
ningly hidden secret doors. The hallway is 20 feet wide 
and 160 feet long. It is mostly clear. After 80 feet, the 
floor is broken and cracked, becoming difficult terrain 
until the 130-foot mark. 
Trigger. This trap activates as soon as a non-undead 
creature enters the hallway, and it remains active while 
any non-undead creature is within the hall. 
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative count 20 and ini-
tiative count 10. 
Active Elements. The Path of Blades includes a set of 
whirling blades along the first 80 feet of the trap, crush-
ing pillars that slam down from the ceiling to the floor 
before rising back up to the ceiling in the next 50 feet, 
and a rune of fear in its final 30 feet. 
Whirling Blades (Initiative 20). The blades attack 
each creature in the first 80 feet of the hallway, with
