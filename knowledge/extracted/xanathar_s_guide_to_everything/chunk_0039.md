If your sorcerer has a supernatural mark, it might be 
one that's easily concealed, or it could be a source of 
pride that you keep on constant display. 
SUPERNATURAL MARKS

Your eyes are an unusual color, such as red. 
You have an extra toe on one foot. 
One of your ears is noticeably larger than the other. 
Your hair grows at a prodigious rate. 
You wrinkle your nose repeatedly while you are 
chewing. 
A red splotch appears on your neck once a day, 
then vanishes after an hour. 
As the world well knows, some sorcerers are better than 
others at controlling their spellcasting. Sometimes a 
wild display of magic gone awry emanates from a sor-
cerer who casts a spell. But even when one's magic goes 
off as planned, the act of casting is often accompanied 
by a telltale sign that makes it clear where that magical 
energy came from. 
When your sorcerer character casts a spell, does the 
effort reveal itself in a sign of sorcery? Is this sign tied to 
your origin or some other aspect of who you are, or is it 
a seemingly random phenomenon?

Your hair and garments are briefly buffeted about, 
as if by a breeze, whenever you call forth a spell. 
If you are standing when you cast a spell, you rise 
six inches into the air and gently float back down. 
Illusory blue flames wreathe your head as you be-
gin your casting, then abruptly disappear.

SORCEROUS ORIGINS 
At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin fea-
ture. The following options are available to a sorcerer, 
in addition to those offered in the Player's Handbook: 
Divine Soul, Shadow Magic, and Storm Sorcery. 
DIVINE SOUL 
Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer 
comes from a divine source that glimmers within the 
soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your 
innate magic might come from a distant but powerful fa. 
milial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ances-
tor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to 
fight in a god's name. Or your birth might align with an 
ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods 
or a chosen vessel of divine magic. 
A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a 
threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who 
commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine 
an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine. 
In some cultures, only those who can claim the power 
of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In 
these lands, ecclesiastical positions a re dominated by a 
few bloodlines and preserved over generations.

DIVINE MAGIC 
Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from 
the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you 
learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 
1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from 
the cleric spell List or the sorcerer spell list. You must 
otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the 
spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you. 
In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your 
divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You 
learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown 
below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count 
against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you 
later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell 
from the cleric spell list.

FAVORED BY THE GODS 
Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. 
If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you 
can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing

the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can't use it 
again until you finish a short or long rest. 
EMPOWERED HEALING 
Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through 
you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or 
an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the 
number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 
sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, 
provided you aren't incapacitated. You can use this fea-
ture only once per turn. 
OTHERWORLDLY WINGS 
Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to 
ma nifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While 
the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. 
The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you 
dismiss them as a bonus action. 
The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature 
determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle 
wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and 
dragonfly wings for neutrality. 
UNEARTHLY RECOVERY 
At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous 
injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than 
half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a num-
ber of hit points equa l to half your hit point maximum. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 
SHADOW MAGIC 
You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic 
comes from the Shadowfell itself. You might trace your 
lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were 
exposed to its fell energy and transformed by it. 
The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over 
your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains 
you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against 
the dark energy that imbues your soul. At your option, 
you can pick from or roll on the Shadow Sorcerer 
Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

You are always icy cold to the touch. 
When you are asleep, you don't appear to breathe 
(though you must still breathe to survive). 
You barely bleed, even when badly injured. 
Your heart beats once per minute. This event 
sometimes surprises you. 
You have trouble remembering that living creatures 
and corpses should be treated differently. 
You blinked. Once. Last week.
