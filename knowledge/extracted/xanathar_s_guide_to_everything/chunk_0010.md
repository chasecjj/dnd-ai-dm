it makes against your spells on your next turn. 
Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do

COLLEGE OF SWORDS 
~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and 
they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. 
Blades perform s tunts s uch as sword swallowing, knife 
throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they 
use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly 
trained and s killed warriors in their own right. 
Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to 
lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe 
as cover for nefar ious deeds such as assassination, rob-
bery, a nd blackmail. Other blades s trike at the wicked, 
bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. 
Most troupes are happy to accept a blade's talent for the 
excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertain-
ers fully trust a blade in their ranks. 
Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have 
often run into trouble that makes maintaining their 
secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or 
engaging in vigila nte jus tice is too great a liability for 
mos t troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these 
blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves' 
guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.
