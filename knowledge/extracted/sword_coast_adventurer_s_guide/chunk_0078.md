the land such that all that remained was a blasted moor. 
It is a rocky wilderness infested with trolls and gobli-
noids and all manner of other dangers for anyone who 
treks across it instead of going around. 
As the name suggests, the High Moor is a raised area 
extending for many miles of heath, lichen-covered out-
croppings, and hidden gullies. Herd animals wander 
the land, from sheep to rock ponies to the occasional 
rothe. These beasts graze without great risk, because 
wolves and other predators that would thin the herds 
are themselves the prey of the trolls and goblinoids 
that otherwise rule the moor. These two-legged threats 
sometimes seed the High Moor with traps, but are nor-
mally occupied with fighting and killing their prey and 
each other. There is something of a cycle to the hunts of 
the High Moor: wolves are killed off by the hobgoblins 
one year, leading to more sheep grazing, which brings 
the trolls out (the local trolls enjoy mutton, it seems), 
which brings intrepid adventurers to deal with the 
growing menace, enabling just enough of the wolves to 
survive that they aren't wiped out completely. 
Human barbarians also inhabit the High Moor, living 
mostly on its western fringes with large herds of sheep 
and goats, the soil being too thin and too poor for farm-
ing. They aren't Uthgardt or related to them, but they 
might have some distant ties to the Northlanders, as 
they seem to be of Illuskan stock. They speak a dialect 
of Illuskan I'd not heard before, and my first meetings 
with them were quite tense and filled with misappre-
hension. However, I came to know people from both 
the Girondi and Belcondi tribes, all of whom acted with 
bravery, honor, and good humor in my presence. Trav-
elers in this region should note that the human tribes 
share the suspicion of magic common among many 
Northlanders, but thankfully it isn't the fanatic hatred 
shown by the Uthgardt. 
There are also some small ore tribes, Redclaw and 
Blue Feather, among them. The humans and goblinoids 
both despise the ores, and my hosts said they allied 
with one another in the past when the ores grew great 
in number. 
0ROGOTH 
For such a large expanse, the High Moor contains few 
known ruins. One such is Orogoth, the former villa of 
a noble family of old Netheril. Local legends say the 
family dabbled in dragon magic, attempting to capture 
those powerful wyrms and acquire their powers. The 
tales differ as to what folly led to the family becom-
ing immolated in its home, but most agree the culprit 
was a dracolich, of all things, residing in the ruin and

defending the family's wealth. The gods only know 
what led .to the creation of such a creature or what 
binds it to this place. The answers-if any there be- lie 
within its lair. 
MISTY FOREST 
West of the High Moor but heavily influenced by it, the 
Misty Forest draws its name from the fog that rolls off 
the heights of the moor to shroud its trees. Melandrach, 
King of the Woods, rules here and holds the forest as 
the exclusive domain of the elves. Though game animals 
roam in plenty, the local humans know well that the 
elves protect them and punish trespassers who poach 
in the forest. Even barbarians know better than to hunt 
here, as they don't wish to draw Melandrach's atten-
tion or ire. 
Travelers who leave the inhabitants of the Misty 
Forest alone, and who build their campfires small and 
solely of fallen branches, are usually permitted to pass, 
so long as the folk of the forest aren't in a foul mood or 
stirred up against outsiders for some other reason. 
SECOMBER 
Just off the High Moor, on the north bank of the 
Delimbiyr near the Unicorn Run, is the small town of 
Secomber, on the border between the North and the set-
tlements of the Western Heartlands. Built over the ruins 
of Hastarl, capital of the ancient kingdom of Athalantar, 
Secomber is a quiet place where fishers and farmers go 
about their work, and local folk hire out to hunt or fish, 
or guide travelers through the area. Skilled guides who 
know the High Moor well, and can navigate its many 
dangers and its local tribes, are common- or appear 
to be, given how often their services are offered. Local 
stonecutters, primarily from a small clan of dwarves, 
excavate pink granite from the rock walls on northern 
edge of the moor. 
RHYMANTHIIN: HIDDEN CITY OF HOPE 
Stories persist that Faer'tel'miir, an ancient city of 
Miyeritar, was restored by High Magic sometime in the 
last century- perhaps even before the Spellplague- up 
on the High Moor. The restored city of dark, smooth 
stone, called Rhymanthiin, or "The Hidden City of 
Hope," appears on no maps, and is reputedly concealed 
by magic or some other artifice. Supposedly only those 
who are worthy, without malice in their hearts, may 
reach it, while others (as the tales have it) "shall not find 
their way there." Such tale-tellers must be few and far 
between, as I know of no one who can rightly claim to 
have seen it, but still the stories seem to have a life of 
their own. 
NAJARA 
Gone are the days when the tales of a kingdom of ser-
pents were rumor and hearsay, stories concocted by 
adventurers and travelers who strayed far off the path 
and somehow managed to escape. It was once easy 
to doubt their veracity, for what nation didn't patrol its 
borders or establish communication (amicable or other-
wise) with other nations? The stories of naga and yuan-ti 
were easy enough to believe, for this area had always 
hosted such things. But a nation of such creatures? 
As we now know, the kingdom of Najara, as pro-
claimed by the serpents that live within, lies along the 
northern edge of the Trade Way, northeast of Boareskyr 
Bridge and southeast of the High Moor. The Winding 
Water flows through these lands, and its other main geo-
graphical features are the Serpent Hills, the Marsh of 
Chelimber, and the Forest ofWyrms. 
I discovered for myself the truth of Najara, the King-
dom of Serpents, when a sage in Baldur's Gate hired me 
to guide him, his apprentices, and a handful of adventur-
ers to some ruins in the eastern edges of the High Moor. 
I will forever regret accepting that commission, for not 
only did half the adventurers turn out to be greedy swine 
intent on plundering the ruins rather than allowing the 
sage his study, but their idiocy awoke an ancient spirit 
that caused most of the group to drop off into a deathly 
sleep while it consumed their souls. Since I am unaf-
fected by magics that force slumber, I escaped, along 
with a half-elf among the apprentices to the sage. The 
spirit chased us across the moors relentlessly, forcing 
us into the tunnels beneath the Serpent Hills, where we 
were taken prisoner by yuan-ti patrolling the borders of 
their domain. The half-elf was hauled away in slaver's 
chains, but for some reason I was taken to the court of 
Jarant, the Serpent King. A brief account of that experi-
ence follows. 
Ancient and evil, the spirit nagaJarant rules the king-
dom by virtue of his personal power and thanks to the 
aid of the Marlspire of Najara, a thin silver crown that 
has protective and other magical abilities. Though he 
still preferred to remain utterly isolated from the outside 
world at the time when I met him, ten years ago the 
Dark Serpent began sending ambassadors to neighbor-
ing kingdoms to warn them about the consequences 
of interfering in Najaran matters. Though I saw the 
king for but a moment,Jarant's influence in his realm 
is undeniable, for his name is spoken reverently by all
