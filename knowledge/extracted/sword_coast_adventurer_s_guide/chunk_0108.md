CHAPTER 4: CLASSES 
HE TWELVE CLASSES PRESENTED IN THE 
Player's Handbook are all found in the For-
gotten Realms. The material in this chap-
ter describes the place of those classes in 
Faerun, particularly on the Sword Coast 
and in the North. The chapter also in-
cludes new class-feature options for most 
of the classes, as well as some new spells. 
BARBARIANS 
CLOSEST TO THE DARK ELVES, PwENT LOWERED HIS 
head, with its long helmet spike, and impaled one elf 
through the chest, blasting through the fme mesh of draw 
armor easily and brutally. The second draw managed to 
deflect the next battlerager's charge, turning the helmet 
spike aside with both his swords. But a mailed fist, the 
knuckles devilishly spiked with barbed points, caught the 
draw under the chin and tore a gaping hole in his throat. 
Fighting.for breath, the draw managed to score two nasty 
hits on his opponent's back, but those two strikes did little in 
the face of the flurry launched by the wild-eyed dwarf. 
-R.A . Salvatore, Siege of Darkness 
Many of the lands of the Sword Coast and the North are 
savage, where day-to-day survival is a struggle. Such 
lands breed hardy tribes and fierce warriors, such as the 
Reghed and Uthgardt barbarians of the North and the 
seafaring Northlanders of the Moonshae Isles and the 
northernmost reaches of the Sword Coast. 
Barbarians of these lands are most often humans or 
half-ores, occasionally half-elves born of contact be-
tween savage human tribes and the elves of the North 
or Western Heartlands, or tieflings from tribes known 
to consort with fiends. Dwarf barbarians are famed and 
feared warriors among the fiercely proud clans that have 
reclaimed territories like Mithril Hall and Gautlgrym. 
Barbarians of most other races hail from warmer south-
ern lands, rather than the Savage North, although south-
ern foundlings are sometimes adopted in the North and 
raised by tribes there. 
PRIMAL PATHS 
Barbarians in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Primal Path options, in addition to those in the Player's 
Handbook. Reghed and North lander barbarians tend 
to follow the Path of the Berserker, while Uthgardt bar-
barians are nearly always followers of the Path of the 
Totem Warrior. 
PATH OF THE BATTLERAGER 
Known as Kuldjargh (literally "axe idiot") in Dwarvish, 
battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and 
take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in 
wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves 
into combat, striking with their body itself and giving 
themselves over to the fury of battle. 
RESTRICTION: DWARVES ONLY 
Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. 
The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven soci-
ety and culture. 
Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the cam-
paign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. 
It might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's ver-
sion of the Realms. 
BATTLERAGER ARMOR 
When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the 
ability to use spiked armor (see the "Spiked Armor" 
sidebar) as a weapon. 
While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, 
you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon 
attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 
feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal ld4 pierc-
ing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the 
attack and damage rolls. 
Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grap-
ple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your 
grapple check succeeds. 
RECKLESS ABANDON 
Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack 
while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to 
your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish 
if any of them are left when your rage ends. 
BATTLERAGER CHARGE 
Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as 
a bonus action while you are raging. 
SPIKED RETRIBUTION 
Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of 
you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 
piercing damage if you are raging, aren't incapacitated, 
and are wearing spiked armor. 
PATH OF THE TOTEM WARRIOR 
If you follow the Path of the Totem Warrior from the 
Player's Handbook, you have access to the options pre-
sented here. 
TOTEM SPIRIT 
These options are available to you when you choose a 
totem animal at 3rd level. 
SPIKED ARMOR 
Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by 
dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered 
with spikes that are usually made of metal. 
Cost: 75 gp 
AC: 14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2) 
Stealth: Disadvantage 
Weight: 45 lb.
