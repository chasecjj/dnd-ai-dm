Adbar's foundries, mines, and other operations working 
at all times. Near the wheel is the Hall of Moradin's 
Forge, a place of worship that reminds every dwarf of 
the Soul Forger's strength and enduring protection. One 
can't help but feel safe in its presence, and a true dwarf 
is home in the warmth of Moradin's shadow. 
Given the current state of the surface lands around 
the citadel, it is no surprise that Adbarran are even 
more suspicious than usual of caravans and visitors that 
approach the city by means of an underground route. 
One such road arrives from the west, connecting Adbar 
to Mithra! Hall and Mirabar through the ancient tun-
nels of Old Delzoun. Another tunnel leads south from 
Adbar to meet the Lowroad, which connects the ruins of 
Ascore in the east to Citadel Felbarr in the west. 
No matter where they come from, all roads leading to 
Adbar converge so that all travelers must confront the 
great pair of iron doors known as the Caravan Door. 
Like the rest of Citadel Adbar, this gate has never been 
breached. Mention the idea of that happening to an 
Adbarran dwarf, if you're looking to get a laugh. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
THE DIRGE OF DELZOUN 
The tale of the great North kingdom of the shield 
dwarves, the Dirge of Delzoun takes more than a day 
to sing in its entirety. The song recounts the history of 
Delzoun, from its founding m illen nia ago to the dis-
persa l of its cities and the settlement of the successor 
realms of dwarves in the North. It is performed only in 
Dwa rvis h, and no known written copies have ever been 
reported. Only a privileged few non-dwarves have ever 
heard the Dirge in its entirety, and dwarf bards who want 
to perform this epic must demonstrate great ski ll in both 
singing and history. 
The current dirgekeeper is Ollyn Grimtongue of Citadel 
Felbarr, who was appointed by King Emerus Warcrown a 
century ago, and is the only dwarf permitted to add new 
lines to the ballad. It is believed that, now that Emerus has 
gone to the Halls of Morad in, Grimtongue is preparing a 
stanza honoring his former liege as a hero who rivals the 
champions of Old Delzoun. 
CITADEL FELBARR 
Among the eldest and grandest of the Delzoun holds, 
Citadel Felbarr was built more than three thousand 
years ago- a span of time beyond the ability of younger 
races to comprehend. With great wealth, obtained 
through profitable trade with Netheril and some of the 
older human settlements of the North, the dwarves 
forged themselves a mighty fortress. 
Like most dwarven settlements, Felbarr was built 
around mining. With the fall of Netheril, the reduction 
of trade along the Lowroad, and signs that the mines 
beneath the city were reaching the end of their useful-
ness, the Felbarran abandoned the citadel after nearly 
two millennia, whereupon a force out of Silverymoon 
occupied the fortress shortly thereafter. Within half a 
century, the ores had come to realize the weakness of 
the much smaller garrison, and Felbarr was taken by 
the savages following a four-month siege. The ores gave 
the place their tribal name, and the Citadel of Many 
Arrows stood as a fortress for ores for more than three 
hundred years. 
The recent story of Citadel Felbarr is the story of my 
fallen friend, King Emerus Warcrown. In 1367 DR, 
Emerus led a force of dwarves to seize on the advantage 
when, to our surprise and delight, another ore horde 
assaulted the ores inside the Citadel of Many Arrows. 
Biding his time until the invaders broke down the gates, 
Emerus vanquished both tribes of ores and reclaimed 
the citadel for the dwarves. After a first, brutal winter, 
Citadel Felbarr was restored: its forges were relit, and 
the sound of dwarven hammers began ringing through 
its halls once again. It was a proud time when we 
welcomed the following summer with Felbarr back in 
dwarf hands. 
In the most recent war, the ores again took Citadel 
Felbarr, but with the help of King Bruenor Battleham-
mer and an alliance of dwarves from across the North, 
King Emerus again retook Felbarr, slaying every ore 
that managed to enter the city and the tunnels below. 
The grateful king and his loyal warriors then agreed 
to accompany Bruenor to Gauntlgrym, and there aided 
him in reclaiming that ancient city as well, but Emerus 
was mortally wounded in the effort. Bruenor honored
