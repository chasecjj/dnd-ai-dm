basis of the famous scrimshaw that is sold as far south 
as Calimshan and farther east than I care to consider. 
The bones are also used to make all manner of small, 
sturdy tools: fish hooks, arrowheads, sewing needles, 
buttons, and more. Each town on the lakes has its own 
fleet of fishing boats, and the towns carefully divide the 
lakes to protect the population and the delicate balance 
between the communities. 
Independent-minded folk who come to Ten-Towns are 
discouraged from striking out on their own, and when 
they do, they often fail, either due to the dangers of the 
waters, being blocked out of the best fishing areas, or 
simply being refused trade by the scrimshanders, whose 
wares are expensive. Icewind Dale is a place where 
cooperation is essential for survival, and ignoring that 
fact can leave one quite alone in a time of need. 
Where nine of the Ten-Towns survive primarily on 
fishing, Bryn Shander lives on trade, making it the place 
to visit when you come here. The walls keep the town 
safe from barbarians who raid the area and the beasts 
of the tundra, and the packing in of its people means 
Bryn Shander is also warmer than the other towns, both 
literally and in terms of the welcome you receive. 
I have visited only a few of the other towns, and while 
they have their quirks and charms, they are mostly what 
you might expect: fishing villages at the edge of frigid 
waters in a frozen waste. Certainly, there is trade to be 
done, coin to be made, and intrigue to be investigated 
in even in the smallest of these communities (which 
can number as few as a hundred souls). The only other 
point of interest is the town of Targos, on Maer Dualdon, 
which has grown rapidly and is threatening to burst 
the bounds of its protective wall, and thus has a hum of 
opportunity about it. 
REGHED BARBARIANS 
Ten-Towns isn't the only community in Icewind Dale. 
Tribes of human barbarians called Reghed also operate 
in the area. Hunters and raiders who value strength and 
devotion to their ancestral heroes, they claim a great 
many heroes among their honored dead, including some 
who were responsible for the safety of Ten-Towns, Ice-
wind Dale, and beyond. A Reghed camp is made up of 
a large ring of hide tents, able to be broken down and 
transported as the Reghed move to keep up with the 
herds of reindeer they depend on for food and clothing. 
THE DWARVES 
Dwarves still live in the mines of Kelvin's Cairn, but in 
fewer numbers than they once did, and with less influ-
ence than they had on the rest of Icewind Dale a century 
or two ago. The dwarves here claim their continued 
allegiance to Clan Battlehammer of Mithra! Hall, even 
though they returned to the colder north when they dis-
covered their ancient home no longer suited them. Bryn 
Shander serves them as a trading post, allowing them 
to keep humans and other strangers away from their 
mines, which are some distance away in the shadow 
of the Cairn. The dwarves send a representative to the 
council of speakers that governs Ten-Towns, but have no 
say in their proceedings except to declare acceptance or 
refusal of the decisions of the human gathering. 
THE UNDERDARK 
Do YOU KNOW WHAT IT JS TO BE A SLAVE? To FEEL THE 
crack of a whip, the venom of a draw priestess's snake-headed 
lash, the weight of a burden you can't possibry lift after so 
much toil? No, you don't. So close your mouth and openyour 
eyes and ears, and dip your quill. 
- Oshgir the half-ore, to Kimitar Thaeless, 
glyphscribe of Deneir 
Known by many as the Realms Below, the vast, miles-
deep network of caverns, caves, and underground 
waterways called the Underdark is home to many 
strange creatures and even stranger societies. No one 
is quite sure the extent of this massive ecosystem, 
except to say that it reaches at least the breadth of the 
continent, and that most creatures are fully capable of 
surviving their entire lives within it, provided they can 
find enough food and safety to do so. Breathable air is 
plentiful, and clean water can be found. Beyond that, 
most surface folk only have the tales of adventurers, the 
survivors of attacks, and the occasional escaped captive 
to describe the horrors lurking below the surface. 
What follows are portions of the tale told by Oshgir, a 
half-ore warrior who was captured by a duergar raiding 
party, sold to a Zhentarim agent, captured by drow, and 
then escaped his captivity by killing an overseer and 
fleeing to Blingdenstone. This account was recorded by 
a traveling scribe of Deneir named Kimitar Thaeless 
and submitted to the library at Candlekeep. Most don't 
believe that a half-ore was quite so eloquent in his tell-
ing, and thus contend that the scribe embellished the 
tale somewhat. 
CAPTURE 
It's impossible to describe the shame of a hardened 
warrior driven to his knees by a half-dozen duergar that 
have just slain his fellows. Never mind that we were 
asleep and unarmored at the time, or that I was able to 
take four of them down before an axe cut the strength 
from my leg. I was shackled and gagged, my wound 
wrapped in a bandage tight enough to stop the bleeding 
and numb my leg, as the gray pests laughed and spouted 
jokes at me, and then forced me to walk until I lost con-
sciousness. When next I awoke, there was no longer a 
sky overhead. 
GRACKLSTUGH 
After days of walking in the deep, dark places beneath 
the surface, I was led, in heavy chains, to Gracklstugh, 
on the shores of the Darklake. I was set to work almost 
immediately at a forge, to pump bellows, heft ingots, 
and carry barrels of quenching oil. The place is called 
the City of Blades, for good reason: the fine steel of the 
duergar is impressive, considering the quality of the iron 
they were starting with. Hammering, refining, and care-
ful polishing gave the metal the strength and sleekness 
necessary, and diligent sharpening added wicked edges 
to many of the blades I handled.
