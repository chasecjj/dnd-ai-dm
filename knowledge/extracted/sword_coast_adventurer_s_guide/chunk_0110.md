are the singers of the songs and sagas that fire the blood 
of warriors in battle, and composers of the new songs 
and sagas relating the mighty deeds of heroes and vil-
lains. However, spellcasting is taboo among Reghed and 
Norhtlanders unless it is considered a gift of their gods. 
Characters with the bard class who rise to prominence 
among these folk must align themselves with their clan's 
priests and shamans or risk being outcast. Most skalds 
are members of the College of Valor, as described in the 
Bard College class feature in the Player's Handbook. 
THE HARPERS 
Bards in the North and the Dalelands benefit from the 
existence of the Harpers, that legendary society recruit-
ing bards and other independent agents to struggle 
against the forces of evil. Even though most bards in the 
region aren't Harpers (and many who are don't advertise 
that fact), common folk in the North often behave as if 
all bards are legendary wandering heroes, and are as 
likely to ask a bard for the solution to a problem trou-
bling their community as they are a wandering fighter 
or wizard. This reputation cuts both ways, however, as 
some enemies of the Harpers suspiciously assume any 
humble minstrel might secretly be a Harper agent. 
BARDIC COLLEGES 
In addition to the tradition of apprenticing with a master 
bard, the Sword Coast has some bardic colleges where 
masters teach students the bardic arts. They hark back 
to the great bardic colleges of the distant past, particu-
larly the seven elder colleges: Fochlucan, Mac-Fuirmidh, 
Doss, Canaith, Cli, Anstruth, and Ollamh. These seven 
are said to be the origin of the instrument of the bards, 
each of which is named after one of the colleges. See 
chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for the game 
statistics of these magic instruments. 
Long ago, bards who sought the rank of master bard 
attended each of the elder colleges, seeking to learn its 
musical and magical secrets. Traditionally, the colleges 
were attended in the order given above, starting with Fo-
chlucan. That tradition fell when the colleges went into 
decline, but some bards dream of restoring it. 
COLLEGE OF FOCHLUCAN 
The original College of Fochlucan once stood on the 
northeastern edge of Silverymoon. Many years after it 
closed its doors, the site was reopened as Ultrumm's 
Music Conservatory. The conservatory later moved to 
Southbank, and the House of the Harp occupied the 
college's original location under the guidance of Master 
Bard Fore!! "Flamebeard" Luekuan, who sought to re-
vive the ancient traditions and teachings of Fochlucan. 
Years of cultivation and support from Silverymoon, as 
well as the Harpers, yielded a faculty able to revive the 
college, and the House of the Harp adopted the Fochlu-
can name once again. Most of its bards study and prac-
tice the methods of the College of Lore, as described in 
the Bard College class feature in the Player's Handbook. 
The College of Fochlucan is naturally allied with the 
Harpers, although its master bards are careful to stress 
that its mission is separate from that of the Harpers. 
COLLEGE OF NEW OLAMN 
Housed in two Cliffride villas overlooking the sea near 
Waterdeep, the College of New Olamn is a prestigious 
bardic college established in the Year of the Staff (1366 
DR) by wealthy Waterdhavian patrons and named for 
the old College of Ollamh. Students of the college un-
dergo training in their chosen instruments, along with 
rigorous practice in memorization and the study of 
ancient songs, sagas, and history. Most bards of New 
Olamn belong to the College of Lore, as described in the 
Bard College class feature in the Player's Handbook. 
The Cliffride, a gravel path up Mount Waterdeep's 
northern spur, is used to bring goods to the college, 
but most visitors and students use the Mount Melody 
Walk- a tunnel through the mountain itself-to reach it. 
The tunnel regularly resounds with music, thanks to the 
Neverending String of Pearls, an ongoing concert where 
bardic students perform in a small alcove in the tunnel, 
which carries and echoes their music.
