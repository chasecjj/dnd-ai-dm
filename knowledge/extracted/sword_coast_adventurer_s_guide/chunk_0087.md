is a common practice, a seemingly accepted means of 
gaining the favor of one of the High Captains to obtain 
fishing rights, earning an advantageous decision from 
the Magistrates, or having a business rival or undesired 
suitor arrested, accosted, or roughed up. 
Given its status as the harbor that feeds the goods of 
Mirabar to the Sword Coast, bridging the coast with 
the utter north, and offers the only convenient crossing 
of the River Mirar for many miles, Luskan makes con-
siderable coin as a crossroads. Merchants wishing to 
avoid Luskan can choose to use the Blackford Crossing, 
some thirty miles upstream, eventually connecting with 
the Blackford Road on the northern bank, but the savvy 
know that Luskan's Ships control the cable-guided 
ferries at the crossing, and demand tolls based on the 
size and contents of the goods being ferried across. 
The Blackford Road still bears the ancient marks of the 
dwarven realm of Gharraghaur, reminding travelers of 
whose wealth sustains the region. 
North of the city, the Northern Means heads up 
toward Icewind Dale. Not many take this route without 
purpose, but scrimshaw from the dale finds its way into 
Luskan, where those who would purchase it can do so 
without going any farther into the frozen terrain. 
The north side of the city, known as North Bank, 
is devoted almost entirely to warehouses, caravan 
yards, and workspace. It includes the Mirabar Shield, 
the fortified compound that represents Mirabar's 
trading interest in Luskan. Mirabar uses it as a base 
to trade with the Sword Coast and the islands of the 
Trackless Sea. 
The main city stands on the southern side of the River 
Mirar. North of Reaver's Run is the Reach, where most 
of the homes and smaller businesses are located. South 
of the Run are the slums, the "bad" area of town. Near 
the slums is the Captain's Close, where the residences 
of High Captains Taerl and Suljack stand, but the area is 
otherwise quite poor. 
THE ISLA NDS 
Five islands stand in the bay formed by the River Mirar 
and are claimed by Luskan: 
Blood Island is filled with Ships' soldiers tasked with 
guarding the city; it holds a guard tower, barracks, an 
armory, and little else of interest. 
Closeguard Island is the home of High Captain Kurth. 
• Cutlass Island has two rocky heights split by a peb-
ble-strewn beach. The southern peak is surmounted

by the Sea Tower, where Luskan's first pirates built 
their stronghold, while the northern one is home to 
the Hosttower of the Arcane and the stables it shares 
with Ship Kurth. 
Fang Island has no inhabitants, and is named for its 
propensity for destroying vessels swept down the 
River Mirar. 
Harbor Arm Island is a tall spire sheltering Whitesails 
Harbor from the worst of the storms and waves that 
wash in from the south. 
THE BRIDGES 
The North and South Banks are spanned by three 
bridges: the Upstream Span, from the South Bank 
straight to the North Gate; Dalath's Span, the middle 
bridge with a name none can place in legend, and 
Harbor Cross, split between the Short Span that runs 
from the South Bank to Blood Island, and the Long 
Span that continues on to North Bank. Only Ship 
members and those authorized by a High Captain may 
traverse Harbor Cross. 
Dark Arch connects South Bank with Closeguard 
Island, and only members of Ship Kurth and the 
Arcane Brotherhood may cross that span unchallenged. 
The same is true of Sword Bridge, which crosses 
from Closeguard Island to Cutlass Island. Although 
Closeguard Island is officially unguarded, it's still true 
that only members of the Arcane Brotherhood or Ship 
Kurth are expected to be there, so anyone out of place is 
aggressively questioned about their presence. 
THE ARCANE BROTHERHOOD 
In the last decade or so, two great changes have come 
over Luskan. The first was the plague that crippled the 
gangs that had controlled the city, allowing the High 
Captains to reclaim the power they had long held in

OF THE ARCANE 
BROTHERHOOD 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
Luskan. The other, far more sudden, was the return of 
the Arcane Brotherhood and its five-spired tower. A few 
years ago, the ruined Hosttower of the Arcane began 
regenerating its damaged stone, climbing into the sky 
once more. Shortly thereafter, mages of the Arcane 
Brotherhood emerged, almost immediately began 
cleansing the Luskar ruins of undead, and fought off 
a dragon menacing the city. Cheered by the citizens, 
they swore to keep themselves out of the politics of the 
High Captains and the city at large, but the notion that 
powerful wizards closely aligned with one another can 
truly remain neutral is laughable to anyone familiar with 
such things. 
Now, the Arcane Brotherhood again walks the streets 
of Luskan, marked by the distinctive colors and patterns 
of their cloaks. From a distance, these cloaks all bear 
the same cut and silhouette, but each wizard of the 
Hosttower chooses a color or a design, and a moniker 
to match it. The leadership of the Arcane Brotherhood 
is the archmage and the four overwizards of the other 
spires of the Hosttower: 
• Cashaan the Red, Archmage Arcane 
• Zelenn the White, Overwizard of the West 
• Jendrick the Blue, Overwizard of the South 
• Teyva the Gray, Overwizard of the East 
• Druette the Raven, Overwizard of the North 
Other notable members of the Brotherhood include 
Vaelish the Brown and Maccath the Crimson. 
ICEWIND DALE 
Go far enough north, and you will come to the moun-
tains rightly called the Spine of the World. Turn west 
and go toward the S ea of Moving Ice, and you might 
eventually come upon one of the scattered communities 
of Icewind Dale. You can also travel up the ever-narrow-
ing road from Luskan called the Northern Means, and 
eventually come upon the frozen tundra beyond. 
Why travel so far? Well, if you're like many who've 
drifted up there from the south, it is because an easier 
life doesn't suit you, you're running from something, or 
you just don't fit in anywhere else. 
TuN-TOWNS 
Coming up the hard road from the south, the first thing 
you'll see is Kelvin's Cairn, a great mountain scarred 
by a crack down its southwestern face. Even in high 
summer, its peak is capped in snow and ice. In the 
mountain's southern shadow is Bryn Shander, the larg-
est, most populous, and most fortified of the Ten-Towns 
of Icewind Dale. Ten-Towns is a grouping of communi-
ties clustered around the three lakes of the area: Maer 
Dualdon, from which the Shaengarne River flows down 
toward Iron master; Lac Dinneshere to the east, whose 
waters are nearly always cold enough to kill; and Red-
waters, named for an old battle between rival fisherfolk 
that left the waters bloody. 
Ten-Towns thrives on fishing and trade, both endeav-
ors reliant on the knucklehead trout of Icewind Dale's 
lakes. Without these fish, the people of Ten-Towns 
would starve, but there would also be little for them to 
barter or sell. The ivory-like bones of these fish are the
