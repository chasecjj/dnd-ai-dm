even during seasons Jess suitable for travel, merchant 
caravans cross the bridge and pilgrims come to pay 
homage, ~ll beneath the protective gaze of the paladins 
of Elturgard stationed at nearby Fort Tamai. 
FORTTAMAL 
For many years, a ruined keep on the southern bank 
dubbed Bridgefort served as the campground for cara-
vans passing over the bridge. Whether going north or 
south, caravan masters could anticipate a safe rest within 
the grassy space enclosed by the ruined walls, sharing 
the duties of keeping watch with other travelers. 
Then in the midst of a crisis of leadership in distant 
Elturel, one of the heirs apparent for the post of High 
Observer, a paladin named Tamai Thent, went missing 
with her entire retinue near the bridge. Although an 
investigation was undertaken, no sign of Tamai or any of 
the others was discovered. Thavus Kreeg, Tamal's rival 
for the post, was elevated to the post of High Observer 
soon after, and one of his first declarations was that 
Bridgefort be rebuilt and given a new name in honor of 
lost Tamai. 
A flurry of activity occurred around Boareskyr Bridge 
at that time, with the soldiers of Elturgard making fre-
quent patrols of the road and surrounding lands while 
Fort Tamai was being constructed. Today things are fairly 
quiet at the bridge. The tradition of caravans camping 
at the bridge and pilgrims visiting it continues, but now 
people stay in a caravan ground around a small village 
that has grown up outside the fort. 
Activity around the area is overseen by a curious mix of 
Companions of Elturgard. The Companions- all paladins 
of gods such as Tyr, Torm, Helm, and Amaunator- tend to 
be either young firebrands or grizzled veterans content to 
sit by a fire. Many of the veterans have been stationed at 
Fort Tamai since it was constructed, and they have fam-
ilies that live in the village outside its walls. Their more 
youthful counterparts come from all over Elturgard, but 
all seem to have been assigned to Fort Tamai after some 
act of insubordination. Perhaps it is hoped that time out 
on the frontier with their more experienced counterparts 
will cool some of the young Companions' zeal. 
Certainly some of the young Companions I've spoken 
with see their post as a punishment. Boareskyr Bridge is 
far from the rest of Elturgard, and the caravans that camp 
at Fort Tamai never seemed to need such a robust guard 
before. Even the relative nearness of Najara seems to 
provide little reason for so many of Elturgard's mightiest 
defenders to be squandered on such a trivial task. For 
their part, the elder Companions talk of fulfilling duties 
and following orders, but to me they seemed too content. 
A paladin should have drive. They have been granted 
the power of the gods for a reason, and surely that reason 
can't be to stand guard while merchants sleep. Then 
again, the High Observer is, by all reports, a wise and 
effective ruler. Perhaps he perceives threats at Boares-
kyr Bridge that I can't. Najara has been more active of 
late, despite its quiet exterior, I assure you. Dragonspear 
Castle to the north was once again the source of an infer-
nal incursion. And maybe there is something sinister 
about this place where a god of murder died and a god of 
lies is honored. 
For my part, I sympathize with the young firebrands, 
and I counseled those to whom I spoke to look to the 
skies. In the time of Cyric's legendary battle with Bhaal, 
pegasi dwelt nearby. The magical creatures are said to 
favor those of pure heart and even allow themselves to 
be ridden by such folk when the cause is just. That favor 
might never be bestowed on the young paladins, but I'm 
sure the thought will provide them with some pleasant 
daydreams. 
CANDLE KEEP 
The great keep never fails to take my breath away: it 
stands on a volcanic crag a hundred or so feet from the 
coastline, a fiat-topped spur of rough stone out in the 
midst of the surging sea. Imagine, if you can, the top of 
this crag hemmed in entirely by a tall wall. This wall is 
interrupted by several towers all the way around, and it 
encloses a large space from which even more of these 
same towers rise. Those who have seen this vista from 
above have said that it looks like nothing so much as 
a cake decorated with too many candles. The mist of 
sea-spray fills the air nearest the western walls, and in 
winter, this moisture can cause treacherous build-ups 
of ice. Sometimes entire towers along the western edge 
of the keep have to be abandoned for the season, they 
become so overtaken by frost. 
From the center rises the largest and thickest tower 
of Candlekeep. If the other towers are well-wrought 
branches and blossoms, then this surely is the bole 
of the tree: strong, massive, and rising well above the 
perimeter structures. About the central keep a garden 
spirals in rising steps, and those lucky enough to enter 
the library proper do so by passing around and up 
through this green space to the keep's main door. How-
ever, most folk who visit Candlekeep see this structure 
only from the courtyard east of it, where the facilities for 
arriving scholars lie. 
The only gate into Candlekeep stands at the end of 
the Way of the Lion, which is the only road that provides 
access to and from the outside world. The route extends 
from Beregost, leagues away, and winds a lonely path 
out on the peninsula where Candlekeep stands. 
THE GREAT LIBRARY 
Candlekeep is the largest repository of lore and writings 
in all the Realms (although my scholarly kin in Evereska 
don't like being reminded of that). It was once the home 
of the great prophet Ala undo the Seer, and within its 
walls were written the Prophecies of Alaundo. Its vaults, 
it is said, contain hidden knowledge enough to make any 
person with the ability to discover and absorb it all pow-
erful beyond compare. The problem with doing that, of 
course, is the same as with secrets in any other location: 
one must know that a secret exists before its details can 
be sussed out. 
To that end, Candlekeep's vast library is something of a 
defense in and of itself: for every bit of hidden lore of poten-
tially great power that lies within, there are thousands of 
inconsequential recipes, old songs, bits of history, journals 
of Jong-dead folk, and myriad other pieces of writing of no 
lasting importance save to the monks of this place, and the 
sages who come seeking such trifles.
