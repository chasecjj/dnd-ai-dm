As with the spirits in the Player's Handbook, the op-
tions here require a physical object incorporating some 
part of the totem beast, and you might acquire minor 
physical attributes associated with your totem spirit, 
such as a prominent nose if you have an elk totem spirit 
or catlike eyes if you have a tiger totem spirit. 
Also, your totem spirit might be an animal similar to 
one listed here but more suitable to your homeland, such 
as a horse or stag, rather than an elk, or a lion, panther, 
or other big cat, rather than a tiger. 
Elk. While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy ar-
mor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit 
of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift. 
Tiger. While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long 
jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. 
The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps. 
ASPECT OF THE BEAST 
These options are available to you when you choose a 
totem animal at 6th level. 
Elk. Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is 
doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions 
while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not inca-
pacitated (see chapter 8 in the Player's Handbook for 
more information about travel pace). The elk spirit helps 
you roam far and fast. 
Tiger. You gain proficiency in two skills from the fol-
lowing list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. 
The cat spirit hones your survival instincts. 
TOTEMIC ATTUNEMENT 
These options are available to you when you choose a 
totem animal at 14th level. 
Elk. While raging, you can use a bonus action during 
your move to pass through the space of a Large or 
smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a 
Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength bo-
nus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone 
and take bludgeoning damage equal to ld12 +your 
Strength modifier. 
Tiger. While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet 
in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right 
before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can 
use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon 
attack against it. 
BARDS 
Bards hold a special place of responsibility and respect 
in the Forgotten Realms. They are bearers of news, gos-
sip, and messages in their travels from place to place, 
in addition to being living storehouses of history and 
folklore. Bards know a great deal, and they tend to be 
willing to share what they know, or at least barter for it. 
The arrival of a renowned bard is a special occasion, 
akin to the visit of a dignitary. A bard can reasonably 
expect at least a hot supper and a clean place to sleep 
from a local landlord or inn in exchange for a few songs 
or stories. A noble might host a bard in fine style- while 
also being careful to guard any secrets the noble's 
household doesn't want retold or sung across Faerun. 
Not all wandering performers are true bards, nor are 
all bards inclined to sing for their supper, although most 
will, given the need. Bards literally have magic to them, 
and the powers they command through their perfor-
mance and lore earns them additional respect. 
In the Savage North, singers and storytellers called 
skalds are keepers of the history and great legends of 
the Northlanders and the Reghed. These warrior-poets
