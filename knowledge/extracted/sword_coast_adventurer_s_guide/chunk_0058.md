no amount of money Mintarn could offer that would 
sweeten the deal. 
I like Mintarn. It has cozy inns, and they make a 
brilliant green wine unique to their island. But, there 
are safer harbors during the current storm. Maybe in 
another decade or two I'll try Mintarn again. 
In the case that you visit, here are a few other things 
you should know of Min tarn. 
Every five or six years, a new tyrant- yes, that's what 
they call themselves- emerges on Mintarn, ruling the 
island kingdom in the name of preserving its status 
as a neutral ground and a free port. A few years ago, 
Her Tyrancy was Bloeth Embuirhan, the supposed 
great-granddaughter of a tyrant from a century ago. 
She ruled the island through its most prosperous 
days, but odds are that the folk of Mintarn (and maybe 
herself as well, if she has her wits bout her) wants 
someone else on the throne now. 
Despite its open harbors and many fine establish-
ments, Mintarn remains a loosely settled island. There 
are farms and homesteads, to be sure, but also wide, 
open spaces between them, and enough land that 
anyone could make a small living if so inclined. 
SKADAURAK 
The Red Rage of Mintarn dwells in this mountain that 
rises from the sea north of Min tarn. I've never heard of 
any treasure hunters making it out alive, but those who 
give tribute to Hoondarrh say they sail into a sea cave 
and leave it on a sandy beach within. More caves are 
said to lead out from that bay, one even going straight 
up into the ceiling. Sometimes the tribute carriers can 
hear Hoondarrh's breathing from one of the caves: great 
inhalations, exhalations, and deep rumbles of slumber. 
When they can't hear such noises, you might think folk 
of Mintarn would be inclined to explore Skadaurak, but 
as it was explained to me, the lack of the dragon snoring 
might mean he is away hunting somewhere, but it could 
just as easily mean he is present, watching, and holding 
his breath. 
THE MOONSHAES 
Cloaked in mists, the rocky cliffs of the Moonshae Isles 
rise high above the surf of the Sea of Swords, their tops 
clothed in ancient forests. The Moonshaes lie due west 
from Mintarn- and Baldur's Gate, and Candlekeep, and 
even Arnn, for that matter: this great stretch of islands 
is nearly half as long as the Sword Coast, enclosing the 
Sea of Moonshae. 
On the southern isles live the Ffolk, humans ruled by 
their High King, Derid Kendrick, from the fortress of 
Caer Callidyr on Alaron. The Ffolk worship a goddess 
they call the Earthmother; her druids gather in sacred 
groves on the islands. Some of these groves hold moon-
wells, magical pools that the druids say the goddess 
uses as her windows onto the world. 
The northern isles are the territory of the Northland-
ers, who spread south from Ruathym to settle here,
