Lantan drowned, or so they say. Four ship captains of 
my acquaintance claim to have seen it one moment, and 
then not seen it the next, and sailed straight through its 
former location as though it was never there. 
Some claim that powerful magic moved or hid the 
island in a vast illusion. That I find believable, because 
the Lords of Nim bra! have long been known for illusion 
and trickery. If any isle were to vanish into thin air, it 
would be theirs. Likewise, Nimbral's return is certainly 
within their capabilities, and perhaps this event is the 
climax of a trick so long and complex that even a gnome 
can envy its scope. 
Nimbral today is much as it has always been: far-flung 
and f>ecretive. Where the island went, what it did while 
gone, and why it came back all seem to be facts the 
Lords of Nimbral prefer to keep to themselves. 
Nimbral is still ruled by its mysterious lords, a closely 
related family of archmages, master illusionists all. They 
in turn appoint the heralds, who proclaim the laws, and 
the Knights of Nim bra I, fabled hippogriff riders clad in 
armor clear .as glass but strong as steel. Don't let the 
fact that they are called knights fool you. The Knights of 
Nimbral have always acted as pirates when out on patrol 
over the seas, preying on ships that strayed close to 
their island. 
What my captain friends were doing in waters so 
close to Nimbral they did not disclose. "Business" was 
all they'd say, but no one has business so far south as 
Nimbral, unless they expect to dock at the island. Alas, 
in the time since we last spoke, all those captains have 
died, and I can't question them further about what they 
know of the place. 
If you have cause to sail south by Chu It, keep a wary 
eye on the skies. It might not help, since the Knight of 
Nimbral have been known to appear out of nowhere, 
apparently invisible before they attacked, but it pays to 
be cautious when you're doing something foolish. 
EVERMEET 
What I tell you now is truth as pure as Garl's nugget, 
and the only reason I've written it in a book for all to 
see is that no one else shall ever achieve the feat: I 
stowed away on a ship bound for Evermeet, and my feet 
touched its blessed ground! 
Any who're knowledgeable about the place might 
scoff at my claim, and those ignorant of it like as not 
think the deed not the feat of legend it was, so let me 
explain to those doubters among you what Evermeet is 
and why, by the end of my tale, you'll envy my boots. 
A LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN 
Legend has it- and so believes every elf I've ever met-
that the island of Evermeet is not of this world, and 
that it never was. In ancient days, so long ago that even 
elves think of it as their mythic past, the elves of many 
nations sought a perfect homeland for their people. 
(That was the problem there, of course. You'll miss out 
on a wealth of beauty it you're always looking for the 
perfect gem.) Not finding it in the world, some elves 
(sun elves, I'd wager) looked beyond the world to create 
one. These High Mages gathered together to perform 
a mighty work of magic that would bring Tori! into 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
contact with Arvandor- that's right, the mad fools actu-
ally wanted to bring into our world some of the lands in 
which their gods dwelt! 
Tales differ on whether Corellon allowed this or was 
powerless to prevent it, but it happened, and calamity 
gripped Tori! as a result. This was the first Sundering, 
and elves have always said it echoed through time. 
Recent calamities would seem to prove them right. 
When things settled down, the elves realized their 
folly. For thousands of years, no elf dared set foot on 
Evermeet. But eventually Corellon must have forgiven 
his wayward children, for the oldest elves began to feel 
the call to the west. 
Perhaps you've seen a moonbow hang over Selfine 
and heard the idea that it means an elf is being called 
to Evermeet. Well, that is no children's story. Ever 
met an elderly elf? How would you know, right? Well 
if you're ever honored to meet an elderly elf at such a 
time, you'll see a similar arc in each of the elf's eyes 
above the pupil. This is Sehanine Moonbow's way of 
guiding the elf to the afterlife. The arcs can blind the 
elf to this world, but they vanish when the elf enters 
the next, allowing sight of the elven heaven. Well that's 
exactly what happens in Evermeet, and the elf need 
not be dead to achieve it. Don't believe me? Well, I saw 
what I saw. 
Some elves followed their aged kin to Evermeet, and 
soon a kingdom of elves dwelt in a heaven on Tori!. For 
ages Evermeet was protected by mighty beasts, mighty 
magic, and the might of the Seldarine themselves. 
Elves of all types from all over the world journeyed to 
Evermeet seeking solace. And when the elves declared 
their Retreat from the world, where do you think 
they went? 
Then the Spellplague struck, and some of that old 
elven High Magic must have unraveled. Evermeet 
became unmoored from the world and found itself 
instead in a sea of the Feywild, that strange realm of 
faerie that touches the world in mystical places. For a 
century, it seemed Evermeet was lost to the world. Ven-
erable elves tried to hold on, hoping that this echo of 
the first Sundering might echo Evermeet's connection 
to the world once the period of calamity ended. 
Their patience (who but an elf could have such 
patience?) was at last rewarded, when ships from Ever-
meet docked once more in Sword Coast ports. 
SAILING TO THE WEST 
Knowing all this and having just met a venerable elf 
who was preparing for the journey, how could I not 
take the opportunity to tag along? I felt a little bad 
about taking advantage of the elf's blindness and forc-
ing him to leave behind some of his baggage, but it was 
the opportunity of a lifetime! 
I overheard it said by the captain of the ship that 
Evermeet now somehow straddles all three planes: 
our world, the Feywild, and Arvandor. It touches them 
all, but exists fully in none of them. To find it, you must 
follow a pattern of stars until the stars change and then 
follow new stars. (I swear by Garl's nugget that's what 
he said!) Those who stray from the path are lost. How
