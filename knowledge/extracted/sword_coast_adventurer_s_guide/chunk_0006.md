seek their fortunes. Some of the exotic plants that grow 
only in Chult fetch high prices in mainland markets. Ru-
ined Mezro stands across the sea from Calimshan, wait-
ing for explorers and its displaced people to cleanse the 
city of its undead inhabitants and uncover the treasures 
that lie hidden there. 
Eastward along the Chultan peninsula lie the remains 
of Thindol and Samarach. Despite the apparent fall of 
both civilizations, Thindol remains infested with yu-
an-ti, while the illusions cloaking Samarach's mountain 
passes conceal the activities in that nation. 
Dambrath. Situated on a warm plain on the shore of 
the Great Sea, Dambrath is ruled by nomadic clans of 
human horse riders who revere Silvanus, Malar, and 
occasionally Seh1ne. Given the Dambrathans' history 
of domination by the Crinti, a ruling caste of half-drow, 
it is no surprise that they reserve their greatest hatred 
for the drow. 
The clans meet twice a year at a sacred site known as 
the Hills of the Kings, where dozens of totem sculptures 
are preserved. At these gatherings, each clan updates its 
totem with an account of its exploits over the previous 
seasons. Many Dambrathans seek out lycanthropy as a 
means of showing reverence for their favored deity and 
honoring their heritage. 
CHAPTER 1 I WELCOME TO THE REALMS 
El/harrow. A blasted near-desert north and east of the 
North Wall mountains bordering Halruaa, Elfharrow 
isn't a name bestowed by its residents, but rather the 
sobriquet that travelers use for this violent region. The 
tribes of xenophobic elves that claim this area don't hes-
itate to discourage uninvited guests by any means nec-
essary. A simple group of pilgrims might be scared off 
with some arrows, while a band of hunters or explorers 
is likely to be killed outright. 
Food is sparse in this region, with the forests long since 
vanished, and as a result the elves of Elfharrow fiercely 
protect the herds of animals they have cultivated. The 
elves have no interest in looting the cities of fallen Lapa-
liiya, but neither are they willing to allow "adventurers" 
free access to those lands through their territory. 
Halruaa. Once believed destroyed in the conflagration 
of the Spellplague, Halruaa has largely been restored to 
the insular, magic-mighty nation it once was. Because 
of the foresight of their divinations, Halruaan wizards 
were able to use the raging blue fire that followed Mys-
tra's death to propel their nation safely into the realm of 
Toril's twin, Abeir (displacing part of that world into the 
Plane of Shadow). 
Now that the events of those times have mostly been 
undone, the famed Halruaan skyships and waterborne

vessels have spread out from their home once again, 
seeking to establish trading routes and political connec-
tions, as well as to learn what has changed of the world 
in their century of absence. 
The Lake of Steam. Far to the south and east of the 
Sword Coast, the Lake of Steam is more accurately 
an inland sea, its waters tainted by volcanism and un-
drinkable. Around its perimeter is a conglomeration of 
city-states and minor baronies typified by the shifting 
domains known as the Border Kingdoms. Here, along 
the southern shore of the lake, explorers and fortune 
seekers squander their amassed wealth building cas-
tles, founding communities, and drawing loyal vassals 
to them- only to have all those good works disappear 
within a generation or two. In some cases, one of these 
realms is fortunate to be saved from its inevitable de-
cline by another group of successful adventurers, who 
inject enough wealth and wisdom to keep the enterprise 
going a few more decades. 
Luiren. Long the homeland of halflings and thought 
to be the place where their race had its genesis, Luiren 
was lost during the Spellplague to a great inundation 
of the sea. In the century since that great disaster, the 
waters receded, and now stories told by travelers from 
the south tell of halfling communities that survived as 
island redoubts. 
Tethyr. Tethyr is a feudal realm ruled by Queen Anais 
from its capital of Darromar. The queen commands 
her dukes, who in turn receive homage from the counts 
and countesses of the realm, appoint sheriffs over their 
counties, and generally maintain order. The farmlands 
of Tethyr are abundant, and its markets flow freely with 
trade from the Western Heartlands. 
Tethyr has seen more than its share of noble intrigue 
and royal murder, and adventurers who are native to 
Tethyr or merely passing through that land are often 
drawn into such plots, either as unwitting accomplices 
or as easy scapegoats. 
LANDS TO THE EAST 
To the east lie many of the older nations of the Realms, 
including the Western Heartlands of Faen1n- those civ-
ilizations centrally located on the continent, and thereby 
best able to take advantage of trade routes and access to 
the Sea of Fallen Stars. As in the North, there are cold 
lands to the east, as well as more temperate regions. As 
one travels farther from the Sword Coast, one moves 
from lands not so different from one's own to places so 
foreign they might as well exist on other continents or 
worlds- which a few of them actually have done. 
Aglarond. The great peninsula of Aglarond juts out 
into the Inner Sea, and that body of water and the for-
ests of the Yuirwood define much of the nation's charac-
ter. A realm of humans living in harmony with their elf 
and half-elf neighbors, Aglarond has been a foe of Thay 
for centuries, in part due to the temperament of its for-
mer ruler, the Simbul. The nation is now ruled by a Sim-
barch Council, which has backed away from open hos-
tilities with Thay. With the restoration of the Weave, the 
ongoing changes to the political landscape, and calls for 
elven independence within the nation, it is unclear what 
REGIONS OF THE REALMS 
Just as "the North" describes an area that includes a num-
ber of nations and governments, a number of collective 
terms exist for other regions across FaerOn. Not all such 
names are used universally, and opinions vary as to which 
lands qualify in which groups. Here are some currently 
recognized regional groupings: 
The Cold Lands: Damara, Narfell, Sossal, and Vaasa 
The Heartlands: Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Moonsea, 
and Sembia 
The Lands of Intrigue: Arnn, Calimshan, and Tethyr, also 
known as the Empires of the Sands 
The Old Empires: Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther 
sort of place Aglarond will be in a generation's time, ex-
cept that its potential for great change will be realized. 
Chessenta. A collection of city-states bound by com-
mon culture and mutual defense, Chessenta isn't truly 
a nation. Each city boasts its own heroes, worships its 
own gladiatorial champions, and spends as much time 
insulting and competing with the other cities as it does 
on any other activity. The city of Luthcheq is dominated 
by worship of the bizarre deity known as Entropy, while 
Erebos is ruled by the latest incarnation of the red 
dragon known as Tchazzar the Undying. Heptios con-
tains the largest library in Chessenta, a center of learn-
ing where all nobles aspire to send their children for tu-
toring. That city is looked on with disdain by the people 
of Akanax, whose militant contempt for the "fat philos-
ophers" of Heptios is widely known. Toreus welcomes 
all visitors, even those from lands that are despised or 
mistrusted, and foreign coin can buy nearly anything 
there. The floating city of Airspur still flies somehow, its 
earthmotes unaffected by the fall of its fellows when the 
Sundering came to a close. 
Cormyr. For most folk in central Faen1n, the notion 
of a human kingdom is inextricably linked to Cormyr. 
A strong realm bolstered by its loyal army (the Purple 
Dragons), a cadre of magical defenders and investiga-
tors (the War Wizards), and numerous wealthy and in-
fluential nobles, Cormyr is recovering from its war with 
Sembia and Netheril- a conflict that cost the nation 
much, but left the kingdom standing, and which, in the 
end, Netheril didn't survive. The pride of that victory re-
mains strong in Cormyr's collective consciousness, even 
as Queen Raedra draws back from plans to permanently 
welcome into the realm towns that lie beyond Cormyr's 
traditional borders. 
Cormyreans are justly proud of their homeland, and go 
to great lengths to guard it and its honor. Still, there is no 
shortage of danger in the Forest Kingdom, whether from 
scheming, treacherous nobles, monsters out of the Hul-
l a ck Forest or the Stonelands, or some ancient, hidden 
magic. Corm yr is many things, but dull isn't one of them. 
The Cold Lands. The nations of Damara, Narfell, Sos-
sal, and Vaasa, known collectively to most Faerunians as 
the Cold Lands, rest near the Great Glacier in the cold, 
dry environs of the northeast. Few outside the region 
have much interest in what goes on here, except for those 
in the immediately surrounding lands, who fear a resur-
gence of the ancient evils of the region- though they ar-
