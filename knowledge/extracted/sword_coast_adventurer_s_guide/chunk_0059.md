and have fought occasional wars with the Ffolk in the 
centuries that the two groups have uneasily shared 
the islands. 
ALA RON 
The largest and most populous isle of the Moonshaes is 
Alaron. The Ffolk stronghold of Caer Callidyr overlooks 
a bay south of the Fairheight Mountains, at the northern 
edge of Dornall Forest. The forest is a perilous place, 
filled with goblins, worgs, and their ilk. The deeper one 
goes, the more otherworldly the woods become, with 
fey creatures leading travelers astray- or to their doom. 
Even the High King's rangers walk the forest with care. 
Rumor has it the Rookoath dwarves of the Fairhe-
ight range- bolstered by Clan Rustfire of the isle of 
Gwynneth, and adventurers out of Callidyr-have won 
victories against the local ores and their shadow dragon 
master. High King Derid hopes to forge an alliance with 
the dwarves, but thus far they have spurned the aid of 
the crown. 
Meanwhile, Kythyss, a port town on the Great South 
Head of Alaron, has been hiring mercenaries to guard 
caravans running north to Callidyr. Caravan masters 
there are always looking for help, if you're willing to 
brave the road for a while. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
GWYNN ETH 
Over my lifetime, the isle of Gwynneth has become ever 
more fey and mysterious, home to the elven realm of 
Sarifal, under the rule of High Lady Ordalf. 
Sarifal shares the island with the reclusive mountain 
kingdom of Synnoria, the home of the Llewyr elves, plus 
a few small shield dwarf settlements, and the ruins of 
Caer Corwell, the former Ffolk settlement on Gwyn-
neth. High King Derid wants to reclaim the old citadel 
and rebuild it as an embassy, but has yet to secure Lady 
Ordal f's consent to do so. 
Gwynneth is also home to Myrloch Vale, a lush valley 
nestled in the mountains with the shimmering waters 
of the Myrloch to the south. Druid circles are active in 
the Vale, allied with the elves and the fey creatures of 
this area. 
In the north of the island, High Lady Ordalf's son, 
Prince Araithe, leads the struggle against the darker fey 
of the forest of Winterglen. The prince is a pragmatist 
willing to accept aid in fending off his people's foes, and 
so has been known to allow adventuring companies to 
cross the Strait of Alaron and land on Gwynneth, if they 
pledge to aid the cause. 
KORINN ARCHIPELAGO 
The Korinn Archipelago is dozens of rocky, rainy, 
and windswept islands populated mostly by North-
landers, who herd sheep, fish the nearby waters, and 
occasionally go raiding or pirating. Dozens of separate 
settlements are their own mini-kingdoms with little that 
unifies them besides a shared Northlander culture. 
There's no safe harbor for outsiders; you just have no 
idea what you are dealing with. For other Northlanders, 
the settlement of Westhaven on Pandira serves as a neu-
tral ground where Northlanders of all stripes who ply 
the waters of the Sea of Swords might come to port and 
wait out a storm or resupply. 
MORAY 
To the west of Gwynneth, Moray is a land at war with 
itself. The embattled Ffolk of Caer Moray struggle to 
keep the port town open so that Dynnegall, farther 
inland, can receive vital goods and supplies. 
These supplies sometimes include reinforcements 
to deal with the threats of the island, which are many 
and varied: the Black Blood tribe of Malar-worshiping 
werefolk, the giants of the Trollclaw Range in the north, 
and the ogres and ores of the Orcskill Mountains in 
the south. 
The Ffolk of Moray are loyal to the High King. They 
hope for a return to a unified Moonshaes under the 
VALKUR, HERO-Goo OF THE NORTH LANDERS 
Whi le Northlanders revere many other gods-Auril, Um-
berlee, Talos, and Tempus, in particular-they see mighty 
Valkur as the most important. This hero-god is unique 
to the Northlanders and embodies the qualities that 
Northlanders most admire: fierceness, cunning, courage, 
strength, and sailing skill.
