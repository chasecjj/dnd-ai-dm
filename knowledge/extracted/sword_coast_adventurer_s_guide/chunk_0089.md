The duergar make their homes mainly beyond a great 
wall, which I never passed through. To the north, the 
floor of the cavern that contains the Darklake hovers 
dangerously low, such that in some places it is barely 
ten feet above the water's surface. The whole of the 
great cavern glows, and the continuous flow of hot iron 
through the city gives the illumination a yellow cast at 
all times. It is frightening, if you forget where you are. 
More than that, it is hot. 
After a month or so of working under a minor smith, 
I quarreled with the apprentice set to supervise me, 
and he dared me to test the strength of his new blade. 
It broke, as I expected, but did the job well enough. The 
duergar didn't seem to be angry that the apprentice lay 
dead at my feet, but it was only a short time thereafter 
that I was dragged off to the market to be sold. As it 
happened, a human was in the city on some diplomatic 
mission. I caught his eye, and he purchased me. 
MANTOL-DERITH 
I soon learned that I was not bought entirely for my 
brute strength, but also for what knowledge I had of 
the duergar. My new owner was a member of some 
group he called the Zhentarim, and when I told him all 
I knew, he offered me my freedom and a place among 
his agents. Together we would journey to a place called 
Mantol-Derith, where I would serve as his bodyguard. 
From there we would go to the surface, and I could 
remain in his employ if I wished. Freedom and a job? 
How could I refuse? 
Mantol-Derith is a hidden place accessed by secret 
ways. Slaves, such as I had been, are typically not per-
mitted to go there. Once in the cavern, I had to remain 
near my employer, but by keeping my eyes and ears 
open, I learned a lot about this place. 
Mantol-Derith is where duergar, drow, and svirfneblin 
come to trade with each other and with surface-dwellers 
interested in conducting business with the deep places. 
Its location is kept secret- I only know that it is fairly 
close to the Darklake. The drow sell weapons, armor, 
magic scrolls and potions, and fine works of art. The 
duergar trade mainly in fine steel, and demand high 
prices to do so. Deep gnomes come to market with 
gems, certain fungi only they are capable of growing, 
and salt, which much of the Underdark has little ready 
supply of. The surface folk bring wines, ales, and spirits, 
cloth, wood, paper, and a great many other goods. 
The laws of Mantol-Derith don't seem to care about 
anything other than commerce. There must be no prohi-
bition on what sorts of creatures can visit here- among 
other things, I saw a pair of mind flayer envoys doing 
business in the market. The most serious of crimes are 
theft, the use of magic to influence negotiations, and the 
counterfeiting of goods by mundane or magical means. 
Anyone discovered to be in violation is sentenced on 
the spot, wrapped in heavy chains, and carted off to be 
tossed to the bottom of the Darklake. 
When my employer's business was concluded, he was 
true to his word, and we left for the surface. If only the 
drow with whom he did business were so trustworthy. 
We were ambushed, he was killed, and I was again put 
in chains.
