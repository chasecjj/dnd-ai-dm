King Emerus by naming him the second king of 
restored. Gauntlgrym (after King Connerad was granted 
the honor of first kingship posthumously), but for 
most Felbarran dwarves, this honor is an empty com-
fort, because their beloved hero-king has been taken 
from them. 
Now ruling Citadel Felbarr are King Emerus's dis-
tant kin, King Morinn and Queen Tithmel, who were 
recently married in a union designed to join separate 
claims to the throne into one family. Tithmel's claim to 
the throne is the stronger by a small degree of kinship, 
but Morinn is a quieter, more thoughtful ruler. Queen 
Tithmel has ever been a warrior, and some Felbarran 
are afraid she may run headlong into the wrong battle 
before the couple can provide the realm with an heir, 
and so they hope that King Morinn's softer influence 
will help to temper her impetuous nature and keep the 
city strong through the trying times following the recent 
conflicts. Although the two monarchs share the rule of 
the city, and speak with absolute authority, their citizens 
are wise to listen to what both have to say before decid-
ing how to act on royal edicts. 
Most humans know Citadel Felbarr from a distance. 
They see only a great raised road winding through a 
vale of broken rock, brooded over by two barbicans 
known as the Hammer and the Anvil. Two other fortifi-
cations loom higher still over the road, embedded in the 
nearby cliffs and built atop them. These are the North 
Vigil and the South Vigil. Far beyond them, the massive 
Rune Gate stands at the end of the road to give entrance 
into Felbarr, but visitors rarely pass through it. 
Like most dwarven cities, Felbarr exists almost 
entirely underground. However, since it has been 
invaded by ores more than once, no accurate maps of 
the city's full interior are known to exist, preventing 
would-be attackers from gaining their information. 
Dwarves, even those visiting from other realms through 
the connections with the Lowroad, have little trouble 
finding their way around, but humans, especially those 
who can't read Dwarvish or the shorthand runes carved 
throughout the city, have a far more difficult time. 
Following the war, most Felbarran applauded the 
dissolution of the Silver Marches. In its time of great-
est need, no races other than dwarves moved even the 
slightest to aid Citadel Felbarr, when more assistance 
and better coordination might have prevented not only 
that citadel's fall, but Sundabar's as well. Felbarran 
merchants remain willing to trade with the cities of the 
North, and will aid the other dwarven kingdoms when 
necessary, but it is doubtful that Queen Tithmel will 
ever consider an alliance with humans like the one that 
created Luruar, even if King Morinn might. 
GAUNTLGRYM 
Gauntlgrym has a complex and contradictory history, 
the gist of it depending on who's doing the telling. 
Humans have one story, of what they know from recent 
years, but for us dwarves, Gauntlgrym is an ancient 
place, first delved as a mine in the earliest days of Old 
Delzoun. All sorts of myths persist about the great 
mithral doors of the city, but at its start, Gauntlgrym 
was simply a mine. When they delved too deeply, the 
dwarves there discovered the presence of a great being 
of flame, sealed the mines, and left. Only later, when 
the humans begged the Delzoun dwarves to build one, 
was there ever a city in Gauntlgrym. It arose because, 
this time, the dwarves succeeded in harnessing the 
primal power of fire in the depths, thus creating 
the Great Forge that made the city possible. Or so 
the stories go. 
Despite all the quests undertaken by adventurers 
down the centuries, none ever truly found the ancient 
city until the ghosts of Gauntlgrym's former denizens 
began calling to living dwarves to seek out the city. And 
some did-or tried to, anyway. Shortly thereafter, the 
ore wars began anew, and nearly every dwarf's attention 
turned back to the existing dwarfuolds and the dangers 
those places now faced. Gradually, as the ores were 
pushed back and the dwarven cities secured anew, 
those delvers began to recall their promises to their 
ancestors. Further, when the war ended, King Bruenor 
Battlehammer of Mithra! Hall promised to lead the 
dwarves to Gauntlgrym and reclaim it for the dwarves of 
the North. 
It took fierce fighting to drive out the creatures that 
had claimed the city from below, and no one is quite 
sure who or what- aside from the draw-had tried 
to occupy Gauntlgrym, but in the end, the dwarven 
armies prevailed, and Bruenor claimed the victory. 
King Emerus Warcrown of Citadel Felbarr was gravely 
wounded, and Bruenor proclaimed him the second king 
of Gauntlgrym before his death. When dear Emerus 
passed on, Bruenor assumed the rule of Gauntlgrym, 
once again abdicating the leadership in Mithra! Hall. 
There are some who think that King Bruenor has 
designs on a great, restored empire of Delzoun, with the 
dwarves of all the North- from Ironmaster to Adbar and 
Sundabar- swearing him fealty. Others fear that he will 
punish those settlements that didn't contribute warriors 
to the cause to retake Gauntlgrym, but those folk don't 
know the returned king very well. If he wants a reborn 
Delzoun, may Moradin and his children grant him the 
wisdom to do it right, and the fortitude to see it through. 
It's a throne I wouldn't wish on anyone. 
THE CANTICLE OF GAUNTLGRYM 
Passed down by dwarves throughout the North for cen-
turies, the Canticle of Gauntlgrym is now something of 
an anthem for the reclaimed city. It is often sung on the 
road by dwarven travelers on their way to make a life in 
Bruenor's halls. 
Silver halls and mithral doors 
Stone walls to seal the cavern 
Grander sights than e'er before 
In smithy, mine, and tavern 
Toil hard in endless night 
In toast, oh, lift yer flagon! 
Ye'll need the drink to keep ye right 
At forge that bakes the dragon. 
Come Delzoun, come one and all! 
Rush to grab yer kin 
And tell 'em that their home awaits 
In grandest Gauntlgrym!
