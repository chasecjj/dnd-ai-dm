The five High Captains take the names of their Ships 
when they ascend to leadership. The captains are the 
highest authorities in Luskan; they and the members 
of their Ships conduct themselves as a sort of nobility, 
albeit one that isn't hereditary. 
Despite the name, each Ship is not a single vessel, 
but an organization of stalwarts owing allegiance to one 
another and to their captain, whom they elect for life. To 
be a member of a Ship is a select privilege, one that only 
one in ten of Luskan's residents can claim. 
The five Ships of Luskan are more than gangs of 
pirates. They are fellowships of people who live, train, 
work, make love, and go to war with each other. To join 
one is a mark of honor and continues a grand tradition 
that Luskar associate with democracy, self-determina-
tion, and individuality. 
Each Ship has its own symbol and colors. Members 
of a Ship often wear their colors, decorate their round 
shields with the symbol and colors, and tattoo them-
selves with the symbol. Like their Northlander relations, 
Luskar Ship members regularly tattoo their faces, but 
instead of representing their island, the tattoos are 
either personal marks or tattoos of their allegiance to 
their Ship. 
Membership in a Ship is voluntary, but once under-
taken it is until death. To join a Ship, a Luskar must be 
of fighting age (fourteen or so, for humans), and possess 
at least one sword or axe, one spear, and three of the 
sturdy, bossed shields the Northlanders prefer. Each 
Ship accepts new candidates from time to time to fill 
vacancies caused by death, but as a rule, the Ships don't 
expand their ranks by taking on a large number of new 
members at one time. 
Each Ship has some number of sailing vessels, the 
size, crew, and type of which help to determine the influ-
ence of the Ship's High Captain and its rank within the 
city. The current First Ship, Kurth, has so many vessels 
that it nearly outnumbers the next two Ships combined, 
and its membership is so numerous that Ships Suljack, 
Taerl, and Rethnor could merge and still not equal it. 
The laws of the city govern the behavior of the Ships 
and their captains, decreeing the Ships responsible for 
the city's defense, its administration, and the manage-
ment of its resources. Beyond these universal tasks, 
each captain takes on other duties as desired in order 
of that Ship's standing in the hierarchy, leaving less 
glamorous and less lucrative tasks to the captains and 
Ships of lower rank. 
Since each of the Ships has the ability to take what it 
likes and leave what it doesn't want to the lesser Ships, 
a strict division of duties has arisen among them. 
Ship Kurth controls the city's docks and activity 
occurring thereupon. Among the most profitable of the 
merchandise that passes through the port are weapons 
and tools from Ironmaster, and ambergris for the per-
fume trade. 
Ship Baram operates Luskan's fishing industry. The 
food it provides is so vital to the city's welfare nowadays 
that Baram has risen to Second Ship on the strength of 
its successful forays out to sea. 
Ship Suljack holds sway over, and conducts most of, 
the piracy and raiding that originates out of Luskan. 
It occasionally passes the more meager opportunities 
down to Taerl. 
Ship Taerl, recently elevated from Fifth Ship, had 
been accustomed to taking the hindmost. Now its work-
ers and sailors happily accept chances for profit handed 
down from above, and just as happily delegate the most 
menial and undesirable chores to Rethnor. 
Ship Rethnor engages in few worthwhile activities 
aside from guard duty, which is a poor source of income. 
Rethnor toughs sometimes roam the streets of Luskan, 
looking for a quick and perhaps violent way to grab 
some coin. 
PEOPLE AND LAWS 
Without question, the people of Luskan show their 
Northlander heritage. They raid ships and coastal set-
tlements, engage in interdiction and piracy, and value 
strength of arms above most other qualities. During 
Luskan's long history on the Sword Coast, however, the 
city has adopted many of the attitudes of mainland folk. 
Luskar don't kidnap people from other settlements or 
tribes, and they hold that women have social standing 
equal to men (two of the High Captains, Suljack and 
Taerl, are women). They don't distrust magic, as their 
island brethren do. Slavery is, at least nominally, illegal 
in Luskan, though a slave taken and sold at sea is usu-
ally overlooked by authorities. 
The law in Luskan is supposed to be upheld by 
soldiers of the Ships, who are empowered to arrest 
criminals and bring them before the Magistrates of the 
city. In practice, arrests are as often made by mobs, but 
the result is the same: an appearance before the Magis-
trates. Each of the five Magistrates is chosen by a High 
Captain, but need not be a member of that captain's 
Ship. The Magistrates are, at least officially, neutral. 
Most citizens have their cases decided by a single one of 
these judges, but a dispute involving a Ship member is 
heard by all five. 
TRADE AND COMMERCE 
Luskan doesn't officially tax its citizens; the city makes 
its money through trade, fishing, piracy, and raiding. 
The defense of the city comes at the expense of the 
Ships, paid for by the profits of those activities as well as 
the protection money the Ships extort from businesses 
and homes to keep the thieves and gangs at bay. Bribery
