0ETHEK, THE LETTERS ANO NUMERALS OF DwARVISH 
GoDs OF CRAFT 
Dumathoin, the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain, 
is the patron of the shield dwarves, as well as the god 
of buried wealth, mining, gems, and exploration, and 
the guardian of the dead. Sharindlar, Lady of Life and 
Mercy, is the goddess of healing, romantic love, and fer-
tility, often associated with the moon. 
GODS OF FAR PLACES 
The god of invention and discovery is Dugmaren Bright-
mantle, called the Wandering Tinker or the Gleam 
in the Eye. Marthammor Duin is the traveler's god, 
patron of expatriates and guides, and deity of lightning 
and roads. 
GoDs OF WEALTH 
Vergadain, called the Merchant King, is the god of 
thieves (who commands his followers never to steal 
from other dwarves), luck, and chance, as well as com-
merce and negotiation. Abbathor is the god of greed, 
sometimes portrayed as a dragon filled with envy of the 
wealth of others, who jealously tends his own hoard. 
GODS OF EVIL 
Laduguer is the patron of the duergar, god of magic and 
those crafts not governed by Moradin. Also worshiped 
among the duergar is Deep Duerra, a goddess of con-
quest and of the powers of the mind. 
ELVES 
Skilled in both magic and warfare, the Tel'Quessir- "the 
People," as they call themselves- came to FaerO.n ages 
ago, building vast and powerful empires long before the 
rise of humans. The days of the great elven nations are 
now long past, and many elves have withdrawn from the 
world into isolated sylvan realms, or set sail across the 
Trackless Sea to the isle of Evermeet. 
Unlike dwarves, who developed subraces in the 
world, elves brought their divisions with them, settling 
into separate kingdoms by type. Beings of immense 
power, the first elves explored and settled the world, 
bringing about a golden age of art, magic, and civi-
lization. At the height of their power, the elves per-
formed a High Magic ritual intended to create the ideal 
homeland. They succeeded, but the spell sundered 
the land in a terrible cataclysm at the same time that 
it caused the distant isle of Evermeet to rise from be-
neath the sea. 
Then came the Crown Wars, a series of conflicts be-
tween the great elven kingdoms lasting three thousand 
years. These battles devastated much of the world and 
resulted in the dark elves' flight into the Underdark. 
Reeling from these calamities, the elven empires went 
into a long, slow decline, and many of their kind took 
part in the great Retreat to their refuge on Evermeet. As 
the elves increasingly withdrew from the world, other 
races and civilizations rose to prominence in FaerO.n. 
The Elvish language used across FaerO.n- sometimes 
called the True Tongue by elves-is written in the grace-
ful script of the Espruar alphabet. Seldruin, the ancient 
language of elven High Magic that uses the Hamarfae 
alphabet, is all but forgotten nowadays. 
MOON ELVES 
Also called silver elves, or Teu'Tel'Quessir, moon elves 
are more tolerant and adventurous than elves of other 
sorts. In ancient times, the dissolution of their empires 
dispersed moon elves among other races, and since 
then they have traditionally gotten along well with their 
non-elf neighbors. They mingle with other people while 
their kin remain in hidden settlements and secluded 
strongholds.
