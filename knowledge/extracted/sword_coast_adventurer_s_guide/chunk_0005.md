There is much danger and adventure to be had in the 
free places of the North, and a great deal of wealth and 
treasure. as well. The ruins of ancient kingdoms and 
countless smaller settlements litter the countryside, 
waiting for the right explorers to happen upon them. 
THE UNDERDARK 
Extending miles downward and outward beneath the 
surface of FaerO.n, and reaching to other continents as 
well, the great network of subterranean caverns known 
as the Underdark is home to all manner of strange and 
deadly creatures. Duergar and drow- dark reflections 
of dwarves and elves-live in these sunless lands, as do 
the svirfneblin, or deep gnomes. Most surface-dwelling 
folk aren't threatened or even disturbed by denizens 
of the deep places, but the creatures occasionally 
emerge to raid or to seek some kind of goal in the sur-
face world. 
Among the lands of the Underdark beneath the North 
are the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone, the duergar 
city of Gracklstugh, and the infamous drow city of Men-
zoberranzan. Also prominent is Mantol-Derith, a trading 
post for Underdark merchants. 
TORIL AND ITS LANDS 
Tori! is a vast and wondrous world, filled with an im-
mense diversity of peoples and a rich, full history. For 
most folk of the Sword Coast, however, knowledge 
doesn't extend much beyond the confines of the North, 
and anything "known" outside of FaerO.n proper is based 
more in rumor than in fact. 
FAERUN 
The vast central continent of Tori!, FaerO.n is a land 
mass divided by a great sea known as the Inner Sea, or 
the Sea of Fallen Stars. The lands beyond the North can 
be roughly divided into those to the south and those to 
the east, becoming more foreign to the folk of the Sword 
Coast and the North the farther away they are. 
LANDS TO THE SOUTH 
To the south of the Sword Coast lie ancient nations, a 
tremendous, forbidding jungle, and all manner of lands 
destroyed or transformed by magical cataclysms and up-
heavals. Amid the ruin and the distress in these realms 
are signs of renewal and hope, as tenacious civilizations 
and peoples rebuild, reclaim, and create anew. 
Amn. A nation led by the representatives of five noble 
families, Arnn is a place where the wealthy rule, openly 
and without pretense. Shrewd traders and ruthless in 
business, Amnians believe that the end of a successful 
transaction is justified by any means, ethical or oth-
erwise. Although the nation is richer by far than even 
the northern metropolises of Baldur's Gate and Water-
deep, its influence is curtailed by the unwillingness of 
its rulers to work together in the nation's best interest. 
The members of the Council of Five are fairly unified 
and tight-fisted in their control of Arnn, but their ability 
to affect events outside their own borders is limited be-
cause they can't agree enough on major matters of for-
eign policy. The oligarchs utterly control their nation, 
but beyond the areas that each rules, their families and 
businesses compete with one another and with the lo-
cals of far-flung places. 
The use of arcane magic is illegal in Arnn, meaning 
that the only authorized spellcasters in the nation are 
wielders of divine magic who enjoy the support and 
patronage of a temple, and users of arcane magic who 
have been given special dispensation by one of the oli-
garchs. So pervasive is the sway of Amn's oligarchy that 
few crimes merit physical punishment but those that 
involve the use of arcane magic or an offense against 
one of the council's merchant houses. Other infractions 
are forgiven after the miscreant makes payment of an 
appropriate fine. 
Calimshan. This southern land has long been the 
battleground for warring genies. After years of strug-
gling beneath their genasi masters, human slaves arose 
to follow a Chosen of Ilmater, at first using nonviolent 
resistance, and then erupting in full rebellion following 
his disappearance. They overthrew the genie lords of 
Calimport and Memnon, casting the remaining genies 
out of the cities and back to their elemental homes or 
into the depths of the deserts. 
Much of Calimshan is a chaotic place dominated by 
wealth, political influence, and personal power. Many 
pray for the return of the Chosen and the completion of 
his work. Others are learning to live together without 
genie masters, and to grudgingly accept the remaining 
genasi among them. 
Chult. The vast, choking jungles of Chult hide what 
many believe to be great mineral wealth, including large 
gemstones and veins of ore. Poisonous flora and fauna 
riddle the jungles, but some still brave the dangers to
