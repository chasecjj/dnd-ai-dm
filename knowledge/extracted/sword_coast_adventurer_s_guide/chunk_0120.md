TENETS OF THE CROWN 
The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the 
sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally em-
phasize the following tenets. 
Law. The law is paramount. It is the mortar that 
holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be 
respected. 
Loyalty. Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, 
oaths and laws are meaningless. 
Courage. You must be willing to do what needs to 
be done for the sake of order, even in the face of over-
whelming odds. If you don't act, then who will? 
Responsibility. You must deal with the consequences 
of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling 
your duties and obligations. 
OATH SPELLS 
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

CHANNEL DIVINITY 
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the follow-
ing Channel Divinity options. 
Champion Challenge. You issue a challenge that com-
pels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature 
of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you 
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet away 
from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are in-
capacitated or die or if the creature is moved more than 
30 feet away from you. 
Turn the Tide. As a bonus action, you can bolster 
injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each 
creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet 
of you regains hit points equal to ld6 +your Charisma 
modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its 
hit points. 
DIVINE ALLEGIANCE 
Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of 
you takes damage, you can use your reaction to mag-
ically substitute your own health for that of the target 
creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. 
Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can't 
be reduced or prevented in any way. 
UNYIELDING SPIRIT 
Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on saving 
throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned. 
EXALTED CHAMPION 
At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an in-
spiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use 
your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour: 
You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. 
• Your allies have advantage on death saving throws 
while within 30 feet of you. 
You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do 
your allies within 30 feet of you. 
This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 
RANGERS 
MO TOLIO HELD OUT HIS ARM, AND THE GREAT OWL 
promptly hopped onto it, carefully finding its footing on the 
man's heavy leather sleeve. 
"You have seen the draw?" Montolio asked. 
The owl responded with a whoo, then went off into a 
complicated series of chattering hoots and whoas. Montolio 
took it all in, weighing every detail. With the help of his 
friends, particularly this rather talkative owl, the ranger 
had monitored the drow for several days, curious as to why 
a dark elf had wandered into the valley. At first, Montolio 
had assumed that the drow was somehow connected to 
Graul, the chief ore of the region, but as time went on, the 
ranger began to suspect differently. 
- R.A. Salvatore, Sojourn 
Long have rangers walked the wilds of the Sword Coast 
and the Savage Frontier. Like druids, their practices 
date back to the earliest days of humanity. And long 
before humans set foot in the North, elf rangers strode 
through its forests and climbed its mountains. The tra-
ditions and outlook of these people are now shared by 
members of many races. In particular, lightfoot halflings 
frequently hear the call of the wild and become rangers, 
often acting as guides and protectors of roving halfling 
bands, and shield dwarves forced to wander far from old 
clanholds sometimes follow the ranger's path. 
Not every prospector wandering far hills or trapper 
hunting through uninhabited lands becomes a ranger. 
True rangers go out into nature and find it holy, and like 
paladins, they are touched by something divine. Their 
gods and creeds might differ, but rangers share similar 
values about the sanctity of nature. While by no means 
always aligned with one another, rangers are bound into 
a loose community of sorts- one that often connects 
with circles of druids. 
In the North and throughout much of the Heartlands, 
rangers use special marks to indicate campsites, dan-
gerous areas, evil creatures, foul magic, goblinoid activ-
ity, hidden caches of supplies, safe passage, shelter, and 
graves or tombs. Many of these symbols were derived 
from elven lore or borrowed from groups like the Harp-
ers. While by no means a secret language, these trail 
marks are often obtuse to non-rangers, and even druids 
might not understand them. 
As a whole, rangers serve to help societies survive and 
thrive in the wilderness. Much of the Sword Coast and
