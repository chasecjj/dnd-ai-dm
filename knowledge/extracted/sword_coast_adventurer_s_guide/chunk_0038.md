NOTE TO THE OM: MAKING THE REALMS YOURS 
The information in this chapter is intentionally nonspecific 
with respect to threats, monsters, and statistics. While 
you can use these details to flavor your descriptions of the 
towns and cities your players might visit, you should in no 
way consider these pieces of narration definitive. They're 
meant to provide touchstones, not to constrain your play-
ers to a narrow conception of the world. 
You might decide to change some of the details, either 
to surprise your players or to account for events that have 
transpired since they obtained the information herein. 
You're encouraged to take what's presented here and make 
it, and the Forgotten Realms, your own. 
more rambunctious offspring to unleash some of their 
destructive tendencies without harming the family's rep-
utation in proper society. As a result of being a member 
of the Lords' Alliance, Amphail is the equal of such 
great cities as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate in matters 
that concern the other powers of the region, despite its 
clear inferiority in size and strength. 
Amphail's sovereignty means that, although patrols 
from the Waterdeep City Guard sometimes ride north to 
check on matters in Amphail, the only true authority in 
the town is the will of the noble families that control it. 
The primary business of Amphail is horse ranching, and 
the town is a fine place to find replacement mounts, and 
all manner of tack, bridle, feed, and other goods neces-
sary to keep up one's horse. Most farms have farriers, or 
at least hands that can swiftly shoe a horse, and spare 
shoes all but litter the town. 
Visitors to Amphail often get a polite admonishment 
to "mind the high born" or "ware silver saddles" from 
the locals, but those who ignore such warnings should 
expect no help if they get into trouble with the nobility. 
Amphailans are by their nature suspicious of and quiet 
around folk who openly display wealth or status, having 
learned early in their lives that nobles are folk who 
like to throw their weight around, to the detriment of 
anyone nearby without enough coin or a grand enough 
title to stand up to them. I find that these common folk 
are ideal sources of information about the very people 
they distrust. 
For their part, the young nobles that litter the town 
seem to make mischief mainly because they can. The 
feuds and rivalries that would generate only carefully 
worded insults in the city can escalate into brawls 
when these miscreants are far from the watchful eyes 
of their parents. Duels have long been prohibited by 
mutual agreement, due to the blood feuds they pro-
voked in the past, but hands often drift to sword hilts 
when heated words are exchanged. Nearly every other 
sort of noble indiscretion is foisted on the residents of 
Amphail. Those who suffer property damage or worse 
at the nobles' hands are forced to forgive the offense 
in exchange for the application of coin or a promise 
made in the transgressor's name (suggesting that the 
youngster's relatives will handle any obligations). Some 
businesses survive entirely by bringing the comforts of 
Waterdeep to Amphail, creating gathering places where 
young nobles can feel at home. 
The three greatest families with significant inter-
ests in Amphail are Houses Amcathra, Ilzimmer, and 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
Roaringhorn; and most coin and business eventually 
passes through the hands one of those houses or its 
intermediaries. When Amphail joined the Lords' Alli-
ance, these three houses were the loudest and most 
influential voices, and now control the rulership of 
the town, with the controlling family changing each 
Shieldmeet. The current Lord Warder is Dauner Ilzim-
mer, who speaks for the town to the Lords' Alliance. 
House Amcathra has yet to choose its successor for 
next Shieldmeet. Houses Jhansczil and Tarm have 
smaller breeding concerns in the area, and House 
Eagleshields has holdings near Amphail that it uses to 
continue its long tradition of caring for unhealthy ani-
mals from nearby farms, and offers fine tack and other 
gear for sale. 
Among the common folk, the Oglyntyr family has the 
largest and oldest cattle and horse farm in Amphail, 
and supplies some of the finest Amphail grays (loyal, 
intelligent steeds favored as personal mounts) to nobles 
and travelers in the region. A new family, not noble 
but possessing much wealth, has purchased the old 
Baldasker ranch. We suspect that the Hemzar family, 
who were unknown in either Amphail or Waterdeep 
before the purchase, like most of the mysterious matters 
in Amphail, may have the secret backing of one noble 
house or another. 
My contacts say the Oglyntyrs have petitioned the 
Ilzimmers to help crush this upstart business, a move 
that they are considering. I visited the Hemzar ranch, 
and I'd consider such a move inadvisable. A large family 
of Tashlutar descent, they seemed capable and confident 
of their position, despite my warning. I wasn't allowed 
the opportunity to explore the property fully, but I 
did note signs that the Hemzars are prepared to rear 
and train far more dangerous beasts than horses and 
cattle. I was then tempted to warn the Oglyntyrs, but 
that family can be as odious as the worst nobles. These 
things tend to sort themselves out. 
The noble families ofWaterdeep who send their chil-
dren to Amphail, or allow them to go there, hope that 
their sons and daughters will learn some lessons about 
life while away from Waterdeep. If they are going to 
cause damage or hurt feelings in the process, at least 
they will do so far away from the watchful eyes of the 
other nobility of the city. To the young nobles, there is 
no one in Amphail of any real consequence who might 
be permanently harmed by any improprieties. They also 
believe there is no one of note nearby to hear these hot-
headed youngsters issue their boasts and proclaim their 
schemes- I have tnore than once learned of a threat 
simply by listening to children of different houses brag 
to one another about matters that were meant only for 
the family. 
Aside from the excesses of its nobles, Amphail is a 
peaceful town, with the threat of full-scale retaliation 
from both Waterdeep and the Lords' Alliance casting 
a long, dark shadow over any plans to disturb matters 
there. The nobles of Waterdeep have heavy purses, 
and are willing to spend as much coin as necessary 
to protect their favored playground- and to punish 
anyone that might disrupt their control over it. The 
only thing the nobles don't seem to be able to spend
