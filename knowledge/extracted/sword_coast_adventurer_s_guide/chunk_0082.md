are in residence. Halfling families often focus on agri-
cultural endeavors (aside from the small fungi gardens 
many gnomish households maintain in their cellars), 
while the area's miners are almost exclusively gnomes. 
Both folk work as herders, with halflings favoring 
sheep, and gnomes goats, as well as artisans of all 
sorts. Each community has a sheriff who maintains 
peace and leads defense-a role most often fulfilled 
by a halfling, I've found, though gnomes will certainly 
rise up in defense of their homes and neighbors when 
called upon. 
Some of the rural settlements mark the former 
locations of mines that have been played out. It isn't 
uncommon for halflings to move in where a gnomish 
mine have been abandoned, fixing up the surface 
entrances into acceptable, comfortable homes, with 
built-in tunnels that worm through the settlement. 
These passages might be helpful for defense or escape, 
but they are most often used when it's raining out to 
reach a neighbor's door and borrow a cup of honey, so 
as not to get oneself wet or track mud everywhere. 
On occasion, a community that sports large dwell-
ing-tunnels, with ample space for larger folk (or 
"big'uns," as the local gnomes say), turns its settlement 
into an establishment that caters to such clientele. The 
inns I know of are the Merry Mine-Lass, the Pipe and 
Hearthstone, and the Giants' Respite, my favorite. 
Each of these settlements is impressively self-sus-
taining. When official leadership is needed, the eldest 
halflings and gnomes are called upon to act in that 
capacity, but amity is the heart of community life in 
these hills. It is a shameful act among the Trieltans to 
refuse to reach a peaceable accord with one's fellows 
over some dispute. The folk here enjoy their simple 
lives, although I've come across a half-dozen or so 
young adventurers who hail from here, seeking out the 
newness of the world as a contrast to the familiarity of 
their homeland. 
Few dangerous creatures lurk in the hills- they are so 
densely settled (on and beneath the surface) that there 
is little space for monsters to lair. Cruel or ravenous 
creatures do occasionally creep into Trielta, mainly 
from the Forest of Wyrms, but such incursions don't last 
long- after a few sheep (and possibly a shepherd or two) 
are eaten, the sheriffs waste no time in forming a posse 
to hunt down or chase off the predators before they can 
do more harm. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
Now, sad to say, this situation might be changing for 
the worse. According to recent letters I have received 
from friends in these hills, parties of Najaran raiders 
have become more common and numerous. My friends 
fear that the threat from the Serpent Kingdom to the 
north will force Trieltans to seriously consider putting 
up an active defense of their lands for the first time in 
generations. 
UTHGARDT LANDS 
When I was newly departed from my homeland and first 
found my way to the North, I encountered a band of Uth-
gardt nomads on the trail-a part of the Elk tribe, led by 
a warrior named Gyrt. It was a tense meeting. 
I think the only reason I was not killed on sight is that 
I was an elf traveling alone. I think they feared I was a 
wizard. Uthgardt hate all magic but that of their sha-
mans and any enchanted weapons and armor they find, 
but a wizard willing to walk the wilds alone could be a 
powerful one. Traveling as we were on a grassy plain, 
we could see one another for some distance. Since I 
didn't strike them down with lightning from afar, they 
were willing to approach peaceably. 
Still, they stopped when they were within bowshot 
and seemed to be arguing about whether to shoot me. 
I waited as patiently as I could until one who seemed 
to be their leader addressed me in heavily accented 
Common. I replied a greeting in Bothii, their own 
ancient language, which again set the group to argu-
ment. At last, the leader dismounted and approached 
me, giving her name as Gyrt. Glad was I then that I took 
the time to learn the language from a learned friend 
in Evereska! 
In anticipation of any demand, I offered Gyrt a fine 
dagger from Evereska, as well as a necklace I wore. For 
her band I offered a bag of baubles I'd brought for such 
an occasion. Pleased with my gifts and assured that I 
was no wizard, Gyrt and I sat down to talk. I asked to 
share her campfire for the night, and Gyrt made space 
for me. That was my first meeting with Gyrt, but it 
wouldn't be my last, nor my last encounter with Uth-
gardt. I'm grateful to my friend Gyrt for teaching me so 
much about her people, for it has allowed me and many 
fellow travelers to see Uthgardt and live to tell the tale. 
Over the years, as I earned Gyrt's respect and she 
mine, we became friends, and I came to know her three 
sons as well. Though Gyrt died some decades ago, I still 
visit her children, whom I played with when they were 
young. They now have children of their own, and all call 
me auntie. 
During my time with Gyrt and her kin, the people of 
the Elk explained much to me about the workings of 
their tribe- their view of the world and their place in 
it, their traditions and the laws they live by. I came to 
realize, as I came across other Uthgardt tribes in my 
travels, that much of what is true for the Elk tribe is true 
for other Uthgardt. Though they comport themselves in 
seemingly disparate groups honoring different totems, 
Uthgardt have much in common. What follows is what 
I have learned of the people who call themselves "chil-
dren of Uthgar."
