WATERDEEP 
Rising from the shores of its deep harbor to ring the 
great mountain standing tall out of the Sea of Swords 
is Waterdeep, the City of Splendors and the Crown 
of the North. To all of Faerftn, this great metropolis 
stands as the pinnacle of what a great city might be, in 
wealth, influence, and stability. Here, the citizens work, 
the nobles sneer, and the great masked lords plot and 
scheme, all while merchants dance between them to 
collect their coins and continue profiting as best they 
can. Waterdeep's shops and merchants offer goods 
of every sort from every corner of Tori!, and even the 
rarest of items can be procured, given sufficient coin 
and patience. Adventurers lacking one or the other can 
very easily find all manner of employment, from simple 
escorting of caravans, to guarding nobility, to investigat-
ing a ruin or rumor of monsters anywhere in the North. 
Though it has stood for hundreds of years, Waterdeep 
is only now returning to its status of a century and a 
half ago. The recent disruptions began when the gods 
walked the Realms and slew each other before the 
eyes of mortals, until they walked back to their divine 
domains through the very streets of Waterdeep itself. 
Decades later, more deities began dying off, magic 
failed, and all manner of catastrophes started altering 
the very nature of the city. Lord Neverember wasted the 
city's navy and then, instead of rebuilding it, hired sail-
ors out of Mintarn (and profited from the endeavor). 
Now, the City of Splendors is on the mend. The harbor 
has been cleared of the broken ships that made up the 
former district of Mistshore, and Waterdeep again has 
its own navy. The city's Guard (its army), Watch (police 
force), Navy, and it famous Griffon Cavalry are all being 
reformed, but all of that might be a matter of years in 
the settling. A plague chased most residents out of the 
Warrens and Downshadow, and living or digging below 
the city's surface has been deemed illegal except by 
those authorized by the lords to do so. Somehow, even 
the air seems fresher. In the words of one wise moon elf 
matron (whose status as my aunt has positively no bear-
ing on her wisdom), "Waterdeep is back to where it was 
when I was a lass." 
Perhaps most surprising of the newest developments 
is the return of Laeral Silverhand to Waterdeep. Long 
thought dead, she reemerged only recently, and swiftly 
rallied the masked lords to support her supplanting of 
Dagult Neverember as Open Lord ofWaterdeep. Very 
few remember Lady Laeral from her previous time in 
the city, but those elves who have been living in there 
for the last century claim she is more reserved than 
she once was. The new Open Lord doesn't speak of her 
family- any mention of her children, her late husband 
(the fabled Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun), or any of her 
famed sisters is cause for her to cut short whatever 
conversation may be in progress at the time. Her rela-
tionship with the current Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr, is 
cordial, but the two are seldom seen in one-on-one con-
versation, and most think that Lady Laeral has little to 
learn from a mage who isn't nearly her equal. 
As always, the Open Lord is selected and supported 
by several masked lords, who bear masks, robes, and 
amulets to disguise themselves when publicly sitting in 
judgment or council, and who make policies for Water-
deep. Every Waterdhavian has suspicions as to whether 
this or that influential citizen is or isn't a lord of the city, 
and some are willing to make their beliefs public, but 
few who are confronted in such a way have ever claimed 
to be a lord, and none of those have also produced proof 
of that assertion. 
Not hidden at all are the other lords of the city- the 
nobles ofWaterdeep, whose high-nosed behavior and 
heavy-handed spending establish fashion in the city, 
which in turn creates trends all across the North for 
clothing, weaponry, favored trinkets, music, and any 
other preference that can be changed at a whim by 
those with enough coin to afford the expense. More than 
seventy-five noble families call Waterdeep home, repre-
senting between them all manner of business interests, 
rivalries, and internal strife. 
Being a noble carries with it a great deal of advantage. 
Operating from one's place at the head of the economic 
and social hierarchy, a noble can easily lift a mediocre 
craftperson out of obscurity, dash the hopes of a wealthy 
merchant of ever securing another contract within the 
city, or provide the backing an ambitious adventuring 
band needs to find fame and great wealth. The only 
true competition nobles face is from one another. Such 
rivalries are the source of much gossip and intrigue as
