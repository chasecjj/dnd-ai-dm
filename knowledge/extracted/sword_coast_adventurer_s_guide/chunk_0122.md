Some rogues have learned it is easier to pick some-
one's pocket when you have a royal writ, which is to say 
many rogues are diplomats, courtiers, influence-ped-
dlers, and information-brokers, in addition to the bet-
ter-known thieves and assassins. Such rogues blend 
more easily into civilized society, more often acting as 
grease in the wheels than a wrench in the works. 
ROGUISH ARCHETYPES 
Rogues in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Roguish Archetype options, in addition to those in the 
Player's Handbook . 
MASTERMIND 
Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets 
they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow 
this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your 
weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and 
favors are some of your favorite treasures. 
MASTER OF INTRIGUE 
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one 
gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages 
of your choice. 
Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech 
patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak 
for at least 1 minute, allowing you to pass yourself off as 
a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you 
know the language. 
MASTER OF TACTICS 
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a 
bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action 
to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that 
attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than 5 feet of 
you, if the target can see or hear you. 
INSIGHTFUL MANIPULATOR 
Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute 
observing or interacting with another creature outside 
combat, you can learn certain information about its 
capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if 
the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard 
to two of the following characteristics of your choice: 
• Intelligence score 
Wisdom score 
Charisma score 
Class levels (if any) 
At the DM's option, you might also realize you know 
a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality 
traits, if it has any. 
MISDIRECTION 
Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause an-
other creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When 
you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 
feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you 
can use your reaction to have the attack target that crea-
ture instead of you. 
SOUL OF DECEIT 
Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by 
telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can 
present false thoughts by making a Charisma (Decep-
tion) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (In-
sight) check. 
Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would 
determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are 
being truthful, if you so choose, and you can't be com-
pelled to tell the truth by magic. 
SWASHBUCKLER 
You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying 
on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While 
some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your 
method of fighting looks almost like a performance. Du-
elists and pirates typically belong to this archetype. 
A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can 
fight with two weapons while safely darting away from 
an opponent. 
FANCY FOOTWORK 
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn 
how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. 
During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a 
creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks 
against you for the rest of your turn.
