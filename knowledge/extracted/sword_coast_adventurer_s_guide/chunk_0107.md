A RACE WITHOUT A HOME 
As offspring of the infernal, tieflings call no place in 
Faerun their own, although some places and nations are 
more tolerant of them than most. 
In the North, the largest population of tieflings is 
found in Neverwinter. Since the Ashmadai, a violent cult 
dedicated to Asmodeus, is also active in the city, mis-
trust of tieflings isn't unusual even here, since folk never 
know if a tiefling is a member of the Ashmadai or was 
drawn to Neverwinter by the opportunity to blend in that 
a metropolis provides. 
Small and scattered groups of tieflings are found else-
where across Faerun, particularly in cosmopolitan cities 
(where they can be anonymous to some degree) and in 
rough and poor settlements that welcome anyone who 
can help them survive and prosper. 
Tieflings are common in Calimshan, to the south, 
where many of them fought for the djinn as mercenaries 
and now serve other masters with the coin to pay them. 
In the east, many tieflings dwell in Aglarond-escaped 
slaves from Thay or their descendants- and in Mul-
horand, where tieflings are believed to carry the blood of 
the ancient Mulhorandi gods themselves. 
LONE FAITHFUL 
Although many Faerunian folk believe that all tieflings 
worship Asmodeus and the Lords of the Nine Hells, the 
truth is that only a fraction of them do so, but enough 
are devil- or demon-worshipers to lend the weight of 
truth to all the rumors and suspicion. 
Tieflings who revere a god other than Asmodeus often 
worship deities who watch over and care for outsiders, 
including Ilmater, Mask, Selune, Shar, and Tymora. 
Gods of knowledge, survival, cunning, and warfare are 
also common attractions for tieflings who value those 
qualities. Beshaba has tiefling worshipers who consider 
the accident of their birth as a kind of cruel joke they 
have chosen to embrace. 
Equally intriguing and disturbing to followers of 
some faiths in Faerun are stories spread by tieflings 
who claim to have visions in which the gods of Faerun 
appear to them modeled in the tieflings' own image. One 
such is the entity they call the "pale horned goddess of 
the moon" (Selune); another is the "dark, devilish lady of 
fortune" (Tymora)- an indication, tieflings say, that one's 
outward appearance and bloodline are less important to 
the gods than the heart and soul within. 
TIEFLING NAMES 
A great many tiefling parents follow the naming conven-
tions of the culture in which their offspring are born, 
such as using human names if they live in a human set-
tlement (the better to seem like "normal" citizens). Oth-
ers take names derived from the Infernal language that 
have been passed down since ancient times. 
In addition, some Faerunian tieflings have names 
drawn from the language of cultures where they are rel-
atively common and generally accepted, such as Calish-
AASIMAR 
The celestial opposites of the tieflings, aasimar are de-
scended from humans of celestial heritage. Aasimar 
aren't as prevalent in the Realms as tieflings, but com-
mon enough that some become adventurers. Dungeon 
Masters who want to allow their players to create aasimar 
characters can find rules for doing so in the Dungeon Mas-
ter's Guide. 
ite and Mulhorandi, which are foreign-sounding to folk 
in the North and along the Sword Coast. 
Al-Khem and Beni-Asmodai are two common Calish-
ite tiefling surnames that proclaim the race's heritage, 
along with first names such as Haroun, Ishaq, and Ni-
zam (male) or Hania, Rashaa, and Zaar (female). 
Mulhorandi surnames that begin with "Sia" or "Zia" 
followed by a god's name indicate a bearer of that god's 
bloodline, such as Zianhur and Siasobek. First names 
commonly seen among Mulhorandi tieflings include 
Aybtep ("horned"), Bahati ("wise soul"), Het ("smoke"), 
Kamen ("dark"), Katsu ("star born"), and Kohl 
("dark eyed").
