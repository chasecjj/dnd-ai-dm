of other humanoid races, which were pale imitations of 
dragonborn perfection. Io shaped the dragonborn and 
fired them with his breath, then spilled his own blood 
to give them life. The first dragonborn served Io as 
companions and allies, filling his astral court and sing-
ing his praises. The dragons he made only later, at the 
start of the Dawn War, to serve as engines of destruc-
tion. This view of dragonborn history is shared by those 
who believe that dragonborn are superior to other races 
and thus should be the masters of dragons and not the 
other way around. 
Despite their differing conclusions, a common theme 
binds all these legends together: the dragonborn owe 
their existence to Io, the great dragon-god who created 
all of dragonkind. The dragonborn, all legends agree, 
are not the creations of Bahamut or Tiamat- and so 
they have no predetermined side in the conflict between 
those gods. Every individual dragonborn, regardless of 
one's particular draconic ancestry, makes a personal 
choice in matters of ethics and morality. 
THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM 
Dragon born hail from Abeir, the primordial twin of To-
ri!. On that world most of the dragonborn are slaves to 
their dragon masters, though many won their freedom 
and formed nations of free dragon born. During the 
Spellplague, the two worlds intersected and one of those 
free dragonborn nations, Tymanchebar, was transported 
to FaerG.n. It displaced the nation of Unther, and out of 
the ashes of these two kingdoms, the surviving drag-
onborn formed Tymanther, a new dragonborn nation 
in FaerG.n. 
For a time, the dragonborn of Tymanther sought to 
integrate with their new world while maintaining their 
own traditions and culture. These efforts gave the na-
tion and its people a reputation for being honorable and 
worthy of respect. Only a few generations later, however, 
the events of the Sundering returned Unther to FaerG.n, 
and the formerly displaced land sought to reclaim all it 
had lost to Tymanther. Reeling from this disaster, the re-
maining dragonborn in FaerG.n now find they must work 
even harder and with fewer resources to find their place 
among the people the world. 
HONOR AND FAMILY 
Every aspect of dragonborn life is dictated by the race's 
code of honor and strict adherence to tradition. Drag-
onborn society is highly ordered, with each member 
expected to do one's utmost for family and clan. This loy-
alty and sense of duty sustained the dragonborn during 
their long history of enslavement and also enabled them 
to form communities and nations of free dragon born. 
In dragonborn culture, the family is made up of one's 
direct relations, while a clan is a collection of families 
brought together by alliance, intermarriage, or shared 
history. Although they are rarely forced to choose one 
over the other, the clan's welfare is more important 
to most dragonborn than the family's. The promise of 
honor within the clan drives them to acts of heroism 
daring, or excellence, all meant to bring glory to the ~Ian 
first and the individual second. 
The aftermath of the Sundering has tested these prin-
ciples, leaving some clans fractured and decentralized. 
Some dragonborn in FaerG.n seek to recapture the sort 
of connection they had with a now-lost clan or family by 
forging new relationships among their non-dragonborn 
allies and companions. 
Dragonborn in FaerG.n have the racial traits of dragon-
born in the Player's Handbook. 
PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 
Their code of honorable behavior and unswerving 
loyalty serves the dragonborn as a kind of faith, and, 
according to the traditionalists among them, that out-
look is all the religion they need. Because they were 
forced to worship their draconic masters in times past, 
dragonborn are generally skeptical about religion, see-
ing it as a form of servitude. The skeptics believe that 
no matter how their original god, Io, brought them into 
being, that ancient deity is either long dead or uncaring 
about their fate, and the dragon gods that supplanted Io 
seem primarily interested in amassing soldiers for their 
ages-old conflict. 
Still, some dragonborn do hear the call of the gods 
of FaerG.n and choose to serve them, and are as loyal in 
this faith as they are to any other cause. Bahamut and 
Tiamat have dragonborn worshipers, and both Torm 
and Tyr appeal to the dragonborn sense of honor and
