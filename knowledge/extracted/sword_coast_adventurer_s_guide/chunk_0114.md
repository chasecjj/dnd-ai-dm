Dancing Place in the high valleys of the Thunder Peaks, 
alongside their fey allies. The Watchers of S evreld meet 
in Old Mushroom Grove in the High Forest, northeast 
.of Secomber, and the Starwater Circle gathers around 
their namesake pool in the northern forest of Mir. 
THE CIRCLE OF SWORDS 
Protectors of the Neverwinter Wood, the Circle of 
Swords drives destructive humanoids like hobgoblins, 
bugbears, and their kin from the wood, while also safe-
guarding it against exploitation at the hands of civilized 
folk and protecting the wood's ancient ruins and sacred 
sites from looters. 
In the Druid Circle class feature in the Player's Hand-
book, the Circle of the Moon is common for Circle of 
Swords druids, although some belong to the Circle of 
the Land (Forest). 
THE EMERALD ENCLAVE 
Less a druid circle and more a loose confederation of 
circles and their allies, the Emerald Enclave is devoted 
to protecting the redoubt of civilization in the North 
from destruction. Elsewhere in the world, the Emerald 
Enclave must pursue a more balanced path, but the vast 
wilderness of the North holds far more danger to people 
than they pose to it. 
Founded in the Vilhon Reach over a thousand years 
ago, the Emerald Enclave has spread across much of 
Faerfin. Its members include druids, rangers, barbar-
ians, and others who live in the wilderness and know 
and respect its ways. They wear an article of emerald 
green clothing as a symbol of their membership, often 
bearing the emblem of a stag's head. 
In the Druid Circle class feature in the Player's Hand-
book, Emerald Enclave druids belong to the Circle of the 
Land and Circle of the Moon in equal measure. 
THE MOONSHEA CIRCLES 
The Ffolk of the Moonshea Isles venerate the land as 
the great goddess they call the Earthmother. Their cir-
cles gather around sacred pools known as moonwells, 
their link between the natural world and the goddess, 
ringed by standing stone circles, raised by their ancient 
ancestors. 
In the Druid Circle class feature in the Player's Hand-
book, Moonshea druids most often belong to the Circle 
of the Land (Coast, Forest, and Mountain). 
MOONWELLS 
The water of a moonwell, drunk directly from cupped 
hands, restores ld8 hit points, plus the drinker's Wis-
dom bonus, if any .. If the drinker has threatened the bal-
ance of nature since the last full moon, the water instead 
deals ld8 poison damage to the drinker. This damage 
is also dealt by a corrupted moonwell. Either effect oc-
curs once only per day per drinker. On the nights of the 
full moon, drinkin·g the water of a moonwell can, at the 
DM's discretion, have additional effects, such as confer-
ring the benefits of a lesser restoration spell. 
THE HA RP ERS AN D DRUIDS 
Druid circles in the North are often allied with the Harpers, 
as they have common purpose, with bards and rangers 
serving as go-betweens. Individual Harpers can usually ex-
pect a circle to at least grant them food and shelter, and an 
opportunity to attend a gathering and speak, if they wish. 
Still, the Harpers aren 't a druidic organization and, 
despite what some common folk might believe, not every 
druid or dru id circle is allied with, or even friendly toward, 
the Harpers and their cause. Indeed, some druids consider 
the Harpers busybodies who threaten the natural balance 
almost as much as the evils that they fight against. 
Moonwell water placed in a container or taken more 
than 30 feet away from the well no longer has any of 
these properties; it is simply water. 
On the three nights of the full moon, three or more 
druids gathered around a moonwell can cast commune 
and scrying once each without expending spell slots and 
without material components, provided that one of the 
druids is at least 9th level and the rest are at least 4th 
level. At the DM's option, the druids can use a moonwell 
on such nights to cast different spells. 
FIGHTERS 
"SLOW TO LEARN, AREN'T THEY?" A WHJTE- HAJRED OLD 
knight who'd lost his helm in the last fray drawled. "This is 
getting to be like a proper romp in the Dragonjaws, it is! I'll 
have to get my minstrel to write a ballad about this ... " 
"I hope he sings swiftly," a Purple Dragon armsman 
growled. "Here they are!" 
The howling spilled over the bodies in another rushing 
tide of flapping leather, slashing swords, and beady goblin 
eyes. Men planted themselves- no running and leaping 
now-to hew steadily, like harvesters with scy thes and many 
fields in front of them, in a rhy thm of death. 
-Troy Denning, Death of the Dragon 
Whether doughty warriors, idealistic young soldiers, or 
hard-bitten mercenaries, fighters are found everywhere 
in the Forgotten Realms. Even the most peaceful lands 
have militia for protection against their enemies, and 
many great rulers in the Realms' past were fighters of 
some sort. There are always opportunities for those 
who know how to handle themselves in a fight. 
Able-bodied folk in many parts of the Sword Coast 
and the North learn at least the rudiments of combat 
as part of a local militia, serving in times of need, while 
a few go on to become professional soldiers, guards, 
or the like. Officers tend to come from the nobility, al-
though there are opportunities for capable leaders to 
demonstrate their skills and rise through the ranks. 
Fighters who don't make a career of soldiering find 
other ways to demonstrate their prowess. Mercenaries 
find employment with those who need skilled warriors 
but who lack the time or means to train them. Such 
employers include adventuring companies, which are 
almost always in need of a reliable fighter.
