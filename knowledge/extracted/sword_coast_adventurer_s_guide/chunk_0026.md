THE LEGEND OF KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE 
Long ago there was but one god of strife, death, and the 
dead, an.d he was known as jergal, Lord of the End of Every-
thing. jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals 
and deific entities alike. When beings slew each other in their 
quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into 
his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, 
everything came to him eventually, and over time he built a 
kingdom unchallenged by any other god. But he grew tired of 
his duties, for he knew them too well, and without challenge 
there is nothing-and in nothingness there is only gloom. 
In such a state, the difference between absolute power and 
absolute powerlessness is -undetectable. 
During this dark era arose three powerful mortals-Bane, 
Bhaal, and Myrkul-who lusted after the power jergal pos-
sessed. The trio forged an unholy pact that they would gain 
such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length 
and breadth of the world they strode, seeking powerful magic 
and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what 
monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three 
mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually, the 
trio journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle 
of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, 
hordes of wraiths, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. 
Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest- the 
Bone Throne. 
"I claim this throne of evil," Bane the tyrant shouted 
to jergal. 
"I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened 
Bhaal the assassin. 
"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised 
Myrkul the necromancer. 
jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and 
said, "The throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty 
power. Take it if you wish-I promise to serve and guide 
you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the 
position." Then, before the stunned trio could react, the Lord 
of the Dead asked, "Who among you shall rule?" 
The trio immediately fell to fighting among themselves 
while jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually 
it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or 
common in places where an individual's grave or tomb 
isn't marked with the person's name. 
Few people favor Jergal as a deity, and most who do 
are concerned with the dispensation of the dead in some 
way. Priests ofJergal serve communities as undertakers 
and caretakers of gravesites. Jergal has no temples ded-
icated to him aside from abandoned places devoted to 
his old, darker incarnation, but his priests are welcome 
in the temples of Kelemvor, Deneir, and Myrkul. His

battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything 
intervened. 
"After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with 
nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office by 
engaging in a game of skill for them?" asked jergal. 
Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and 
agreed to it. So jergal took the skulls of his three most pow-
erful liches and gave them to the trio so they could compete 
in skull bowling. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray 
Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who 
bowled the farthest. 
Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit jergal at this moment. 
After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would 
receive all of jergal's power, he chased off after the three 
skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he 
had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, 
and Myrkul again fell to fighting, as it was obvious their sport 
had been ruined, but again jergal intervened. "Why don't you 
allow Lady Luck to decide, so you don't have to share with 
the Beast?" 
The trio agreed to this alternative, and jergal broke off his 
skeletal finger bones and gave them to the contestants. When 
Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio 
had just finished a game of knucklebones. 
Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule 
for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and 
strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in 
my kingdom." 
Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose 
the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all that you are 
lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die-
even gods." 
Bhaal, who finished third, proclaimed, "I choose death, and 
it is by my hand that all that you rule, Lord Bane, will eventu-
ally pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me 
and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, 
by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, 
Myrkul, by staying my hand." 
Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and so 
yet again only the beasts were left for him. 
And jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.

sites where records of that sort are kept.
