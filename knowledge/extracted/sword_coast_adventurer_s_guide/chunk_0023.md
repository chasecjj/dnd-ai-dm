DENE IR 
The Lord of All Glyphs and Images, the First Scribe, the 
Scribe of Oghma 
Deneir is the god of literature and literacy, the patron of 
the artist and the scribe. His is the power to accurately 
render and describe, to write and to read, and to pass 
on information. In legend, Deneir is often portrayed as 
being a scribe in service to Oghma, and he is sometimes 
thought of as Oghma's right hand. 
It's common practice for someone who writes a let-
ter or records information to say a prayer to Deneir to 
avoid mistakes. Similarly, artists acknowledge Deneir 
before beginning and upon completing paintings, par-
ticularly illuminations on manuscripts, tapestries that 
relate stories, and any such attempt to use art to capture 
the truth. 
Followers of Deneir believe that information not re-
corded and saved for later use is information lost. They 
consider literacy an important gift of the gods, one that 
should be spread and taught. His followers are scribes 
and scholars devoted, like their patron, to preserving 
written works, and also to experiencing them, for they 
say that Deneir himself is hidden within the lines, 
shapes, and passages of all written works. Priests of 
Deneir take an oath of charity as well, compelling them 
to accept the requests of others to write letters and tran-
scribe information. 
The god's followers tend to be individualists, united 
by their shared faith but not overly concerned with reli-
gious hierarchy and protocol. This behavior is supported 
by the fact that Deneir's blessings of divine magic are 
more often bestowed on those who lose themselves in 
written works than on those who fancy themselves part 
of any temple or religious order. Contemplation of the 
faith's most holy book, the Tome of Universal Harmony, 
is the most effective way to become deserving of Dene-
ir's blessings.

CHAPTER 1 I WELCOME TO THE REALMS 
ELDA TH 
The Quiet One, the Guardian of Groves, the Mother of 
the Waters 
Eldath is the goddess of waterfalls, springs, pools, still-
ness, peace, and quiet glades. She is thought to be pres-
ent at many such places, particularly those that serve as 
druid groves. Eldath is a goddess of comfort, healing, 
and calm. Her blessed waters heal the sick, cure mad-
ness, and comfort the dying. 
Most rural places have a pond or a glade that locals 
ascribe to Eldath. Tradition dictates that it be a place of 
quiet reflection where others are left to their thoughts. A 
body of water such as a pond or a spring typically serves 
as a repository of offerings. If the holy site is a glade, a 
stream one crosses along the way might serve as the re-
pository, or a prominent bush or tree in the glade might 
be the place where people tie offerings. Typical offerings 
are broken weapons or items that are remembrances of 
arguments, which the faithful discard while making a 
wish for peace in the future. Many of those who favor El-
dath are pacifists or people who are troubled by violence 
they have witnessed or experienced. 
Eldath's priests don't organize into large sects. Indeed, 
many are itinerant, wandering between various holy 
sites and shrines, seeing that the locations are cared 
for and that they remain places of sweet serenity. The 
faithful of Eldath are usually close to nature, and allied 
to druids, who count Eldath among the First Circle. It 
is taboo to strike a priest of Eldath, and killing one is 
said to bring great misfortune. Despite the measure of 
protection that this belief affords them, most priests of 
Eldath avoid conflicts rather than attempting to quell 
them. Those who serve Eldath are happy to preside over 
peaceful negotiations and to certify treaties, but they 
can't force others to engage in harmony. 
GOND 
The Wonderbringer, the Inspiration Divine, the Holy 
Maker of All Things 
Gond is the god of artifice, craft, and construction. He is 
revered by blacksmiths, woodworkers, engineers, and 
inventors. Anyone who is crafting something might say 
a prayer to Gond to guide the work, but folk know that 
Gond smiles most brightly upon new inventions that 
others find useful. 
Priests of Gond wander the North dressed in saffron 
vestments, adorned with sashes that contain within
