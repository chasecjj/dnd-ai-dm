TH E CRE ST 
OF ELTURGARD 
that brought about the nation of Elturgard, and perhaps 
that divine provenance will preserve it. 
It began, as all the great stories do, in darkness. Half a 
century ago, the city of Elturel was a petty power. It had 
claimed its neighbors' territory under various excuses, 
putting them under "Elturel's Guard." Then, the city's 
leader, its High Rider, was revealed to be a vampire. The 
extent of the vampire's network of charmed servants, 
undead allies, and willing sycophants took the Hellrid-
ers by surprise. An undead plague swamped Elturel, 
and although its Hellriders made some gains by day, 
in darkness the vampire and its minions inflicted cruel 
losses. Each night the good people of Elturel prayed to 
the gods that dawn might come more swiftly. 
Then, on a particularly disastrous night when all 
seemed lost, dawn did come. A warm golden light 
suffused the city and surrounding lands, cast down 
from a golden orb that hung unwavering in the sky, so 
bright that it seemed a new day had dawned. Caught 
outside when this miracle appeared, the High Rider 
and his vampire spawn burned away to dust, and the 
other undead quailed in its illumination. In short order, 
Elturel was free. 
When the true dawn came, the new sun remained. 
And it stayed in the sky through the next night, and the 
night after, and each night from then until now. While 
some called it Amaunator's Gift, none could say what 
god granted them this boon. Most saw it as a companion 
to the sun and to themselves, and so it is known as the 
Companion. This holy wonder brought pilgrims of all 
kinds to Elturel. The devout, the curious, the afflicted-
all came to bathe in its warmth and see its blessed light 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
by night. Paladins had always been small in number 
among the Hellriders, but the Companion drew many to 
Elturgard, and the best among them was named High 
Observer to rule in the High Rider's place. 
To maintain order among the many faiths of the pal-
adins, a special knighthood was created, named after 
the Companion sun. These paladins swore to uphold the 
Creed Resolute, an oath of service to Elturgard and all 
good people. And thus Elturgard now has both the Com-
panions and the Hellriders. 
The post of High Observer is no longer occupied by a 
paladin, but by a priest of Torm named Thavus Kreeg, 
and this to me seems fitting. Paladins should be out in 
the world, using their divine gifts for the good of all, 
not signing documents behind some desk or dithering 
with dignitaries. High Observer Kreeg has ruled wisely 
and well these past forty years or so, but as a short-
lived human, he is nearing the end of his years. When 
he passes or can no longer cope with the demands of 
his office, I hope that Elturgard can make a smooth 
transition to equally strong leadership. It is during such 
change and the struggles for power that result that 
humans often stray from the righteous path. Perhaps 
the light of the Companion will show them the way. 
ELTUREL'S GUARD 
Sometimes called the Kingdom of Two Suns, Elturgard 
encompasses Elturel, Triel, Scornubel, Soubar, and 
Berdusk. It also claims and protects many small villages 
and farms strung along the roads and rivers in the West-
ern Heartlands. 
The heraldry of Elturgard-the sun and a smaller com-
panion sun surrounded in a blaze- is familiar to many 
of us along the roads that lead to and through Elturgard, 
for it also blazons the armor and flags of its two groups 
of guardians, the Hellriders and the Companions. 
It might be fairly said that the only reason Elturgard 
can exist as a nation is because of these knights, for it 
faces threats from all around. The wilderness to the 
south is home to ravenous monsters, and the serpent 
kingdom of Najara to the north routinely sends agents-
both raiders and spies- to test the strength of Elturgard. 
The knights can't afford to be anything but vigilant, and 
fortunately for the folk of Elturgard, they are just that. 
I regard crossing the border into Elturgard as a relief, 
for it usually means the beginning of a safe haven, with 
a need to set fewer guards at night. Many adventurers 
find good cause to visit Elturgard, whether pursuing 
personal goals or seeking sanctuary from the dangers 
that surround the small nation. Additionally, the High 
FORT MORNINCLORD 
Several years ago, the entire complement of paladins at 
Fort Morninglord simply disappeared. The High Observer 
at the time ordered the fort, a day's ride west of Elturel, 
to be bricked up, and the curious forbidden entrance, for 
fear of what evil they might release into the world. The fort 
remains sealed today, and guards occupy a fortified en-
campment nearby. The camp serves as a base from wh ich 
the paladins of Elturgard can patrol this area of the nation, 
and also as a deterrent to adventurers and other ne'er-do-
wells who might otherwise try to find whatever is trapped 
in the fort's depths.
