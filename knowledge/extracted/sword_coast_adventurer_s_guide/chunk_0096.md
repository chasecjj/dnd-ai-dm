beauty, art, and enchantment; and the Moonlit Mystery, 
silver Sehanine Moonbow, goddess of all life's myster-
ies, including mysticism, prophecy, death, and dreams. 
In legends, these goddesses are often separate entities 
from Angharradh, and frequently depicted as Correl-
lon's daughters or consorts. 
GODS OF NATURE 
Deep Sashelas is a sea god, lord of the sea elves and of 
dolphins. Labelas Enoreth is the philosopher god, deity 
of time and history, whose gift of trance is crucial to 
elven identity and survival. Rillifane Rallathil is god of 
the woodlands and the wild places, the father of wood 
elves and protector of druids. Closely allied with him 
is Solonar Thelandira, the god of hunting, archery, and 
woodcraft. 
GODS OF SHADOW 
Of somewhat darker bent, Erevan Ilesere is a deity of 
mischief, a trickster-god; and Fenmarel Mestarine is the 
moody and sullen god of outcasts and solitude, who has 
little to do with the rest of the Seldarine (except for Ere-
van who uses Fenmarel as a scapegoat in his plots and 
pra~ks). And then there is Shevarash, a god thought of 
as embittered and obsessive, to whom elves turn when 
they seek vengeance. 
FAERUNIAN GODS 
Many elves worship deities in the Faerfinian pantheon, 
including Mielikki (and the unicorn goddess Lurue), Sil-
vanus, and Sune. In recent years, some elves have found 
delight in the worship of Lathander, as well. 
DROW DEITIES 
The gods of the drow are fractious and treacherous as 
their worshipers. 
The Spider Queen. Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spi-
ders, reigns supreme as goddess of the drow, ruthlessly 
eliminating all who would threaten her position. Her 
priestesses do likewise with the cults of rival gods 
among their people. 
Other Dark Powers. Selvetarm is god of warriors, 
and therefore patron of male drow, although perhaps 
not so much as Vhaeraun, the rogue god of thievery 
and of drow males who rebel against the matriarchy. 
Kiaransalee, drow goddess of the undead, is served by 
secretive cults of necromancers. Ghaunadaur, known 
as That Which Lurks, is a subversive power, the mad 
god of oozes, rebels, and outcasts, occasionally re-
vered by drow. 
The Dark Maiden. Some drow exiles have heard the 
song of Eilistraee, urging them out onto the surface to 
behold the moon as it rises. The drow goddess of song, 
beauty, swordwork, hunting, and moonlight, she is the 
patron of drow who reject the evils of their society, offer-
ing them light and hope. 
HALFLINGS 
Folk think of elves as aloof and graceful, dwarves as 
fierce and hardy, and of gnomes- if they think of them 
at all- as clever and shy. Halflings, in contrast, have the 
reputation of being deft and plucky. 
Halflings, or hin as they call themselves, exhibit a 
natural adroitness that often surprises larger folk. This 
nimbleness regularly comes in handy when their cour-
age outruns their common sense, and tales about hal-
flings abound with lucky breaks and narrow escapes. 
Beyond these typical elements of the halfling charac-
ter, halflings can be divided into two major subraces. 
Many aspects of the two groups' cultures make them 
distinct, but even without such trappings they are dis-
tinct due to a divergence in what seems to be a primal 
drive: to go or to stay. Lightfoot halflings are travelers as 
a rule, with tongues and hearts as nimble as their feet. 
Whereas if strongheart halflings are on the move, it al-
ways seems driven by a desire to return to home or find 
and settle in a new one. As the saying goes, "Lightfoot, 
light hearted. Strongheart, strong footing."
