with items that remind others of the sea's dangerous 
nature- a necklace of shark teeth, seaweed wrapped 
about a h1,1man bone, and so on. The preserved hand of 
a drowned person is thought to be a particularly holy ob-
ject, and some of her few clerics use such severed hands 
as holy symbols. Umberlee does have a large number of 
shrines in the coastal cities, and sailors often leave flow-
ers or small candies at them in hopes that she will spare 
them on their next voyage. Both Waterdeep and Baldur's 
Gate have true temples dedicated to Umberlee, staffed 
largely by the widows of sailors lost at sea. 
WAUKEEN 
Our Lady of Gold, the Coinmaiden, the Merchant's 
Friend 
Waukeen is the goddess of wealth and trade, on both 
sides of the law. Her most ardent worshipers include 
shopkeepers, members of trading costers, wealthy 
merchants, caravan guides, itinerant peddlers, money-
changers, and smugglers. She is interested in anything 
that increases trade and the flow of money, whether new 
trade routes, new inventions, or the whim of changing 
fashion. Those who take Waukeen as a patron can be re-
liably thought of as greedy, but the Coinmaiden is said to 
frown upon misers and smile upon the industrious and 
the profligate, and thus priests who bear her holy sym-
bol find themselves welcome in many towns and cities. 
Temples ofWaukeen resemble guildhalls and often 
serve as meeting places for trade consortiums. Those 
who follow Waukeen's ethos seek to create more op-
portunity for all and see competition for wealth as one 
of society's main means of progress. Thus, the faithful 
of Our Lady of Gold often find themselves at odds with 
trade guilds and others who would form monopolies. It's 
common practice among those who seek Waukeen's fa-
vor to set aside a tithe of ten percent of their profits, but 
rather than being given to a temple, the money is meant 
to be spent to help a struggling business, to finance a 
new endeavor, or, if all else fails, on frivolous fun. 
SYMBOL OF' U MBERLEE 
THE Goos OF MULHORAND 
People of Faerun refer to M ulhorand as one of the Old 
Empires, but most don 't know that Mulhorand is in 
fact the oldest human empire still in existence on the 
continent. Mulhorand's pantheon of deities, sometimes 
called god-kings or pharaohs, can trace their lineage even 
farther back. 
According to the demigods enthroned in Mulhorand, the 
ancestors of the Mulhorandi people were brought from 
another world and enslaved by the lmaskari in an ancient 
empire deep in what is now Raurin, the Dust Desert. When 
the gods of those ancestors heard the pleas of their distant 
fa ithful, they set out in a great celestial ark guided by the 
entity known as Ptah. Upon arriving in the world, two of 
the deities, Re and En Iii, set about empowering the slaves 
and fomenting rebellion. 
The revolt succeeded, but Re and Enlil couldn't keep 
peace with one another. Each then founded a separate 
dynasty of divine mortals, Re in Mulhorand, and Enlil 
(father of Gilgeam) in Unther. Re and his related deities 
ruled Mulhorand through mortal incarnations for thou-
sands of years. 
Time took its toll, and the attention the deities of Mul-
horand paid to their followers wavered and diminished. 
Each new incarnation of Isis, Osiris, and Thoth was a little 
more human and a little less divine. When the magically 
powerful lmaskari returned with a vengeance a little over 
a century ago, they stole the scepter of rulership from a 
grasp so weak it barely had any strength left. 
Although Mulhorand's conquerors outlawed slavery in 
the area they now called High lmaskar, the Mulhorandi 
people recognized the yoke they now bore. The lmaskari 
were the new coming of the slavemasters of old, as depict-
ed in the carvings in the pharaohs' tombs. Many prayed 
that the vanished gods would return and once again free 
them from lmaskari rule, and during the Sundering, that is 
what happened. What were referred to as Chosen in other 
lands were recognized in Mulhorand as living gods, come 
to lead the Mulhorandi in an uprising. 
Today Mulhorand is ruled by demigods that call them-
selves by such names as Re, Anhur, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, 
Set, and Thoth. They take different forms, some human 
and others tieflings or aasimar, but all speak and act 
like the gods of legend come to life, which they must be. 
This family of deities bears the scars of all the past loves, 
rivalries, and wars between them, but for now they have 
set their differences aside for the betterment of Mul-
horand and its people, and the people of Mulhorand love 
them for it.
