neighborhoods organizing their own makeshift militias, 
and the Lord Protector wants to avoid conflict between 
them and the mercenaries he has hired. As a result, 
Neverember has slowly been drawing down the number 
of soldiers from Mintarn, as the citizens that grew up 
defending the makeshift Wall from threats out of the 
Chasm prove themselves capable of becoming a proper 
military force. Both Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep have 
offered to help train the new guards of Neverwinter, but 
Lord Neverember prefers the assistance of seasoned 
adventurers to the ignominy of seeking help from his 
former city. 
With the restoration of nearby Gauntlgrym, Never-
winter hopes to have a close ally that can provide it 
with stout armor and strong weapons. Although the 
city presently has little to offer, trade activity is rapidly 
growing in Neverwinter, as word of its rebirth opens 
it up to shipping from the Sea of Swords, goods from 
the north, and coin from the south. Adventurers come 
to Neverwinter seeking work and following rumors of 
nearby treasures, and often find additional employment 
clearing out dangerous corners of the city and escort-
ing the ever more numerous caravans up and down the 
High Road. It is the Lord Protector's hope that, with 
commerce and income both on the rise, and talented

craftfolk returning to ply their trades, that Neverwinter 
will someday again be worthy of its former epithet: the 
City of Skilled Hands. 
Opposition to Neverember's authority still exists, but 
with no unified leadership and no other power in the 
city to which to appeal, the rebels are slowly turning 
away from their resistance and toward helping the city 
rebuild. Many of the Sons of Alagondar, a rebel group 
that initially opposed Lord Neverember, have begun to 
volunteer as replacements for the Mintarn mercenaries 
currently patrolling the city. If the Sons of Alagondar 
can be brought into line with his goals, Neverember 
hopes to use that achievement as a draw for wealthy 
Waterdhavian nobles- who have been reluctant to link 
their fortunes to a failed Open Lord who was effectively 
exiled from Waterdeep- to invest in the city and perhaps 
rebuild some of the noble villas in that district as places 
for them to stay when they do business. 
With the Chasm closed, and the wall that separated 
the rest of the city from its horrors now torn down, a 
great swath of Neverwinter lies empty, with no inhab-
itants and plentiful chunks of stone plundered from 
ruins all across the city. Anyone who is willing to do 
so can come to this area, claim a portion of land, and 
build a structure in which to live or work. There aren't

yet any guilds to restrict trade or construction, and no 
nobles to be petitioned or placated. Those seeking to 
create a home or start a business can simply do so, and 
even those without skills or money can use their hands 
and backs to provide until they can set up a place for 
themselves. 
Along the river, many of the merchant villas are being 
claimed and restored by folk who have heard rumors of 
what Neverwinter once was, and might be again. Some 
have no skills to speak of, and many have no wealth, 
but all come with the desire to work and to enrich them-
selves in the process. New stores and workshops open 
by the tenday, and workers without training offer their 
services as laborers or apprentices; those that fail move 
on to other employment, taking advantage of the mul-
titude of opportunities the city now offers. Those with 
no other options can get work dredging or mapping the 
city's sewers for the Lord Protector, a task made neces-
sary by the cataclysm that created the Chasm. 
Like any city, Neverwinter isn't without its drawbacks. 
Though most folk are willing to work, some steal as a 
means of making their living, and prey upon those who 
have little to be taken. Food is sometimes scarce, as 
inns and taverns underestimate the number of guests 
they will receive, or merchants simply run out of goods 
to sell. It's likely to be a few years before the city entirely 
shakes itself of these ills, but for some, the uncertainties 
of life in Neverwinter are what make the place exciting. 
For many traders, in particular those who produce or 
vend the grains and vegetables needed in the city, it is 
a vast opportunity to both aid a fledgling power and get 
quite rich in doing so. 
SILVERYMOON 
Long a powerful and influential member of the Lords' 
Alliance- and, for its entire existence, the Silver 
Marches of Luruar- Silverymoon is what many cities 
aspire to be: a quiet, peaceful realm, where many races 
live together for common knowledge, celebration, and 
defense. The city is peopled primarily by the "goodly" 
races (humans, dwarves, gnomes, elves, halflings, and 
half-elves), but no being is turned away from Silvery-
moon because of its race- though a drow or an ore 
proving true to one's blood is sure to be punished in 
full for transgressing against the peace of the city. I will 
make no secret of my love for my home in the following 
summary, but I will endeavor to be as evenhanded as I 
can in describing it. 
The Gem of the North is a stunning place of sweeping 
curves, soaring towers, and structures built into the 
living trees. To many elves, the city is a reminder of the 
ancient elven cities of old; some call it the Myth Drannor 
of the North, even nowadays after the restoration and 
subsequent fall of that fabled city. Even where stone is 
employed in construction, ivy and other living plants 
grow through, over, or around most structural elements, 
giving most of the city a green cast. 
Despite its arboreal architecture, Silverymoon is 
very much civilized, boasting schools of music and 
magic, a great library, bardic instruction, and temples 
or shrines to Mielikki, Oghma, Silvanus, Sune, Tymora, 
and Mystra. Knowledge, both the acquisition of it and 
the wisdom that comes from diligent study, is the real 
treasure of Silverymoon, as much as magic or wealth 
could ever be. 
While it is easy and pleasing enough to get lost among 
the trees of the city, anyone who comes close enough 
to the River Raurin is awed by the vision of the Moon-
bridge: the great arch of silvery force that spans the 
water. Even for those native to the city, it is a powerful, 
moving sight, and some claim to see the goddess Lurue 
(for whom the city is named) dancing above the motes of 
the bridge when no one else is watching. 
Given its beauty, a visit to Silverymoon is among the 
most memorable experiences most non-Silvaeren might 
have. Even among those that regularly fight monsters or 
handle magic, Silverymoon is a place of quiet, contem-
plative beauty, splendid opportunities for learning, and 
respite from the harsher realities of the North. 
Folk seeking knowledge that has been lost or hidden 
often come to Silverymoon seeking a means to find it, 
whether by studying in the Vault of the Sages or perus-
ing the Map House for the location of a lost city or grove. 
These are but two of the many buildings and houses 
of learning in the Conclave of Silverymoon, the great 
center of knowledge and wisdom that forms much of the 
city's southern part. If a map, a book, or a spell exists 
anywhere in Faerun, knowledge of it likely exists here, 
even if only a mere mention in a tome or a recollection 
of one of the city's great sages. Candlekeep might be the 
greatest assembly of written knowledge anywhere in 
the world, but in the end, that place represents accumu-
lation for its own sake. Silverymoon is where study and 
wisdom are honored. If your charge is to translate an 
ancient tome in a lost language, to learn the proper into-
nation of a complex song, or to better understand the 
cryptic writings of a long-dead sage, there is no better 
place to seek aid than Silverymoon. 
It is an easy thing to come to Silverymoon seek-
ing knowledge of one subject, and find oneself so 
enraptured by the study that it takes a lifetime to accom-
plish- or to realize that it was the study, rather than 
the sought-after fact, that one truly desired. Although 
tutors and sages in every field can be found In Silvery-
moon, rarely is interaction with one so simple as to ask 
a question and be provided an answer. Learning to cast 
a particular spell, to find an ancient ruin, or understand 
a specific secret might involve undergoing months of
