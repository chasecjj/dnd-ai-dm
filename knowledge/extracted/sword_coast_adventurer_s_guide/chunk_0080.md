the majority of the denizens in these lands are lizard-
folk. Once a Netherese principality, ruled by vampires, 
and then a holding of the Zhentarim, the Marsh of 
Chelimber is solidly within the grasp of Najara today. 
Though each tribe of lizardfolk is dominated by a chief-
tain from among their kind, each of those leaders has 
sworn fealty to the King of Najara. 
FOREST OF WYRMS 
In the end, it was through the Forest of Wyrms that I 
fled Najara, though Dhosun advised me against doing 
so. Ultimately, I chose it for the same reason he tried 
to discourage me: because only a fool would enter this 
wood intentionally. The forest is infested with a great 
many serpents of both normal and monstrous varieties. 
Sages who have studied the serpent-life of the forest 
claim that some force seems to draw ophidian creatures 
here and then changes them- varieties of snake that 
ought not be poisonous bite with envenomed fang in this 
forest, and most breeds of snake grow to nearly double 
their size here. Ralionate, an ancient green dragon 
apparently not aligned with the yuan-ti, makes this 
forest her lair. It is good terrain for her; tall redwoods 
and coarse pines create a dense, dark canopy. 
Dhosun warned me that the ruins of Ss'thar'tiss'ssun, 
an ancient temple-city, lie in the northern fringes of the 
forest. At some point in the distant past, humans built 
a small settlement, once called Serpent's Cowl, above 
these ruins, but it now stands empty, likely due to the 
depredations of yuan-ti. Though discernible as little

more than low hills in the forest today, Dhosun told me 
that deep inside the ruins lies the Shrine of the Cowled 
Serpents, a site of pilgrimage for the serpent-folk. 
A place of great danger within the forest is Thlohtzin, 
once the citadel of a lich and now an important site in 
Najara's slave trade. Slavers from around the region 
know that the serpent-folk pay good coin for slaves 
brought here. They are then usually transported to other 
places in Najara for service. 
I chose to make my escape from Najara through the 
Forest of Wyrms because, though serpent-infested, it 
is a woodland yet, and I am at home in such places. I 
moved through its shadows, remaining deep enough 
within the forest to avoid notice but not so far as to come 
near its heart, and then skirted its edges until I could 
see the hills of Tri el ta in the distance. 
TRIELTA HILLS 
In the rolling terrain of the Trielta Hills, scattered with 
small settlements of gnomes and halflings, life seems 
pastoral and idyllic. Halfting farmers tend to their plots, 
and gnome miners scrape out the interior of the hills 
seeking the bits of gold and silver they may find waiting 
there. No warlords threaten this land, no liches or drag-
ons plot to seize it for themselves. There are no great 
castles to covet here, nor ruins to pillage. All told, the 
place seems dull and unremarkable. 
That, of course, is just the way its residents like it. 
They enjoy their solitude, which is broken only rarely.
