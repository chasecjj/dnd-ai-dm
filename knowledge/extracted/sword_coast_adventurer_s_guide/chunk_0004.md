The Lords' Alliance includes the strongest mercantile 
powers of the North. In addition to providing military 
support and a forum for the peaceful airing of differ-
ences, the Alliance has always acted under the principle 
that communities with common cause that engage in 
trade are less likely to go to war with one another. By 
maintaining strong trade ties within the alliance as well 
as outside it, the Lords' Alliance helps to keep the peace. 
DWARFHOLDS OF THE NORTH 
The various dwarven communities of the North are the 
heirs and survivors of Delzoun, the great Northkingdom 
of long ago. Despite continually warring over the centu-
ries with the ores and goblinoids of the region, and hav-
ing to fight off assaults from below by duergar and drow, 
the shield dwarves have stood fast, determined to hold 
their halls against all threats- and, when necessary, 
reclaim them. 
Holds that survive from the days of Delzoun include 
Mithra! Hall, Citadel Adbar, and Citadel Felbarr. The 
fabled city of Gauntlgrym, built by the Delzoun dwarves 
and recently taken back from the drow, stands as a 
beacon of resurgent dwarven strength in the North. 
Stoneshaft Hold and Ironmaster are lonely settlements 
continually girding themselves for threats real and 
imagined. Sundabar and Mirabar are also generally 
considered dwarfholds, despite their substantial human 
populations. 
Until recently, many of the dwarfholds were members 
of the Silver Marches (also known as Luruar), an alli-

ance of cities that provided mutual protection across the 
North. Disagreements and failed obligations during a 
war with the ore kingdom of Many-Arrows destroyed the 
remaining trust between members of the Marches, and 
that pact is no more. The dwarfholds still ally with one 
another, and individually with nearby human realms, 
but no longer pledge to stand unified with all their 
neighbors. 
ISLAND KINGDOMS 
Off the western coast of Faen1n are a number of island 
realms of varying size. The most distant, and yet per-
haps the most symbolically important to the mainland, 
is Evermeet, the island paradise of the elves, reputed to 
be a part of the divine realm of Arvandor. Much closer 
to Faen1n are the Whalebones and Ruathym, ancient 
homes of the ancestors of the Illuskan people, and the 
Moonshaes, where many of those same people now 
share the islands with the Ffolk and an elf offshoot 
known as the Llewyr. The free port of Mintarn lies 
nearby, a neutral site for meetings between enemies 
and a recruitment spot that offers abundant jobs for 
sailors. Despite its size, the tiny island of Orlumbor, 
with its treacherous harbor and its skilled, in-demand 
shipwrights, is an independent and influential nation 
unto itself. 
In the seas to the south, pirates of many races and pre-
dilections sail from the Nelanther Isles, preying on trade 
running north and south along the coasts. Since the 
beginning of the Sundering, fabled Lantan and Nimbral 
have returned. Both the center of invention and the isle 
of Leira-worshiping illusionists are even more secretive 
and less welcoming of strangers than before their dis-
appearance. 
INDEPENDENT REALMS 
Interspersed among the fortresses of the dwarves and 
the settlements protected by the Lord's Alliance are 
significant sites that have no collective character, except 
that they exist largely outside the protection or purview 
of the great powers of the region. Even the civilized 
locales among these places, such as Elturgard, exist, 
at best, in an uneasy tension with the denizens of the 
wilder lands within and just outside their borders, and 
survive only through constant vigilance and the steady 
recruitment of new defenders. 
A great variety of independent nations and notable 
locations is encompassed within the wild lands of the 
North. Among them are the great library of Candlekeep, 
home of the greatest collection of written lore in FaerO.n; 
the imposing, giant-scale castle of Darkhold; the forti-
fied abbey of Helm's Hold; sites of great battles such as 
Boareskyr Bridge and the Fields of the Dead; realms of 
some security, such as Elturgard and Hartsvale; and the 
yuan-ti realm of Najara. The lands of the Uthgardt, the 
towns of frigid Icewind Dale, the quiet Trielta Hills, the 
cutthroat city of Luskan, and the legendary Warlock's 
Crypt, dominion of the great lich Larloch, are all inde-
pendent realms, as are the High Moor, the Trollclaws, 
and the High Forest.
