way into, among dwarves and between dwarves and 
non-dwarves. 
To other dwarves, Mierren are translators and local 
guides and "the people who know the right people" in 
human-dominated cities everywhere along the Sword 
Coast and in much of the Heartlands. Most adult Mier-
ren have dealings with a variety of human costers and 
merchants, taking care to avoid exclusivity or cultivate 
too narrow a range of business partners and contacts, 
so they control their own destinies and fortunes. They 
abhor the thought of humans having the slightest 
chance of dominating them. 
The wealth that flows through Mirabar has not only 
extended the reach and worldly knowledge of all Mier-
ren, it has enabled them to indulge all sorts of personal 
hobbies, such as art collections (statuettes and paintings 
in particular). The private living quarters of most Mier-
ren feature comfortable furniture, painted artwork large 
and small, statuary, and hanging chimes- often metal-
lic, but always soft and pleasant, never loud or strident. 
Gems are plentiful in Mierren families and are used 
as currency and in all manner of personal adornment, 
rather than being hidden away. Semiprecious stones 
line many of the streets in Mirabar, and gorgeous inlays 
mark important corners and intersections, some so new 
that one can still smell the jeweler's dust. 
Still, despite the city's overall wealth, there are rich 
and (relatively) poor Mirabarrans. Not everyone shares 
in the coin the city's sales bring in, and wage work-
ers whose income is determined by a day's labor or a 
month's output can't hope to expect that a well-worded 
contract by an employer will enrich them in the least. 
Wealthy merchants and business owners are careful 
not to show their success ostentatiously; their clothing 
might be of richer fabrics, but still in the same styles 
and colors as the garb of poorer folks. Waiting rooms 
and front halls in the fortified homes of the rich are just 
as sparsely furnished as those in poorer homes. Keep-
ing up the appearance of relative equality in fortunes 
is vital, for if anyone in a position to commit a violent 
act- say, a weaponsmith with access to great stores of 
swords and axes- knew just how wealthy the wealthiest 
Mirabarrans were, there would very likely be bloodshed 
before the offended parties were satisfied. 
NEVERWINTER 
A short while ago, Neverwinter was beset by all manner 
of damage, danger, and gloom. Now, the ores that once 
menaced the city have moved east to join their breth-
ren in being crushed by the dwarves. The Chasm that 
rent the land has been sealed by powerful magic. The 
High Road has been cleared and rebuilt, and trade has 
resumed with Waterdeep and realms to the south. What 
was the blasted, wounded city of Neverwinter just a 
decade ago is now an exciting, humming place, where 
folk seem eager to throw off the hardships from which 
they have emergeq and create a new, brighter future for 
their city. 
Nearly half a century ago, Mount Hotenow (the nearby 
volcano that perpetually heats the river flowing through 
the city) violently erupted, destroying much of Neverwin-
ter, killing thousands, and leaving in its wake a great, 
gaping chasm that split the city. Neverwinter was in 
ruins, and external influences- from Netheril to Thay 
to Lord Dagult Neverember ofWaterdeep to the agents 
of the Hells themselves- sought to exert control over 
the city. Many folk fought to stem all these dangers, and 
eventually, a measure of peace fell over Neverwinter. 
Since Dagult Neverember was deposed as the Open 
Lord of Waterdeep, he has thrown his full attention 
and effort into the rebuilding of the city from which he 
claims descent. Whatever people's opinions are of his 
claim to Neverwinter's throne, he has proven a capa-
ble, inspiring leader over these last few years, and the 
population has embraced him as Lord Protector. He 
engineered the sealing of the Chasm and the restoration 
of the High Road, and is seeking other ways to repair 
and improve the city. Even if he can never prove his 
descent from Lord Nasher Alagondar, the people of 
Neverwinter have accepted his leadership. (My rumored 
personal dislike of Lord Neverember has nothing to do 
with my assessment of his leadership; I merely find him 
an intolerable flirt.) 
Neverember's influence radiates outward from the 
Protector's Enclave, centered at the Hall of Justice. With 
Tyr restored to life and his worship returning to prom-
inence, the Lord Protector has moved into a modest, 
private villa. This sacrifice- and the renewal of Tyr's 
faith in the previous center of his operations- is only 
further proof, to some, that Neverember deserves to rule 
Neverwinter. As yet, Castle Never remains a dangerous 
ruin, but Neverember has plans to reclaim and rebuild it 
as a symbol of the city's rejuvenation. 
The faithful of Oghma have arrived in Neverwinter to 
restore the House of Knowledge to its former glory, but 
beyond that, shrines to all manner of gods have been 
cobbled together in every corner of the city. 
As the city restores itself, there are likely to be 
requests for ennoblement and the privileges that pro-
vides, and certainly, trading interests will emerge. But 
Lord Protector Neverember is sure to point out that he 
is merely a protector, not a king, and so can't invest or 
recognize anyone. Guilds may form, but it is sure to be 
years, if not decades, before any prove strong enough to 
persevere over their rivals. 
Increasingly, calls come from the citizenry for the 
enforcers out of Mintarn to be replaced by respectable, 
local guards who have a personal interest in the defense 
of Neverwinter. This public sentiment has led to some
