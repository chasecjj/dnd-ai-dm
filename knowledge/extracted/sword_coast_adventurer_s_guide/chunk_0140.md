APPENDIX: CLASS OPTIONS IN OTHER WORLDS 
HE CLASS OPTIONS IN THIS BOOK ARE 
designed for the Forgotten Realms, but 
they can be easily transported to other offi-
cial D&D worlds or to a world of your own 
creation. This appendix offers suggestions 
for modifying names and other elements of 
the character options in chapter 4. 
None of the statements here should be treated as 
canonical for the D&D settings discussed. Instead, 
take them in the spirit of advice given from one DM to 
another on how to integrate these new character options 
into your campaign. 
DRAGONLANCE 
Use the following guidelines to adapt this book's class 
options to a campaign set on Krynn. 
BARBARIAN 
Barbarians are most common among Kagonesti elves 
and human .nomad tribes. Both groups have a healthy 
respect for the land and its creatures, and the tiger and 
elk totems both have devotees among them. While the 
folk of Ansalon know of elk, the griffon replaces the ti-
ger as an object of respect. 
The battlerager has no equivalent in the Dragonlance 
saga. A character opting for the Path of the Battlerager 
might be part of a gnomish attempt at inventing a new 
sort of armor, an effort that yielded a dangerous but 
effective fighting style. It's up to the player whether the 
barbarian's rage stems from a set of tactics developed 
for use with the gnome-created spiked armor or from 
sheer frustration at having to turn to the mad tinker 
gnomes for help. 
CLERIC 
The Arcana Domain has no established place in Drag-
on lance. The gods of magic are patrons of the Wizards 
of High Sorcery. Spellcasters revere the deity appro-
priate to their order through the study and mastery of 
arcane magic, rather than through divine power. How-
ever, clerics devoted to the neutral gods Gilean (god of 
knowledge) and Zivilyn (god of wisdom) might have the 
Arcana Domain. 
FIGHTER 
The Purple Dragon Knight is an ideal match for the 
Knights of Solamnia, specifically a Knight of the Rose. 
As leaders of their order, Knights of the Rose are ex-
pected to provide wisdom, inspiration, and guidance to 
the knights in all situations. 
MONK 
Few monks are found on Krynn, but those active in the 
world fall into two camps. 
The Way of the Long Death provides a good match 
for those evil monks who worship Sargonnas. The mi-
notaurs who follow Sargas sometimes follow this path, 
but most prefer the martial aspect of the Way of the 
Open Hand. 
The Way of the Sun Soul could be used to represent 
followers of Sirrion, god of creativity, passion, fighters, 
and fire. Sirrion is said to sculpt the fire of the soul, and 
these monks seek to sculpt their minds and bodies so 
that all three act in unison, making instinct and action 
one and the same. 
PALADIN 
The Oath of the Crown is a perfect match for any pal-
adin who is a member of the Knights of the Sword or 
Knights of the Skull. Both orders swear fealty to an or-
ganization and combine spellcasting and martial skill. 
ROGUE 
The Mastermind matches well with any character of 
cunning, intelligence, and insight who might be involved 
in court intrigue. But it also serves as a good way to por-
tray a cunning pirate captain from the Blood Sea Isles. 
The Swashbuckler provides another option for char-
acters who hail from that region. Serving as pirates 
or mariners plying the Blood Sea, a Swashbuckler's 
emphasis on speed and light armor is ideal for an 
environment where heavy armor is little more than a 
deadly anchor. 
WARLOCK 
The warlock character class has yet to be depicted in 
the Dragonlance setting. That said, warlocks of various 
types might be individuals who make promises to the 
gods in return for power, and the Undying patron is a 
good match for a character who seeks to follow in the 
footsteps of a long dead but mighty wizard. 
WIZARD 
Bladesinging is a good option for elf warriors of the 
Qualinesti or Silvanesti. Like the heroic Gilthanas, a 
bladesinger combines a study of arcane magic with a 
mastery of the blade. 
EBERRON 
Use the following guidelines to adapt this book's class 
options to a campaign set on Eberron. 
BARBARIAN 
The Path of the Battlerager is a great fit for a warforged 
barbarian trained for close quarters battle and with 
a chassis modified to incorporate spikes, blades, and 
other weapons. These warforged made ideal shock 
troops during the Last War. The few that survive have 
little choice but to continue martial pursuits, as their 
frames are suited for little else. 
The new totem warrior options are an obvious choice 
for barbarians with an affinity for a tiger or an elk. The 
option can also reflect an Argonnessen barbarian's ties
