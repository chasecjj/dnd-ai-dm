Although there are many halfling communities, par-
ticularly in the lands in and around Luiren, halflings fre-
quently fit themselves into dwarven, gnomish, elven, and 
human societies. Lightfoots breeze into communities 
as they travel, make friends easily, and then move on 
as the wind or whimsy takes them. Stronghearts settle 
in, make themselves at home, and weave themselves 
so deftly into the fabric of a community that it becomes 
hard for folk to think of a time without them. 
LIGHTFOOT·HALFLINGS 
For lightfoot halflings, neither the journey nor the des-
tination matters more; the important thing is to keep 
moving. The life of a lightfoot is one long exploration 
with each new horizon, new town, or new face a chance 
to find something delightful. 
Lightfoot halflings typically travel in small bands, us-
ing whatever conveyance is convenient but just as easily 
striking out on foot. Bands consist of loosely related in-
dividuals, and when bands meet, membership frequently 
shifts. Lightfoot halflings typically excel at tasks related 
to travel- be it navigation, handling pack animals, for-
aging, sailing, and cartwright work- having tried their 
hand at all such things before or learned from other 
lightfoots met during their journeys. 
Lightfoot halflings are highly social, often as curious 
about other people as they are about what might lie 
around the next bend. They characteristically possess 
an easygoing and open attitude, curious about others 
and willing to share of themselves, which enables them 
to make friends easily. Their facile friendships and ease 
with partings can make lightfoot halflings seem disin-
genuous to others. Lightfoot halflings get stereotyped as 
flighty, easily distracted, fickle, and unreliable. But their 
friendships and courtships, if brief, tend to be genuine. 
The staid and stable life that most other people desire 
just isn't part of their character. 
Lightfoot halflings have all the racial traits of lightfoot 
halflings in the Player's Handbook. They share the skin, 
hair, and eye tones of humans, but most lightfoot hal-
flings have hazel or brown eyes and brown hair. Light-
foot halflings don't grow facial hair except that males 
and females typically grow short sideburns. 
STRONGHEART HALFLINGS 
--------
Creatures of the earth who love a warm hearth and 
pleasant company, strongheart halflings are folks of few 
enemies and many friends. Stronghearts are sometimes 
referred to fondly by members of other races as "the 
good folk," for little upsets stronghearts or corrupts 
their spirit. To many of them, the greatest fear is to live 
in a world of poor company and mean intent, where one 
lacks freedom and the comfort of friendship. 
When strongheart halflings settle into a place, they 
intend to stay. It's not unusual for a dynasty of strong-
hearts to live in the same place for a few centuries. 
Strongheart halflings don't develop these homes in 
seclusion. On the contrary, they do their best to fit into 
the local community and become an essential part of 
it. Their viewpoint stresses cooperation above all other 
traits, and the ability to work well with others is the 
most valued behavior in their lands. 
Pushed from their nests, strongheart haflings typi-
cally try to have as many comforts of home with them as 
possible. Non-stronghearts with a more practical bent 
can find strongheart travel habits maddening, but their 
lightfoot cousins typically enjoy the novelty of it- so long 
as the lightfoots don't have to carry any of the baggage. 
While often stereotyped as fat and lazy due to their 
homebound mindset and obsession with fine food, 
strongheart halfings are typically quite industrious. 
Nimble hands, their patient mindset, and their emphasis 
on quality makes them excellent weavers, potters, wood 
carvers, basket makers, painters, and farmers. 
Strongheart halflings have all the racial traits of 
stouts in the Player's Handbook. Strongheart halflings 
are shorter on average than their lightfoot kin, and tend 
to have rounder faces. They have the skin tones and hair 
colors of humans, with most having brown hair. Unlike 
their lightfoot cousins, strongheart halflings often have 
blond or black hair and blue or green eyes. Males don't 
grow beards or mustaches, but both males and females 
can grow sideburns down to mid-cheek, and both gen-
ders plait them into long braids. 
HALFLING DEITIES 
The hin have a small but intimate pantheon of deities, 
which are honored primarily at household altars, road-
side shrines, and wooded groves. 
THE BLESSED SISTERS 
The hin mother-goddess and the head of the pantheon 
is Yondalla, the Blessed One, goddess of bounty and 
fertility, protector of hearth, home, and family. Sheela 
Peryroyl is the Green Sister of Yondalla. She is a nature 
goddess, the lady of fields, streams, and the wilds found 
in shire and glen, and the weather in such places. She is 
also a goddess of love, song, and dance.
