BARBARIAN TRIBES OF FAERUN 
Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either 
it or the outlander background from the Player's Handbook 
can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of 
the other barbarian tribes in Faerun. 
You might be a fair-haired barbarian of the Reghed, 
dwelling in the shadow of the Reghed Glacier in the far 
North near lcewind Dale. You might also be of the no-
madic Rashemi, noted for their savage berserkers and their 
masked witches. Perhaps you hail from one of the wood 
elf tribes in the Chondalwood, or the magic-hating human 
tribes of the sweltering jungles of Chu It. 
You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had 
decided to settle down, and now that they have aban-
doned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might 
come from a segment of the Uthgardt that adheres to 
tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by 
achieving great things as a formidable adventurer. 
See the "Uthgardt Lands" section of chapter 2 for de-
tails on each tribe's territory and its activities that will 
help you choose your affiliation. 
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival 
Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument or 
artisan's tools 
Languages: One of your choice 
Equipment: A hunting trap, a totemic token or set 
of tattoos marking your loyalty to Uthgar and your 
tribal totem, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch 
containing 10 gp 
FEATURE: UTHGARDT HERITAGE 
You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's 
territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of 
the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any 
wilderness area that you find twice as much food and 
water as you normally would when you forage there. 
Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of 
your people, and those folk allied with your tribe, often 
including members of druid circles, tribes of nomadic 
elves, the Harpers, and the priesthoods devoted to the 
gods of the First Circle. 
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 
Use the tables for the outlander background in the 
Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and moti-
vations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit 
your identity as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. 
Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for 
now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will 
never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not coun-
tenance such an act being done in your presence. The 
Uthgardt ancestral mounds- great hills where the totem 
spirits were defeated by Uthgar and where the heroes of 
the tribes are interred- are sacred to you. 
Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe 
or some aspect of Uthgardt philosophy or culture (per-
haps even Uthgar himself). Your ideal is a personal 
choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your 
people and certainly doesn't contradict or compromise 
what being an Uthgardt stands for. 
C HAPTER 5 I BACKGROUNDS 
WATERDHAVIAN NOBLE 
You are a scion of one of the great noble families of Wa-
terdeep. Human families who jealously guard their priv-
ilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian 
nobles have a reputation across FaerO.n for being eccen-
tric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich. 
Whether you are a shining example of the reason 
for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being 
an exception, people expect things of you when they 
know your surname and what it means. Your reasons 
for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in 
some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delv-
ing in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have 
you taken up sword or spell on your family's behalf, 
ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to 
their legacy? 
Work with your DM to come up with the family you 
are part of - there are around seventy-five lineages in 
Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, spe-
cialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line 
of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one 
day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with 
less prestige but also less responsibility. 
Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion 
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or one 
musical instrument 
Languages: One of your choice 
Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring or 
brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine zzar or 
wine, and a purse containing 20 gp 
FEATURE: KEPT IN STYLE 
While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North 
your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name a~d 
signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the 
inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to re-
cord your debt and send an accounting to your family's 
estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe. 
This advantage enables you to live a comfortable life-
style without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces 
the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that 
amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle 
and use the difference as income-the benefit is a line of 
credit, not an actual monetary reward. 
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 
Use the tables for the noble background in the Player's 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a member of a Waterdhavian family. 
Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a dif-
ferent world from the one that most folk know- one that 
grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty be-
fitting your station. Your bond might be associated with 
your family alone, or it could be concerned with another 
noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your 
ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role 
in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in 
the world at large as a representative of your house.
