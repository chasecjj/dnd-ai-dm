LLIIRA 
Our Lady of joy, joybringer, the Mistress of Revels 
Lliira is a beloved goddess, a deity of contentment, re-
lease, joy, happiness, dance, and freedom. As the patron 
of festivals, she is honored at any celebration, and dance 
is the primary way to worship her. The Mistress of Rev-
els is said to abhor violence, and any fighting or drawing 
of weapons (except in ceremony) at a celebration will 
cause her to withhold her favor. Her priests and priest-
esses, known as joybringers, take it as their mission to 
make other people happy, even if just for a moment. 
Her faithful always wear at least one clothing item of 
a bright, cheerful color, and her priests' vestments have 
more in common with festival attire than with somber 
ecclesial garments. Rubies and sapphires are sacred to 
Our Lady of Joy, and her priests bless anyone they see 
wearing such adornments. 
Lliira's followers aren't frivolous, however. To them, 
divine joy is a very real gift to the world of mortals, and 
one much needed. To that end, they fight those who 
would bring misery to others. They are fierce against 
their foes, and joyous revelers when their work is done. 
LOVIATAR 
The Maiden of Pain, the Scourge Mistress, the Willing Whip 
Pain isn't a means to an end for Loviatar's faithful, but 
an end unto itself. To them, nothing is as transcendent 
as suffering, and all pain is holy, from the crudest bar-
barism, to the most sublime torture, to the emotional 
suffering of the heartbroken or the betrayed. 
The pain that one feels is proof of the Lady's attention, 
and so her faithful are notorious self-flagellants. Pain 
is also a path to power, in terms of both one's ability to 
inflict it and one's ability to endure it. A cold, cruel de-
meanor is considered ideal because it best emulates the 
Scourge Mistress, and for the same reason her faithful 
appreciate beauty, cultural refinement, and a certain 
adeptness at manipulation. 
Though temples to Loviatar are rare, her faithful are 
more numerous than might be expected. Loviatar is 
the chosen deity of those who inflict pain as a matter 
of course, including torturers and others who need to 
break the will of their victims. She is favored by sadists 
and masochists, and some of her followers form cultish 
cells of secret adherents. Each of these groups is led by 
someone who takes pleasure in administering pain and 
SYMBOL OF LLllRh 
dominating others, supported and backed up by a num-
ber of submissive sycophants. 
Worshipers of Loviatar rarely gather in numbers ex-
cept in the more populous cities. When small cadres of 
faithful operate quietly in such places, few citizens take 
notice or raise a fuss if they do witness cult activity. The 
sufferers who endure the lash, however, aren't always 
willing participants, and Lovatar's cults sometimes op-
erate secret slavery rings, which can draw the attention 
of the authorities. The open worship of Loviatar and 
temples clearly dedicated to her are rarely seen except 
in lands where slavery is an accepted practice. 
MALAR 
The Beastlord, the Black-Blooded One 
Malar epitomizes the dark side of nature, the world that 
is red in tooth and claw. His faithful believe the hunt is 
the center point between life and death- the facing off 
of hunter and prey, forcing the issue of who lives and 
who dies. People believe that Malar can't be propitiated 
and knows no mercy, so he receives prayers only from 
those engaging in a hunt. Such supplicants pray to Ma-
lar for two reasons: to beg the aid of his peerless skill 
as a hunter, or to adopt his fearsome mantle and thus 
ward off other predators. Malar is the god of those who 
delight in the hunt, don't shy from bloodshed, and savor 
the fear of their prey. 
Many lycanthropes consider Malar to be their divine 
father, as do some other intelligent predators. He has 
many devotees who are druids and rangers of partic-
ularly savage inclination, and many barbarians take 
Malar as a patron for his ferocity and cruelty. His priests 
use claw bracers, impressive gauntlets bedecked with 
stylized claws that jut out from the ends of the fists, as 
ceremonial weapons. 
MASK 
The Lord of Shadows, the Master of All Thieves 
Mask is a trickster god, the patron of ne'er-do-wells, 
spies, and thieves. All that occurs within shadow is in 
the purview of Mask. People whisper a prayer to Mask 
whenever stealth is required or intrigue is afoot. Court-
iers and diplomats invoke the god's name in hopes of a 
smooth negotiation. 
Those who favor Mask usually pursue thievery and 
other forms of acquisition of what belongs to others, 
such as pickpocketing, burglary, mugging, and con
