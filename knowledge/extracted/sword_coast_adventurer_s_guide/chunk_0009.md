Alamber Sea and Ash Lake. The dragonborn that have 
withdrawn to those areas have lost none of their military 
tradition, and their ability to hold this smaller amount of 
territory makes it unlikely that Unther will push farther 
any time soon- particularly since the Untherite navy 
has been unable to overcome the great beast that guards 
the harbor of Djerad Kethendi and the nearby waters of 
the Alamber. 
Some of Tymanther's dragonborn have spread across 
FaerGn and gained reputations as competent, highly 
sought-after mercenaries. 
Unther. Trapped in another world, the people of 
Unther had succumbed to domination by others. Then 
among them arose one who called himself Gilgeam, and 
he reminded them of their former greatness. Under the 
leadership of this reincarnated god, the people of Unther 
rose up as an army to face their masters. On the eve of 
a great battle, the people of Unther were miraculously 
returned to their home, and Gilgeam wasted no time in 
leading them against the dragonborn occupying their 
ancestral la nds. The Unthcritcs have re lake u rnucl1 uf 
the land they formerly held, while seeking to wipe out 
the "godless lizards" they blame for their time of oppres-
sion in Abeir. 
Gilgeam wants nothing short of a complete return to 
Unther's former glory. This achievement will require ut-
terly destroying Tymanther, of course, and eventual war 
with Mulhorand to reclaim lands lost centuries ago, but 
as every Untherite knows, the great God-King is patient, 
for he is eternal. 
Westgate. The dismal city of Westgate isn't a romantic 
place, but someone seeking employment for shady work, 
or looking to hire someone for the same, will find few 
places better suited in all of FaerGn. 
Westgate is considered by some FaerGnians as a har-
binger of the eventual fate of places like Arnn and Sem-
bia, where coin rules over all other considerations. As in 
many such places, one's moral outlook is less important 
in Westgate than one's attitude toward bribery. The 
city's proximity to Cormyr makes it a breeding ground 
for that nation's enemies, including the Fire Knives, a 
guild of thieves and assassins that the naive pretend 
doesn't exist. 
KARA-TUR 
Far to the east, past the wastes of the Hordelands, lie 
the empires of Shou Lung, Kozakura, Wa, and the other 
lands of the vast continent of Kara-Tur. To most people 
of FaerGn, Kara-Tur is like another world, and the tales 
told by travelers from its nations seem to confirm it. 
The gods that humans worship in FaerGn are unknown 
there, as are common peoples such as gnomes and ores. 
Other dragons, neither chromatic nor metallic, dwell in 
its lands and fly its skies. And its mages practice forms 
of magic mysterious even to archwizards of FaerGn. 
Stories of Kara-Tur tell of gold and jade in great 
abundance, rich spices, silks, and other goods rare 
or unknown in western lands- alongside tales of 
shapechanging spirit-people, horned giants, and night-
mare monsters absent in FaerGn. 
C HAPTER I I WELCOME TO THE REALMS 
ZAKHARA 
Far to the south of FaerGn, beyond Calimshan and even 
the jungles of Ch ult, are the Lands of Fate. Surrounded 
by waters thick with pirates and corsairs, Zakhara is 
a place less hospitable than most, but still braved by 
travelers who hope to profit from its exotic goods and 
strange magics. Like Kara-Tur, Zakhara seems a world 
away to FaerGnians. It is thought of as a vast desert, 
sprinkled with glittering cities like scattered gems. Ro-
mantic tales abound of scimitar-wielding rogues riding 
flying carpets and of genies bound in service to humans. 
Their mages, called sha'ir, practice their magic with the 
aid of genies and, it is said, might carry the lineage of 
these elemental beings in their blood. 
BEYOND THE TRACKLESS SEA 
Farther to the west, past even Evermeet, are untold, un-
known lands beyond the Trackless Sea. Many explorers 
have visited such lands, and some have even returned, 
bearing rales that change from generation to generation 
about exotic locales, from island chains that are the 
sites of countless shipwrecks, to fearsome feather-clad 
warriors, and vast continents that suddenly appeared 
where nothing- or something very much different- had 
rested only seasons prior. 
TIME IN THE REALMS 
Although a number of means exist for marking the days 
and the passage of time during a year, nearly all folk in 
FaerGn have adopted the Calendar of Harptos. Even the 
cultures and races that don't favor this method of mark-
ing time are aware of it, with the result that it is recog-
nized across nearly all races, languages, and cultures. 
A year on Tori! consists of 365 days. In the Calen-
dar of Harptos, the year is divided into twelve months 
of thirty days, loosely following the synodic cycle of 
SelGne, the moon. A month is made up of three ten-
days, also known as rides. Five annual holidays, falling 
between the months, complete the 365-day calendar. 
Once every four years, the Calendar of Harptos includes 
Shieldmeet as a "leap day" following Midsummer. 
Individual days of a tenday have no special names. In-
stead, they are denoted by counting from the beginning 
of the period ("first day," "second day," and so on). Days 
of the month are designated by a number and the month 
name. For example, sages would record an event as oc-
curring on "1 Mirtul" or "27 Uktar." People might also 
refer to a given day by its relationship to the current date 
("two tendays from today") or the nearest holiday ("three 
days past Greengrass"). 
SPECIAL CALENDAR DAYS 
Every nation, faith, and culture across FaerGn has its 
own special festivals and holidays, the observances of 
which are governed by the cycles of the sun, the moon, 
the stars, or some other event. In addition, the Calendar 
of Harptos specifies five annual festivals keyed to the 
changing of the seasons and one quadrennial festival 
that are observed in almost every land, with particular
