Merchants and guilds hire guards to protect caravans, 
ships, and their warehouses and guildhalls. Such work 
affords the opportunity for frequent travel and danger. 
A good deal of danger comes from fighters who aban-
don legitimate employment to become bandits- raiding 
caravans, robbing travelers, and pillaging isolated home-
steads, manors, and villages. Out-of-luck fighters might 
also take part in gladiatorial fights or similar blood 
sports to make a living off their skills, although such 
matches are virtually unknown on the Sword Coast and 
in the North, as compared to southern nations like Arnn 
and Calimshan. 
MARTIAL ARCHETYPE 
Fighters in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Martial Archetype option, in addition to those in the 
Player's Handbook. 
PURPLE DRAGON KNIGHT 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Purple Dragon knights are warriors who hail from 
the kingdom of Cormyr. Pledged to protect the crown, 
they take the fight against evil beyond their kingdom's 
CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 
borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as 
knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and 
fidelity to the code of chivalry to guide them in defeating 
evildoers. 
A Purple Dragon knight inspires greatness in others 
by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere pres-
ence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some 
ores and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a 
skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can 
transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a 
ferocious war band. 
A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As 
a knight spearheads an attack, the knight's actions can 
awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that 
they never suspected they had. 
RESTRICTION: KNIGHTHOOD 
Purple Dragon knights are tied to a specific order of 
Cormyrean knighthood. 
Banneret serves as the generic name for this arche-
type if you use it in other campaign settings or to model 
warlords other than Purple Dragon knights. 
RALLYING CRY 
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn 
how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries. 
When you use your Second Wind feature, you can 
choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that 
are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal 
to your fighter level, provided that the creature can see 
or hear you. 
ROYAL ENVOY 
A Purple Dragon knight serves as an envoy of the 
Cormyrean crown. Knights of high standing are ex-
pected to conduct themselves with grace. 
At 7th level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion 
skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain profi-
ciency in one of the following skills of your choice: Ani-
mal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance. 
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability 
check you make that uses Persuasion. You receive this 
benefit regardless of the skill proficiency you gain from 
this feature. 
INSPIRING SURGE 
Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge 
feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of 
you that is allied with you. That creature can make one 
melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction, pro-
vided that it can see or hear you. 
Starting at 17th level, you can choose two allies within 
60 feet of you, rather than one. 
BULWARK 
Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of 
your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to 
use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or 
a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, 
you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also 
failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that 
creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving 
throw and must use the new roll.
