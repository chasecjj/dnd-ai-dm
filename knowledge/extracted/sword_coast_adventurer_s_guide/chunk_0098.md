GHOSTWISE HALFLINGS 
Ghostwise halflings trace their ancestry back to a war 
among halfling tribes that sent their ancestors into flight 
from Luiren. Ghostwise halflings are the rarest of the hin, 
found only in the Chondalwood and a few other isolated 
forests, clustered in tight-knit clans. 
Many ghostwise clans select a natural landmark as the 
center of their territory, and members carry a piece of that 
landmark with them at all times. Clan warriors known as 
nightgliders bond with and ride giant owls as mounts. 
Because these folk are clannish and mistrustful of out-
siders, ghostwise halfling adventurers are rare. Ask you r 
DM if you can play a member of this subrace, which has 
the halfling traits in the Player's Handbook, plus the sub-
race traits below.

Silent Speech. You can speak telepathically to any crea-
ture within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you 
only if the two of you share a language. You can speak tele-
pathically in this way to one creature at a time. 
KEEPERS OF THE HOME 
Cyrrollalee is goddess of the hearth and hospitality, as 
well as of trust and handicrafts. Arvoreen is a defend-
er-god, a watchful protector who sacrifices personal 
comfort for the safety of others. 
THE SHADOWED Goos 
Brandobaris is the trickster-god of thievery and stealth, 
patron of many halfting adventurers. Urogalan is the 
silent, melancholy god of the earth and death. Accompa-
nied everywhere by a great dark hound, he is saddened 
by his duties, and vigilant in ensuring that the dead are 
respected and protected. 
LADY LUCK 
Many halfiings have taken to regular worship of Tymora, 
seeing her as a helping hand in their fortunes and a pa-
tron of the luckiness associated with the hin. 
HUMANS 
Humans dwell in every corner of Tori! and encompass a 
full range of cultures and ethnicities. Along the Sword 
Coast and across the North, humans are the most perva-
sive of the races and in many places the most dominant. 
Their cultural and societal makeup runs the gamut, 
from the cosmopolitan folk who reside in great cities

such as Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep to the barbarians 
who rage throughout the Savage Frontier. 
Humans are famous for their adaptability. No other 
race lives in so many diverse lands or environments, 
from lush jungles to burning deserts, from the eternal 
cold of the Great Glacier to the fertile shores along 
rivers and seas. Humans find ways to survive and 
to thrive almost anywhere. In locations where elves 
and dwarves have withdrawn, humans often move 
in and build anew alongside or on top of an earlier 
community. 
It follows, then, that the most common feature of hu-
mans is their lack of commonality. This diversity has 
enabled human civilizations to grow faster than those of 
other races, making humans one of the dominant races 
in much of the world today. It has also led to conflicts be-
tween communities of humans because of their cultural 
and political differences. If not for their penchant for 
infighting, humans would be even more populous and 
predominant than they already are. 
HUMAN ETHNICITIES IN FAERUN 
Nine human ethnicities in Faerfln are detailed in the 
Player's Handbook. Several other noteworthy groups 
of humans are discussed here. Some are significant 
minorities in regions or nations that border the North, 
while others are prevalent in parts of the world far from 
the Sword Coast. 
ARKAIUN 
Short in stature with tan skin and dark hair, the Arkai-
uns dwell primarily in Dambrath as well as Halruaa and 
the Shar. Many Arkaiuns lived under the yoke of drow 
slavery centuries ago after a failed military campaign 
against the dark elves, which led to the eventual destruc-
tion of the Arkaiun kingdom in Dambra th. 
Arkaiun Names: (Male) Houn, Rhivaun, Umbril, 
Xaemar, Zeltaebar; (female) Glouris, Maeve, 
Sevaera, Xaemarra, Zraela; (surnames) Lharaendo, 
Mristar, Wyndael 
BE DINE 
Dark-skinned and dark-haired, the Bedine were war-
riors and nomads in southern Anauroch. Once divided 
into over a hundred tribes, the clannish Bedine mostly 
kept to their desert lands and interacted little with 
outsiders, except for trading. Over the generations, more
