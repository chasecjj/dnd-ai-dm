Tempus teach that war conducted properly is fair in 
that it oppresses all sides equally, and that in any given 
battle,a mortal might be slain or might become a great 
leader among his or her companions. Mortals shouldn't 
fear war but should see it as a natural force, the storm 
that civilization brings about by its very existence. 
TORM 
The Loyal Fury, the True, the Hand of Righteousness 
Torm is the god of duty and loyalty, revered by those 
who face danger to bring about a greater good. Those 
who favor Torm believe that one's salvation can be found 
through service, that every failure to perform one's 
duty diminishes Torm, and that every success adds to 
his luster. Those who take Torm to heart must strive to 
fulfill his commandment to go out into the world and 
be an active force for good, to right wrongs, and to help 
the hopeless. They must strive to maintain peace and 
order while opposing unjust laws. Followers of Torm 
stand ever alert against corruption and are expected to 
strike quickly and hard against any evidence of rot in the 
hearts of mortals. As the sword arm of justice, Torm's 
faithful are expected to bring quick deaths to betrayers. 
Considering these tenets, it should be no surprise that 
most human paladins have Torm as their patron. 
Most temples dedicated to Torm are fortresses built 
on heights. These structures offer austere quarters for 
residents and visiting knights, drilling grounds, and 
stables. White granite, lion statues, and armored figures 
predominate in the architecture, with the coats of arms 
of fallen heroes decorating the walls of the great halls. 
Torm is seen as the good right hand of Tyr, and a such 
his symbol is a white gauntlet made for the right hand. 
It represents Tyr's sword hand, but it is also a symbol of 
forbearance. Torm is frequently depicted with his right 
gauntlet extended palm forward, which worshipers call 
the Hand Resolute. It signifies the principle that the 
just and true must pause before acting to judge whether 
their intentions uphold Torm's ideals. Temples, civic 
structures, and the homes of the faithful are often dec-
orated with images of the Hand Resolute as a constant 
reminder of this principle. 
Worshipers of Torm come from most walks of life, for 
he welcomes any who seek the best in themselves and 
others, who uphold his tenets of loyalty, responsibility, 
duty, and kindness, or who are willing to sacrifice to 
keep evil from gaining ascendancy in the world. The 
faithful know that all of them will stumble from time

to time while following in Torm's footsteps, but Torm's 
priests teach that the shame of a minor fall from grace 
is far less severe than declining to rise oneself up to 
Torm's standards. 
TYMORA 
Lady Luck, Our Smiling Lady 
Tymora is the bright-faced goddess of fortune, the one 
to whom gamblers and game-players pray in Faerun. 
Our Smiling Lady is said to love none so much as those 
who gamble with the utmost skill and daring. Yet she 
is thought to watch over all who take risks to better 
their fortunes. 
The battle cry of the followers of Tymora is "Fortune 
favors the bold." Someone might say words to Tymora 
before any endeavor in which a little good luck would 
help, but not when an incidence of bad luck might occur. 
(On such occasions folk pray to Beshaba to spare them 
from bad luck; praying to both is thought to anger both 
goddesses.) One common method of divining the future 
is to toss a coin to a stranger (typically a beggar) and ask 
if it's heads. If it is, the coin is left with the stranger as 
payment for Tymora's favor. If it's not, the stranger can 
choose to keep it (and the bad luck) or return it. 
Those who favor Tymora- as distinct from folk who 
invoke her name by mumbling over the dice-tend to be 
daring sorts. Adventurers and gamblers make up much 
of their ranks. They all have the belief that what is good 
about their lives is the result of having both good luck 
and the bravery to seek it out. Tymora has worshipers 
among all sorts of folk: the dashing young noble, the 
risk-taking merchant, the daydreaming field hand, and 
the scheming ne'er-do-well. 
Priests of Tymora and temples devoted to Lady Luck 
are scarce, since her faith tends not to stress a need 
for intermediaries: "Let the lucky man and the Smiling 
Lady suss it out," as the old saying goes. Shrines to 
Tymora at gambling parlors aren't unusual, however, 
and sometimes such establishments attract a priest and 
effectively become temples.
