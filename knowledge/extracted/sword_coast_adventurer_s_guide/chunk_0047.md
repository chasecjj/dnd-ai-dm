instruction to prove to a teacher that the knowledge 
imparted is being entrusted to a deserving person. 
In the east. of the city is the High Palace, capital of the 
city and of the fallen state of Luruar. Lord Methrammar 
Aerasume lives in this high, slender-spired structure. 
The merlons of its battlements are carved to resem-
ble unicorn heads. The soldiers of the High Guard, 
clad in shining silver plate, protect the residence and 
seat of power, and keep those out that don't have busi-
ness within. 
Silverymoon has long been led by a high mage. One of 
the longest ruling, and certainly the most influential of 
these, Alustriel Silverhand, stepped down more than a 
hundred years ago to become the High Lady of Luruar, 
and was succeeded by Taern Hornblade. Though 
he ruled wisely over the last century, Taern recently 
relinquished the city's leadership to High Marshal 
Methrammar Aerasume, Alustriel's half-elf son and the 
leader of Silverymoon's armed forces. Taern still speaks 
for the city on Methrammar's behalf at meetings of the 
Lords' Alliance, as the new ruler is far too blunt and 
impatient to suit the other lords of the compact. 
Silverymoon is defended by several forces. First are 
the Knights in Silver, the shining-armored warriors 
that patrol the city and the nearby lands. Officers of the 
Knights are well trained in tactics and military history, 
and have high opinions of their own abilities and those 
of their comrades-opinions that are very often borne 
out. They are bolstered by the Spellguard, a cadre of 
powerful wizards and sorcerers that train in battle 
magic. Last is the city's own mythal, the great field of 
magical force that prevents the inhabitants of the city 
from engaging in all manner of spellcasting. In partic-
ular, spells that summon flame, conjure creatures, or 
permit teleportation fail when their target is within the 
bounds of the mythal. Should a foe try to traverse the 
Moonbridge, the span can be willed (by the city's rulers, 
and certain others specially attuned to the mythal) out 
of existence, dropping attackers into the river. 
No city's prestige was harmed more than Sil-
verymoon's by the recent war and the subsequent 
dismantling of the Silver Marches. Though they tried to 
bolster the nearby cities, the Silvaeren were accused of 
providing insufficient and incompetent support to Sund-
abar, the surface population of which was entirely wiped 
out. In the end, all of the dwarven states stepped away 
from Luruar, and without the support of those kingdoms 
or the leadership that Alustriel provided at its founding, 
the confederacy collapsed. Taern Hornblade isn't as 
powerful a voice in the Lords' Alliance as Alustriel was, 
either, in part because his affection and respect for the 
former High Lady has been extended, in large part, to 
her sister Laeral, now the Open Lord ofWaterdeep. 
Despite reports of her death decades ago, rumors 
have recently reached the city that High Lady Alustriel is 
in fact alive and active in southern lands. Seemingly, she 
has contacted neither her son nor her former comrade, 
Taern Hornblade- though given how widely known 
Taern's hopeless love for the High Lady was, and the 
long years he took to overcome his grief, it's not certain 
how he would react upon receiving proof of her survival. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
Silverymoon has nonetheless long been known as a 
safe haven for Harpers in the North, because the city 
doesn't see the aims of the Alliance as conflicting with 
Those Who Harp. Where other cities' rulers might see 
the presence of the Harpers as a threat to their author-
ity, Silverymoon desires an end to tyranny as fervently 
as the Harpers do, and thus the greater good is served. 
At the same time, some Silvaeren believe that the city's 
tolerance of certain other members of the Alliance 
(some mention Mirabar, others Baldur's Gate) is some-
what naive. 
THE WARDS OF WATERDEEP 
Waterdeep has long been divided into several large regions 
called wards. To locals these are essential to Waterdeep, 
but outsiders often lose track of wh ich ward they're in or 
what a ward's name signifies. The names of the wards sug-
gest the contents of the buildings and the character of the 
activity in each one, but no laws exist that restrict a given 
activity or class of people to any specific ward. 
Castle Ward. As the name indicates, Castle Ward con-
tains Castle Waterdeep, Piergeiron 's Palace, and many 
other public buildings of the city. This ward is home to 
mainly the wealthy or influential who can't count them-
selves among the nobility. Other structures are taken up by 
educational or religious concerns that primarily serve the 
city at large, not the residents of the ward. 
Dock Ward. Most of the city's harbor area is located in 
Dock Ward, as are the businesses and warehouses that 
depend on the city's newly restored harbor. It's a crowded 
neighborhood of many winding streets, where folk are 
comfortable making deals that might in other places pro-
voke the displeasure of the law. 
Field Ward. Of relatively recent vintage, the Field Ward 
stands between the inner and outer north wa lls of the city 
(an area formerly used as a caravan grounds) . This ward 
grew up in a messy, unregulated fashion and is home to 
many of the poorest residents of the city. 
North Ward. Home to many noble villas, townhouses, 
and a great many inns, North Ward is the neighborhood of 
the respectably wealthy. 
Sea Ward. Those whose fortunes are on the rise build 
their homes in Sea Ward, and they join many long-estab-
lished noble families in residence. This area in the north-
west of the city is home to much of the city's wealth, the 
location of the grandest villas of the city's noble families 
(except for those in North Ward). 
Southern Ward. Stables, warehouses, and shops related 
to overland trade dominate Southern Ward. Most residents 
are hardworking folk that load and unload caravan carts, 
and otherwise perform low-paying work. 
Trades Ward. A narrow sl ice of land between the Castle 
Ward and the City of the Dead, Trades Ward is the center 
of commerce for the city, with most of the smaller transac-
tions and respectable trade taking place here. 
City of the Dead. The city's wa lled cemetery, the City of 
the Dead is the only place in Waterdeep where it is legal to 
bury the deceased. It is used by many citizens as a public 
park during the day, a lovely green space of pretty mau-
soleums and grand statues in wh ich to escape the city's 
hustle and bustle. 
Undercliff. While not considered by many to be a ward 
of the city, the little villages and many farms that sprawl 
across the land east of the city were lawfu lly incorporated 
into Waterdeep when it moved a barracks and training fa-
cility to the area.
