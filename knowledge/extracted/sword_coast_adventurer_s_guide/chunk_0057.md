and the riches of trade. The Stoneshafts aren't blind to 
House Margaster's ambitions, and they know that they 
must bring in profits if they hope to weather the chal-
lenges to their home. They're very careful to avoid being 
caught alone, fearing kidnap or torture at the hands 
of hired agents of the Margasters eager to learn the 
secrets of their defenses. For the same reason, only the 
Stoneshaft elders know and plan all the details of those 
defenses, so any single dwarf doesn't know everything 
and can't reveal it. 
Stoneshafts like and are interested in the full variety 
of clothing and fashions, music, jokes and current news 
and rumors, and household goods and tools that Water-
deep offers. They tend to favor maces and morningstars 
and other bludgeoning weapons, plain armor with full-
face helms that conceal a wearer's identity and that 
have plates to protect the vital areas of a knocked-down 
dwarf, and spicy foods. 
ISLAND KINGDOMS 
WHAT MAKES ME SUCH AN EXPERT ON SAILING OFF THE 
Sword Coast? Well, experience, for one. Survival, for an-
other. I've been doing this longer than most of my readers 
have been alive, and this is the third version of this book I'm 
offering. I write one of these only every ha/f-centwy, and if 
you think the purchase price isn't worth the heaps of coin 
you'll make by selling my work to your customers, you're a 
foo l. Don't want it? Don't buy it. 
- Gardorra Burr, to a Waterdhavian bookseller 
West of the Sword Coast lies the Sea of Swords, and 
beyond that the Trackless Sea, a vast expanse separat-
ing Faerftn from whatever lies to the far west. Between 
the shore and the unknown are a number of islands, 
some large and others so small they lack names of their 
own. These island nations trade- and war- with Faerftn 
and one another, just like any mainland nation. 
The information below is drawn from Fifty Years 
at Sea, Volume the Third, by Gardorra Burr, a gnome 
sailor who has spent most of her two hundred years tra-
versing the Sea of Swords. 
MINT ARN 
I don't know what the people of Mintarn did to attract 
Beshaba's ire, but they surely have her attention. For 
as long as I can remember, Mintarn has lived in the 
shadow of the dragon Hoondarrh- called the Red Rage 
of Mintarn since he dwells on an island close by- but 
for just as long, the people of Mintarn have been able 
to purchase the dragon's mercy. Now a series of events 
conspire to threaten their power to pay the dragon, as 
well as their other aspirations on the Sword Coast. 
Mintarn has long been a neutral ground for various 
forces- a place aloof from the conflicts between the city-
states of the coast and the rivalries of the North lander 
isles. Any ship- be it pirate, privateer, or merchant 
vessel- could dock at Mintarn and find a warm wel-
come. Many treaties were struck on its shores, and 
when peace couldn't be achieved, soldiers and ships of 
CHAPTER 2 \THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
Mintarn hired themselves out to various power groups, 
with no fear of retribution on Mintarn. 
Not long ago, Mintarn was awash with coin. Dagult 
Neverember invested heavily in the island, creating a 
ship-building company, combat-training facilities, and 
even lending his coin to the yearly tribute to Hoondarrh 
when other means fell short. The White Sails company 
in which he invested grew to become Mintarn's premi-
nent supplier of mercenary ships and soldiers. 
Things only improved when Waterdeep wasted its 
navy chasing Northlander pirates. Then Neverember, 
acting as Open Lord of Waterdeep, relied on his con-
nections to Mintarn to draft a new mercenary navy for 
the city. What's more, Neverember took it on himself to 
raise Neverwinter from the ashes, hiring more merce-
naries of Mintarn to serve his needs as that city's Lord 
Protector. 
With funds from two of the greatest cities of the 
Sword Coast filling its coffers, Mintarn knew a pros-
perity of which its people had never dreamed. It's true 
that the same tide that had coin flowing into Mintarn 
drew much of its young and vibrant people outward, but 
those they left behind were comforted by the knowledge 
that their family and friends didn't leave for war, but for 
much safer duties. 
The trouble started, not surprisingly, with Hoondarrh. 
Though Mintarn made yearly tributes to the great wyrm 
and was always careful to neglect not a copper, old 
Hoondarrh was known to sleep for decades at a time, 
and the folk of Mintarn took their agreement with the 
dragon for granted. But something awoke him early 
a few years ago, and it was as if the red bastard could 
smell the gold coming into the island. Although Mintarn 
had made proper tribute, Hoondarrh landed atop Castle 
Mintarn, toppling two of its towers with his weight, and 
roared a demand for more treasure, right then, and in 
future tributes. 
Of course, the folk of Mintarn scrambled to meet the 
impatient wyrm's demands. Even if they had all the sol-
diers shipped away to Neverwinter and Waterdeep, what 
could they hope to do to mighty Hoondarrh? 
Things got worse recently when Neverember was 
deposed as Open Lord of Waterdeep. The Lords of 
Waterdeep have decided to reestablish their own navy, 
and they've told the soldiers of Mintarn to leave the city 
or take a commission among the navy or the city's other 
armed forces. Now in Neverwinter, Lord Neverember 
has decided to do away with a mercenary force as well. 
He says he wants to instill a sense of civic pride among 
the folk of Neverwitner, but many in Mintarn see it as 
a betrayal. Neverember is a cunning man. I think with 
Hoondarrh active, the Lord Protector is simply cutting 
his losses. He didn't get the nickname Dagger just 
because his first name is Dagult. 
Mintarn had been playing the game well, but now it 
finds itself backed into a corner with few moves left to 
make. The coin is no longer flowing into its harbors, 
and many of its best and brightest have decided not to 
return. There's talk of hiring adventurers to slay Hoond-
arrh, but Hoondarrh's hoard must be massive. If that's 
not enough of a draw to dragon slayers, then there's
