GREEN-FLAME BLADE 
Evocation cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 5 feet 
Components: V, M (a weapon) 
Duration: Instantaneous 
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must 
make a melee attack with a weapon against one crea-
ture within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. 
On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, 
and green fire leaps from the target to a different crea-
ture of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. 
The second creature takes fire damage equal to your 
spellcasting ability modifier. 
This spell's damage increases when you reach higher 
levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 
fire damage to the target, and the fire damage to the sec-
ond creature increases to 1d8 +your spellcasting ability 
modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th 
level and 17th level.

Evocation cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 15 feet 
Components: V

You create a lash of lightning energy that strikes at one 
creature of your choice that you can see within range. 
The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw 
or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you 
and then take 1d8 lightning damage if it is within 5 
feet of you. 
This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 
5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). 
SWORD BURST 
Conjuration cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 5 feet

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 
5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

CHAPTER 5: BACKGROUNDS 
H E BACK GROU NDS DESCRIBED JN T H E 
Player's Handbook are all found in 
Faerfi n's various societies, in some 
form or another. This chapter offers 
additional backgrounds for characters in 
a Forgotten Realms campaign, many of 
them speci fic to Faerfi n or to the Sword 
Coast and the North in particular. 
As in the Player's Handbook , each of the backgrounds 
presented here provides proficiencies, languages, and 
equipment, as well as a background feature and some-
times a variant form. For personality traits, ideals, 
bonds, and flaws, most of the backgrounds in this chap-
ter use a thematically similar background in the Player's 
Handbook as their fou ndation. 
CITY WATCH 
You have served the community where you grew up, 
standing as its fi rst line of defense against crime. You 
aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible 
enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was 
to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from 
lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe. 
You might have been part of the City Watch of Water-
deep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splen-
dors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy 
nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant 
defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or 
even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard. 
Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served 
as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded 
branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of 
Skilled Hands. 
Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this back-
ground can describe your early years as a member of 
law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have 
their own constables and police forces, and even smaller 
communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready 
to protect their community. 
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Insight 
Languages: Two of your choice 
Equipment: A uniform in the style of your unit and 
indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon 
help, a set of manacles, and a pouch containing 10 gp 
FEATURE: WATCHER'S EYE 
Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with 
lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and crimi-
nals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch 
or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out 
the dens of criminal activity in a community, although 
you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations 
rather than the latter. 
VARIANT: INVESTIGATOR 
Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community's 
investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes 
after the fact. Though such folk are seldom found in 
rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has 
at least one or two watch members who have the skill to 
investigate crime scenes and track down criminals. If 
your prior experience is as an investigator, you have pro-
ficiency in Investigation rather than Athletics. 
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 
Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a member of the city watch. 
Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch 
members or the watch organization itself and almost 
certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably 
involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investi-
gator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving 
justice by successfully solving crimes. 
CLAN CRAFTER 
The Stout Folk are well known for their artisanship 
and the worth of their handiworks, and you have been 
trained in that ancient tradition. For years you labored 
under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours. 
and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to 
gain the fine skills you possess today. 
You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily- par-
ticularly in the North, the shield dwarf clans learned 
long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned 
for their egos than their craft turn away promising 
apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren't a 
dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never 
to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for non-
dwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin's favored 
children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding 
a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential ap-
prentices who came with your recommendation. 
Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight 
Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools 
Languages: Dwarvish or one other of your choice if you 
already speak Dwarvish 
Equipment: A set of artisan's tools with which you are 
proficient, a maker's mark chisel used to mark your 
handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you 
learned your skill from, a set of traveler's clothes, and 
a pouch containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp 
FEATURE: RESPECT OF THE STOUT FOLK 
As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, 
no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You 
always have free room and board in any place where 
shield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individu-
als in such a settlement might vie among themselves to 
determine who can offer you (and possibly your compa-
triots) the finest accommodations and assistance. 
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 
Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the 
Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and moti-
vations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit
