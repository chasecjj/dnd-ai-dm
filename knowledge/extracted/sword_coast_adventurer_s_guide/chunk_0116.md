MONKS 
THE FAT MAN STRAIGHTENED HIS BLACK-AND-GOLD 
vest, lowered his round head, and charged. 
Danica waited until he was right in front of her, and to 
the onlookers it appeared as if the woman would be buried 
beneath mounds of flesh. At the last moment, she dipped 
her head under the fat man's lunging arm, caught his hand, 
and casual/y stepped behind him as he lumbered past. A 
subtle twist of her wrist stopped him dead in his tracks, and 
before he even realized what was happening, Danica kicked 
the back of both his knees, dropping him to a kneel. 
- R.A. Salvatore, Canticle 
Some of the earliest monastic orders in FaerO.n arose in 
the southern lands of Arnn and Calimshan, their prac-
tices migrating north and east at the same time similar 
practices filtered westward from distant Kara-Tur. 
The oldest orders have branched or fractured into 
smaller offshoots over time, such that there are now doz-
ens of them. Most are no more than a few dozen mem-
bers living in an isolated community in the wilderness. 
Some monastic communities have members numbering 
in the hundreds, with a presence closer to civilization, 
and often with correspondingly greater influence, for 
those orders concern themselves with worldly affairs. 
As most monastic orders in FaerO.n arose from human 
nations, the majority of monks in those communities 
tend to be human. Monasteries have long been sanc-
tuaries for foundlings and outcasts of various sorts, so 
nonhuman monks are not unheard of. 
MONASTIC ORDERS 
The following orders can be found in various parts of 
the Forgotten Realms. 
THE DARK MOON 
A monastic order devoted to Shar, the Dark Moon works 
openly in lands where her worship is accepted and in 
secret wilderness and underground hideaways where 
it isn't. Its followers seek "knowledge and conversation 
with the shadow," believing true wisdom is found in 
darkness and loss, both literally and spiritually. Its 
adherents most often follow the Way of Shadow, as de-
scribed in the Monastic Tradition class feature in the 
Player's Handbook. 
THE HIN FIST 
A halfiing monastic order from Luiren, adherents of 
the Hin Fist turn their people's natural confidence into 
a spiritual path for mastering themselves and their 
potential. A few Hin Fist masters have established mon-
asteries in lands outside Luiren, where the teachings 
available only to halfiings have been opened to students 
of other races who are willing to follow the path laid out 
by Yondalla. Hin Fist monks generally follow the Way of 
the Open Hand, as described in the Monastic Tradition 
class feature in the Player's Handbook. 
ORDER OF THE YELLOW ROSE 
Also known as the Disciples of Saint Sollars the 
Twice-Martyred, the Order of the Yellow Rose is a soli-
tary monastery of Ilmater worshipers in the Earthspur 
Mountains of Damara. It is known for loyalty to its al-
lies and destruction to its enemies. Greatly respected 
on matters of truth and diplomacy, the monks work 
hard to survive in their remote sanctuary. The monks 
of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose use the remorhaz 
to test their disciples. Young monks must prove the 
power of their mind to overcome fear and pain by riding 
the beasts. 
The faith of Ilmater fosters far more orders of monks 
that other gods. Other llmatari monastic orders include 
the Followers of the Unhindered Path, the Disciples of 
St. Morgan the Taciturn, and the Sisters of St. Jasper of 
the Rocks.
