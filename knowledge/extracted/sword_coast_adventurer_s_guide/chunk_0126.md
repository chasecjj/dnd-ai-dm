Belaphoss is a demon that serves Demogorgon. It 
considers itself the greatest servitor of the Prince of 
Demons and thus a rival for Demogorgon's power. 
Eltab was once bound beneath the city of Eltabbar in 
Thay, caged even by the layout of the city's streets and 
canals, which formed a glyph of imprisonment. The 
demon is now loose in the world, seeking revenge. 
Errtu the balor has plagued Drizzt Do'Urden for more 
than a century, largely over possession of an artifact 
called the Crenshinibon. Having lost the last battle 
and been banished from the world, the balor now 
seeks indirect means of revenge. 
Gargauth is a mysterious infernal power who seeks 
godhood while trapped in the world within a 
magical shield. 
Lorean is a cambion who collects warlocks like one 
might collect butterflies. His favorite collection, 
the Troil Thirteen, includes warlocks of blood 
descent from the thirteen who first made a pact 
with Asmodeus. 
Malkizid is a solar who fell from grace when he 
betrayed the Seldarine. Ever since then, Malkizid has 
delighted in every wrong he can do to elves, but he 
gains the greatest pleasure when he manipulates the 
elves into harming each other. 
Wendonai is the balor lord who first tempted the dark 
elves to summon demons in the ancient wars between 
the elf peoples. It also turned them to the worship of 
Lolth and continued to advise and tutor them for long 
after the Descent. 
THE GREAT OLD ONE 
Beyond the planes known to great wizards and sages 
lies the Far Realm of the Great Old Ones, beings outside 
time, space, and sanity. That realm is reachable by pro-
fane rituals and in the dreams of some of those drawn to 
those entities' power. Some of the blasphemous names 
associated with that place and its madness include the 
following: 
Dendar the Night Serpent, Eater of the World, is said 
to be the spawn of the first nightmare, devourer of 
foul visions, and harbinger of the end of the world. 
Her warlocks frequently dream of Dendar's hiss and 
the dry rasp of her scales when they first realize their 
potential. 
Ghaunadaur, That Which Lurks, Underdark god 
of aberrations, also known as the Elder Eye. It is 
worshiped (if such a word can be used) by slimes, 
oozes, and similar creatures. 
Kezef the Chaos Hound is a black, skeletal mastiff 
covered in swarming maggots, its blood a black acid. 
The gods imprisoned Kezef in an unbreakable leash 
forged by Gond and a glowing ward conjured by 
Mystra, for which the Chaos Hound bit off Tyr's hand. 
Moander is a dark power of corruption and decay. 
Those touched by its influence first receive a dream, 
the "seed of Meander," wherein the following words 
are heard: "Question not the words of Meander, lest 
you be stricken by the Eating From Within. Go forth 
and possess beings of power and influence for me. 
Slay, and let the rot cover all. Fear me, and obey." 
Tyranthraxus, also called the Possessing Spirit and 
the Flamed One, seeks to rule the world through the 
bodies of others. Similar to the Earthmother, it uses 
magical pools as windows into the world to spread its 
influence. 
Zargon, the Returner, also called the Invincible Tyrant, 
is said to be an undying and unkillable evil. Some 
stories claim Zargon was the original master of the 
Nine Hells. Others claim him to be a powerful Demon 
Prince exiled from the Abyss. Perhaps neither of these 
stories are true, but it can surely be said that Zargon 
is a power that inspires madness and terror. 
OTHERWORLDLY PATRON 
Warlocks in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Otherworldly Patron option, in addition to those in the 
Player's Handbook. 
THE UNDYING 
Death holds no sway over your patron, who has un-
locked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a 
prize- like all power- comes at a price. Once mortal, 
the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the sea-
sons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has 
the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death. 
Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and 
the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying 
Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; 
and the deathless wizard Fistandantalus. 
In the Realms, Undying patrons include Larloch the 
Shadow King, legendary master of Warlock's Crypt, and 
Gilgeam, the God-King of Unther. 
EXPANDED SPELL LIST 
The Undying lets you choose from an expanded list of 
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following 
spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. 
UNDYING EXPANDED SPELLS

4th

AMONG THE DEAD 
Starting at 1st level, you learn the spare the dying can-
trip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also 
have advantage on saving throws against any disease. 
Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an 
undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful 
spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw 
against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the 
save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the 
explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must 
choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead 
of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a suc-
cessful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24
