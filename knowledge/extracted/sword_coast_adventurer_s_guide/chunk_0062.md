Asavir's Channel from Tethyr, is a land of raiding 
pirates. Farther south, some three hundred miles from 
the Moonshaes, is the fabled island of Lan tan, birthplace 
of many odd inventions. Well south of there, beyond the 
jungles of Ch ult, is the mysterious island of Nimbral. 
LANTAN 
I had not visited Lantan for over a year when it hap-
pened, but the way most tell it, when magic failed utterly 
in this place, all the stored smokepowder and magical 
gewgaws in Lantan exploded, one by one, just as great 
waves washed over the island. Within a terrifyingly 
short time, Lantan was no more. 
Or so the stories of survivors went. It appears now 
that Lantan was transferred to another world, much like 
Halruaa. Halruua, though, had foreseen the calamity 
and taken time to prepare. Lantan was not so lucky. 
The Lantanese were fascinated- some say obsessed-
with building mechanical wonders. Though they 
employed magic from time to time, the whole island 
smelled like sawdust, grease, and freshly scraped 
metal, as shop after shop worked on refining its latest 
and greatest invention. The new creation might have 
been little metal knights that walk and fight and knock 
each other over, elaborate coffers with locks that latch 
themselves, or mechanical arms that copy what a scribe 
is writing onto a second sheet of parchment. During 
my past visits there, I'd seen all of those and more with 
my own eyes. 
Were these gewgaws and trifles of help to the Lan-
tanese when the whole world was ripped from under 
them? To whom did they turn when in that other world 
their prayers to their favored god, Gond, went unan-
swered? What happened in their century away, and 
now that they are returned, are they happy to be here, 
or does it seem like their world has once more been 
ripped away? 
Some ships claiming to be from returned Lantan 
have appeared in ports along the Sword Coast, but from 
what I hear, the Lantanese who emerge from them are 
guarded and say little about their homeland. These 
traders seek to attain large quantities of raw materials 
such as various types of woods and metals, trading 
unusual gems and strange gold coins in return. Of their 
inventions, folks have seen little, but the few glimpses 
attained have fueled much speculation about Lantan's 
development of smokepowder weapons and greater 
willingness to blend magic with machinery. Indeed, 
Lantanese traders have reportedly offered many shield 
guardians in private auctions up and down the Sword 
Coast, and such golem-like constructs are usually the 
province of wizards, not tinkerers. 
NELANTHER 
Take an old salt's advice and beware the Pirate Isles of 
the Sea of Swords, the Nelanther. Here, all manner of 
seafaring or sea-dwelling creatures live, from lizardfolk 
and minotaurs to ores and ogres, with a smattering of 
humans and others thrown in for variety. Where some 
pirates hold to their own code of conduct, the folk of 
Nelanther care nothing for rules, honor, or even good, 
neighborly sense: they attack each another as often 
BANNER OF THE 
KNIGHT S OF N1MBRAL 
and as viciously as they do any passing ship or convoy. 
Simply put, the Nelanther Isles are a chain of reavers 
and raiders, who eke out a living fighting whomever 
they can find. 
No one's ever bothered to count or name all the tribes 
of these islands, and I doubt anyone's going to start 
now. For one thing, it's a fool's errand: tribes split up 
or are destroyed at such a rapid pace that by the time 
you finished counting, you'd have to start over anyway. 
For another, it's dirty, dangerous work, and dealing 
with pirates is a task best left to swift ships, well-armed 
navies, and the kinds of fools that would want to count 
them in the first place. 
If you do find out the name of a tribe in the Nelanther, 
be careful about mentioning it to another Nelanther 
ship unless you can confirm that the ship belongs to 
a friendly tribe. Even so, be advised that alliances are 
short as summer storms in these isles, and it's not likely 
you'll be around long enough to witness a new one being 
forged. Proclaiming your allegiance to a certain tribe 
might anger the one you're talking to. 
Still, if you're looking for cheap, strong hands, Nelan-
ther may be the place for you, but don't expect much in 
the way of loyalty or cleverness out of them. Hiring too 
many Nelanther sailors on a ship is just asking for your 
ship to be taken from you, sailed back to the islands, and 
given new life as a pirate vessel. 
NIMBRAL 
Ever seen an island simply disappear? That is, sup-
posedly, what happened to Nimbral at about the time
