DARKHOLD CASTLE 
When l first beheld the great black walls of Darkhold, 
I thought all the legends about it must be true. On my 
second visit, I thought I'd try to confirm my suspicions. 
According to legend, Darkhold's story began more 
then a millennium ago, when it was known as the Keep 
of the Far Hills. It was built as a summer capitol for the 
so-called "giant empires." Situated in the Far Hills, the 
castle was in a position to dominate trade routes north 
out of the Iriaebor Valley. It could also dominate river 
trade down the Yellow Snake Gorge. 
The role of the so-called Giant Emperors is still a 
matter of conjecture and discussion today. However, 
there are some, scattered among the giant tribes of the 
North, who claim to be heirs to the ancient thrones. 
Whatever the truth of the empires might be, the castle 
itself was definitely built for giants. Its size and con-
struction support no other explanation. 
Legend has it that Darkhold was lost to the giants 
due to internal strife-a pair of brothers quarreling over 
their inheritance. Through poison, magic, and merce-
naries, the brothers thinned the castle's population until 
only the brothers themselves were left. The two fought 
and mortally wounded each other, and each dragged 
himself off to die alone. The brothers' spirits are still 
said to stalk the castle, each still seeking his brother's 
destruction. 
The keep was then occupied by a successioh of 
owners, including a dragon of some repute, but it was 
not until a lich claimed it that the castle came to be 
known as Darkhold. The lich was called Varalla, and 
supposedly she conjured all manner of evil creatures 
to serve her, sending them out to dominate the lands 
beyond and establish an empire of evil. Varalla ruled 
Darkhold until the infamous leaders of the old Zhen-
tarim- Manshoon and Fzoul- heard tales of her wealth 
in magic and gold. Lured by the promise of such rich 
rewards, the pair defeated her and claimed the castle for 
themselves. 
Upon my arrival at the great gates to the fortress, I 
found that I was expected, as I must have been watched 
since entering Darkhold Vale-perhaps even before 
then. After a short wait, I was met by a seneschal, a 
forthright woman with a strong handshake, who warmly 
referred to the person who secretly supplied me with the 
history of the Zhentarim. I found myself taken aback by 
this because I had thought my source and I had spoken 
in confidence. As you no doubt have noticed, I've avoided 
mentioning the name, gender, or physical description of 
my source, for I swore an oath of secrecy. Besides my 
initial shock, my exchange with the seneschal was pleas-
ant, and I was given a tour of some of the mighty castle. 
When I asked about the legends of Darkhold's cre-
ation and occupation, she told much the same story as I 
have told, adding a few characters from its history that I 
hadn't heard of before. When asked about castle haunt-
ings, the seneschal only smiled in reply. Although it 
seemed a genuine.smile, I could wring no truth from it. 
Of the castle's defenses, I can say little. My tour was 
limited. But I did note that, while some things on the 
giants' scale have been modified to suit humans (such as 
stairs and most doors), other things remain titanic. For 
instance, I have no idea how they managed to open the 
gates for my entrance without the use of magic. 
DENIZENS OF DARKHOLD 
I didn't see the Pereghost during my visit, so I can't 
confirm anything about the man. But the seneschal 
and everyone else with whom I conversed spoke of 
the Pereghost in awed tones. Whatever the truth of 
this savior of the Zhentarim, he is apparently too busy 
to entertain curious visitors. While at Darkhold, I 
heard the name of another leader of some importance, 
Manxam, but my queries about this figure were redi-
rected to other topics, and I didn't feel comfortable 
pressing the seneschal on the matter. 
Of the rest of Darkhold I can relate only a little more. 
The Zhentarim maintain two war units within Dark-
hold: the Storm Watch, a cadre of veteran Zhentarim 
soldiers who act as heavy infantry, and the Gray Feath-
ers, archers primarily responsible for the defense of 
the fortress. 
These aren't the only forces Darkhold can bring to 
bear, however. The years when a contingent of giants 
lived in Darkhold are long gone, but in their place is an 
aerie of wyverns, bred and trained to defend Darkhold 
and to obey the Pereghost. Their trainer is a ranger 
named Grigarr, whose body is pocked with myriad scars 
from wyvern stings. The man is a greedy wretch who 
claims he is now immune to the wyverns' venom, after 
having been stung so many times. He loves telling sto-
ries in the Rookery about how he got his many stings, 
and thinks himself an entertaining storyteller because 
people listen and applaud. The truth is that the locals 
are terrified of him, so they humor him while he is 
in his cups. 
ELTURGARD 
Ah Elturgard! If any place in the world exemplifies 
humanity's potential for greatness, it is this nascent 
nation. Who could forget the shining sight of a host of 
its Companions, paladins all, riding out on the field, 
banners taught and snapping, breastplates and shields 
agleam with the symbol of Elturgard, and each bearing 
a holy symbol of his or her god-armor for the soul. We 
have no shortage of the good and the just among my 
people, but the sheer zeal and genuine bravado the Com-
panions have in pursuit of righteousness seems to me 
something uniquely human. And it's not just those few 
touched by the gods who seek these high ideals; Eltur-
gard's armed forces swell with men and women who 
aspire to join the Companions. They are the Hellriders, 
so named because long ago warriors of Elturel literally 
rode through a gate into the Nine Hells to pursue and 
destroy devils that had been plaguing their people. With 
these bright examples to look up to, is it any wonder that 
the common people of Elturgard also tend to be devout 
in their pursuit of justice and worship of the gods? 
Oh how bright Elturgard's light burns! If only it could 
last. Humans are, after all, short-lived creatures, and 
fickle in their faith and attentions. Elturgard is the prod-
uct of just a generation or two of humans, and it seems 
implausible that it will last many more. Sadly, I think I 
shall witness Elturgard diminish. But it was a miracle
