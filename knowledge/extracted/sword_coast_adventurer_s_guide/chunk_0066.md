Of course, before this treasure trove can be plumbed, 
one 1!1Ust gain entry to its hallowed halls. The clois-
tered scholar-monks of Candlekeep, who are called the 
Avowed, guard this place and work tirelessly to ensure 
the library's protection and preservation. Though they 
are friendly enough in a workaday fashion, they are also 
suspicious of all visitors to the library. 
GAINING ENTRANCE 
I have assisted more than one visitor with entry into the 
library, so I know the process well. The price of admis-
sion is the donation of a work of writing not already in 
the possession of Candlekeep. Though the monks refer 
to this offering as the "entrance-gift," it is a toll to be 
paid, and often a quite high one. 
To most, this requirement might seem difficult or even 
impossible to fulfill. After all, how is the would-be visitor 
to know exactly what Candlekeep does and does not 
have in its labyrinthine stacks? To this end, most visitors 
come to Candlekeep with multiple books they suspect 
might meet with approval. 
Fortunately for some, the donation need not be utterly 
unique. Some tome or treatise the library doesn't have 
in its archives is preferable, but the monks are open to a 
few other possibilities: rare editions, books with a great 
deal of history tied to them, even tomes with insightful 
(or just interesting) notes scribbled in the margins have 
all been accepted, as have the journals of folk who are 
well traveled or highly learned. 
Most of those who come as petitioners to the gates of 
Candlekeep already know the cost of entry; those who 
don't are told of it at the gates, and turned away kindly 
if they have no such gift. Heralds; priests of the gods 
Oghma, Gond, Deneir, and Milil; certain archmages; 
and others acknowledged as "friends of Candlekeep" 
are permitted to enter without making such a donation 
(though such folk often contribute to the library's vaults 
as a matter of course anyway). 
The great double gates of Candlekeep are as three 
times the height of a human, and wrought of strange 
black metal that seems to repel lightning and to be 
immune to magical divinations, according to at least one 
wizard I've accompanied here. Both of these panels are 
emblazoned with the castle-and-flame sigil of Candle-
keep in their upper reaches. One of the two gates stands 
open far enough to admit visitors during the day, with 
the other kept shut. 
Five purple-vestmented monks tend this entrance. 
One of them steps forward to greet those seeking admis-
sion, discussing with new arrivals their intentions and 
examining what gifts they have brought. As the first 
monk examines an offered gift, determining its title and 
provenance, a second gate guard performs a casting of 
the message spell. The Waterdhavian sage Waldrop tells 
me that the recipient of this spell is an Avowed in a room 
nearby with a massive tome that notes the books in 
Candlekeep's vaults. Apparently aided by magic of some 
kind, that tome-keeper determines if the library has the 
book being offered, and responds concerning whether 
the gift is accepted or not. 
One of the priests of Deneir whom I regularly accom-
pany to Candlekeep has mentioned truth-seeking
