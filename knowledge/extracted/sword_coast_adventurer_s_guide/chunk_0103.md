Rock gnome communities are most common in the 
Western Heartlands and along the coast of the Shining 
Sea; but gnome wanderers travel between communities 
across FaerOn in order to trade with or learn from out-
siders, including members of other races. 
Rock gnomes who leave their communities often find 
work by using their racial aptitudes to their advantage. 
Their heritage and their interest in precious stones 
leads many rock gnomes to become skilled gemcutters 
and jewelers. Rock gnomes also use their affinity with 
machines to work as tinkers, alchemists, and engi-
neers. In human communities, gnome tutors and sages 
are popular, since their comparatively long life spans 
enable them to acquire and pass on knowledge for 
generations. 
Rock gnomes in FaerQn have the racial traits of rock 
gnomes in the Player's Handbook. 
DEEP GNOMES (SVIRFNEBLIN) 
Also known as svirfneblin, the deep gnomes of the Un-
derdark are a stark contrast to their surface kin, dour 
and serious compared to the cheerful and generally 
optimistic rock gnomes and forest gnomes. They share 
their cousins' obsession with privacy, and their homes 
below the surface of FaerOn are well guarded and 
deeply hidden. 
Owing to the hostility of their Underdark neighbors, 
particularly the drow, the settlements and kingdoms of 
svirfneblin are in constant danger of being relocated, 
conquered, or destroyed. Such was the fate of Bling-
denstone, one of the grandest deep gnome strongholds, 
which existed for more than two thousand years until it 
was overrun a little more than a century ago by the dark 
elves of Menzoberranzan. The deep gnomes recently 
reclaimed their old home, and now struggle to rid it of 
malign influences that have crept into the tunnels and 
warrens in their absence. 
Deep gnomes are lean with dark, earthen skin tones 
of gray. Males are bald and beardless, while females 
have hair on their heads. Both sexes have little or no 
body hair and a stone-like look to their skin. 
Deep gnome adventurers are just as curious and 
daring as those of other races. Some find their purpose 
living among other subterranean races, and a few make 
their way to the surface. Those who study the arcane 
arts of illusion in particular often range far from home, 
seeking knowledge unavailable in their own lands. 
SvIRFNEBLIN SuBRACE TRAITS 
The svirfneblin subrace has the gnome traits in the 
Player's Handbook, plus the subrace traits below. Unlike 
other gnomes, svirfneblin tend to be neutral, they weigh 
80 to 120 pounds, and they reach maturity at 25 and live 
200 to 250 years. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in-
creases by 1. 
Superior Darkvision. Your darkvision has a radius 
of 120 feet. 
Stone Camouflage. You have advantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks to hide in rocky terrain. 
Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write 
Undercommon. 
DEEP GNOME FEAT 
If your DM allows the use offeats, your deep gnome char-
acter has the option of taking the following feat. 
Svirfneblin Magic 
Prerequisite: Gnome (deep gnome) 
You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your 
ancestors. This ability allows you to cast nondetection on 
yourself at will, without needing a material component. 
You can also cast each of the following spells once with 
this ability: blindness/deafness, blur, and disguise self. You 
regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish 
a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for 
these spells. 
GNOMISH DEITIES 
Gnomes honor a small pantheon of seven primary dei-
ties, known as the Lords of the Golden Hills, plus two 
other entities. 
WISE PROTECTORS 
The Watchful Protector, Gari Glittergold, is the king of 
gnomish gods, a deity of humor, gemcutting, protection, 
and trickery. His pranks serve to protect gnomes and to 
teach his victims humility and wisdom. Garl's second, 
Gaerdal Ironhand, is the gnomes' war god, who es-
pouses vigilance and defense. 
NATURE GODS 
Baervan Wildwanderer is the gnomish god of forests 
and woodlands, accompanied by his companion Chik-
tikka Fastpaws, a great raccoon said to be the wiser of 
the two. Segojan Earthcaller is god of the wilds beneath 
the earth, rather than upon it, as well as god of burrows 
and the plants and animals found therein. 
SHADOW AND STONE 
Baravar Cloakshadow is the god of illusion and decep-
tion, given the respectful title of Sly One. Callarduran 
Smoothhands is the god of stone and the Underdark, 
patron of the svirfneblin. 
CRAFT AND INVENTION 
Flandal Steelskin, the god of mining and smithcraft, is 
known as the Steelsmith. He is also the gnomes' god 
of physical improvement and good health. The fearless 
Nebelun the Meddler is the god of invention and luck, re-
vered by many gnomes even though he isn't considered 
one of the Lords of the Golden Hills. "Nebelun's head!" 
is a common gnomish exclamation of discovery. 
THE CRAWLER BELOW 
The last member of the gnomish pantheon is Urdlen, 
which appears not as a gnome, but an elephantine, 
blind, pale mole. Urdlen is the great-clawed god of 
bloodlust and evil, of greed and uncontrolled impulses. 
Young gnomes are warned to "never let Urdlen bur-
row into your heart," as a caution against giving in to 
wicked impulses.
