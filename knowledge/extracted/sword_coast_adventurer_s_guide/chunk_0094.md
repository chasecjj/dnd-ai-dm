Moon elves are sometimes seen as frivolous, espe-
cially by other elves. But it is the easygoing, fluid nature 
of their culture, philosophy, and personality that has 
enabled them to survive and flourish during and after 
tragic times in elven history. While communities of 
moon elves can be found in mainland Faerun, many 
moon elves live in the settlements of other races, staying 
for a few seasons or several decades before moving on. 
To a moon elf, home can be among the members of 
one's family, clan, or other friends and loved ones. Moon 
elves who temporarily take up residence in or near sun 
elf communities aren't shy about expressing the opinion 
that their kin need to be less serious. In turn, the sun 
elves pretend to be more annoyed by their moon elf 
neighbors than they truly are, provided that the moon 
elves' whims and adventuresome urges don't cause 
serious disruption. Given that the moon elves usually 
move on before wearing out their welcome, such unrest 
rarely occurs. 
Moon elves have the racial traits of high elves in the 
Player's Handbook. They have pale skin with a bluish 
tint. Their hair runs the gamut of human colors, and 
some moon elves have hair of silvery white or various 
shades of blue. Their eyes are blue or green and have 
gold flecks. 
Given the race's love of travel, exploration, and new 
experiences, many moon elves become adventurers, uti-
lizing their talents for warfare, woodcraft, and wizardry 
in different measures. 
SUN ELVES 
Sun elves, also known as gold elves, or Ar'Tel'Ques-
sir, have a reputation for being arrogant and 
self-important. Many of them believe they are 
Corellon's chosen people and that other races- even 
other elves-are subordinate to them in skill, signifi-
cance, and sophistication. They claim the title of "high 
elves" with pride, and indeed their race is responsible 
for great, and sometimes terrible, achievements. 
Recalling and emphasizing the glorious aspects of 
their history, sun elves subscribe to the principle of 
"elven excellence"- no matter how interesting, excep-
tional, heroic, or noteworthy other races' accomplish-
ments might be, there is an inherent superiority to all 
things elven. This attitude colors sun elves' relations 
with other elves, whom they see as diluted or dimin-
ished representatives of elven culture. Some sun elves 
reject this way of thinking, but it is common enough 
that when most folk of Faerun see a sun elf, they see 
arrogance personified. Their haughty attitude can over-
shadow the fact that most sun elves are also tirelessly 
compassionate and thoughtful champions of good. 
Sun elves have the racial traits of high elves in the 
Player's Handbook. Sun elves have bronze skin. Their 
eyes are black, metallic gold, or metallic silver, and their 
hair is black, metallic copper, or golden blond. 
Sun elf culture and civilization is highly magical in 
nature, thanks to the race's many accomplished wiz-
ards, sages, and crafters. Not every sun elf is a skilled 
practitioner of the Art, but each one has at least a bit of 
inherent magic. Many sun elves mix magic with other 
art forms, which produces the complex dance of the 
RARE ELF SUBRACES 
Other lines of descendants exist of the elves who originally 
came to Faerun, but they are so rare as to be legendary, 
often considered mythical. 
Avariel. The Aril'Tel'Quessir, or winged elves, were among 
the first to settle in Faerun. They are famed for their 
feathered wi ngs and ability to fly. Ancient conflicts with 
dragons nearly wiped them out, and today they are rarely, if 
ever, seen. 
Lythari. The Ly'Tel'Quessir have the ability to polymorph 
into wolves. Unlike werewolves, lythari don't have a hybrid 
form and aren't afflicted by a curse. They dwell together 
in secretive packs, primarily in wolf form, living free in the 
deep wilds of the world. 
Sea Elves. The Alu'Tel'Quessir ("water elves") are an 
aquatic sub race of elves found in the oceans of the world, 
especially off the shores of Fae run and Evermeet. Sea 
elves live along the Sword Coast in close-knit nomadic 
clans, but elsewhere sea elves claim kingdoms in sun-
lit shallows. They have been at war with the sahuagin 
throughout their history. 
Star Elves. The star elves, or Ruar'Tel'Quessir, look 
much like tall moon elves. They dwell on the demiplane 
of Sildeyuir near the Feywild. A conflict with the nilshai, 
a race of worm like sorcerers from the Ethereal Plane, 
forced some star elves to leave their home and come 
to Faerun. 
Wild Elves. The Sy'Tel'Quessir are considered by many 
elves to be the most strange of their race, having aban-
doned or lost much of their ancient culture. 
bladesingers as well as the enchanting music of their 
bards and the meticulous craftwork of their artisans. 
Sun elf adventurers often bring a feeling of noblesse 
oblige to their profession: they venture out into the world 
to challenge its dangers because someone must, and 
who could be better suited? 
Woon ELVES 
Also called copper elves, or Sy'Tel'Quessir, wood elves 
are the most common elves remaining in Faerun. Their 
ancestors left behind the strife of the Crown Wars mil-
lennia ago to found strongholds and settlements deep in 
the forests. Today, most wood elves stand guard over the 
ruins of the past, believing it their duty to preserve their 
fallen glory as an object lesson of the dangers of hubris. 
Wood elves tend to be hardier than other elves, 
more solid and grounded than their cousins. This atti-
tude is reflected in their culture and traditions; wood 
elves tend more toward physical pursuits than do 
other elves, and they view ancient elven history with a 
more critical eye. To the wood elves, the "great" elven 
kingdoms were responsible for many equally great 
mistakes. They look upon the Sundering, the Crown 
Wars, the descent of the drow, and other calamities as 
the result of acts of arrogance on the part of their an-
cestors. Living around and amid the reminders of this 
arrogance, and standing witness to the rise and fall of 
many elven empires, wood elves see the place of elves in 
the world differently than moon or sun elves do. Wood 
elves seek a quiet harmony, not domination, with the 
wider world. 
Sylvan counterparts of the sun elves and moon 
elves, wood elves eschew the cities and strongholds of
