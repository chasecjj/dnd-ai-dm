founding of Helm's Hold, and her quick-rising popularity 
among the people has won her a seat as a Speaker. 
Dominating the skyline of the hold is the great edi-
fice: the Cathedral of Helm. As much a fortification as 
it is a temple, the cathedral has a small building on its 
grounds that serves as an orphanage, wards for caring 
for the sick and injured, as well as a newer addition that 
houses the mad and deformed who have been brought 
up from the catacombs. 
The settlement enjoys prosperity today, but such 
benefit was hard-won and requires vigilance to retain. 
Helm's Hold is vulnerable on many fronts, in large part 
because of its proximity to Neverwinter Wood- which, if 
anything, has become more dangerous in recent times. 
Rumors of maddened treants abound, as well as stories 
of Uthgardt barbarians once again raiding the trails that 
lead to the hold. 
Worse still, the Holy Watcher has seen premonitions 
of something unspeakable rising from the depths 
beneath the hold, bringing down the lowest vaults of the 
cathedral in its bloody ascension. As a result, the temple 
has dramatically increased guard patrols in the tunnels, 
perhaps as a prelude to hiring adventurers to explore 
the tunnels deep under Helm's Hold for some clue of 
what those visions might portend. 
HIGH FOREST 
Anyone with even a hint of elven blood can't help but feel 
it stir upon setting foot in the High Forest. The sheer 
age and the power of the trees, the depth of their roots, 
and the wind whispering through their leaves- all these 
things call to us. 
A vast green cloak in the midst of the North, the High 
Forest is a reminder of ages past, when thick woods 
blanketed much of Faerfin, and sylvan creatures of all 
types lived among the trees. Even today the High Forest 
has barely known the tread and touch of humans, and 
old growth dominates its flora. 
Elven communities in the forest are typically small 
and often nomadic. In part, this is a reflection of the 
desire to keep the woods untouched, but there are ruins 
here, such as those of Ascalhorn- now called Hellgate 
Dell- that remind us of the fallen cities and empires 
of the past. 
The High Forest once sheltered three great elven 
realms beneath its boughs, and the bones of those 
empires still lie tangled in its roots. Many tribes of wood 
elves- and a few moon elf tribes- still roam the wood 
protecting these ruins, the monuments to their golden 
age. Few beyond the borders of the High Forest know 
much about these elves, who have no single leader and 
make little contact with the outside world. Travelers in 
the High Forest must always be wary of elves they meet 
for they can never be sure of their welcome, and any 
promises of safe passage might not be honored by the 
next band of elves. 
One elf is leading the effort to change this situation. 
Known as the Red Lady, or simply the Lady of the Wood, 
Morgwais is a wood elf who seeks to unite the disparate 
tribes. She leads the Caerilcarn, the "Council of the 
Wood," which periodically gathers many tribal leaders 
together to share information, consult, and deliberate. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
Her stated aim is to resurrect the kingdom of Eaerlann, 
and she has made bold steps in that direction by allying 
the settlements of Nordahaeril, Reitheillaethor, and Teu-
veamanthaar (which most know as Tall Trees). As yet 
though, the elves who believe in this vision are small in 
number and spread far apart over the eastern reaches of 
the High Forest. 
Fey and sylvan creatures of all sorts-including satyrs, 
dryads, and treants- inhabit the High Forest. Small 
wonder that one almost immediately feels the presence 
of unseen watchers upon entering the woods. 
Nowhere in the forest is this feeling more palpable 
than near the Grandfather Tree, an oak larger than 
you might imagine possible, which serves as a holy site 
for the Treeghost tribe of the Uthgardt. Four smaller 
oaks- enormous indeed, though still smaller than the 
Grandfather- mark the boundaries of the site, protect-
ing the tree and aiding those whom its spirits determine 
are worthy, speeding their natural healing. Teleporta-
tion magic often goes awry here, and the caverns deep 
beneath the site are rumored to contain all manner of 
magical portals. 
If it isn't the elves, the fey, or the trees themselves 
watching visitors, it might be the centaurs who make 
the High Forest their home, claiming the plateaus near 
the head of the Unicorn Run. For decades, the centaurs 
have been growing in number, enough so that they may 
soon divide their tribes and claim additional lands as 
their territory. Pegasi and unicorns can be found here, 
and even some of the fabled aarakocra, the winged bird-
folk, live among the peaks at the heart of the wood. 
Within the depths of the forest is an entire mountain 
range known as the Star Mounts. Constant strong 
winds keep weaker flying creatures from approaching 
the peaks of the mountains, with the strange excep-
tion of the aarakocra, who had an ancestral homeland 
there before being chased out by a dragon. Most the 
peaks may be viewed only from afar, and at a distance 
they seem to glitter from the strange, massive crystals 
dotting their slopes. They are also known to hold rich 
deposits of iron and nickel, but no one has mined these 
mountains in hundreds of years. 
The Star Mounts are the source of the waters of 
the Unicorn Run, which cuts through the rocks of the 
lower range to form a series of gorges and cliffs known 
as the Sisters. The sight of the tiered waterfalls is 
positively breathtaking, well worth the challenge of 
reaching them. Mist shrouds the Sisters, and feeds 
the vegetation on the small plateaus of the area. To 
the north, the headwaters of the Dessarin River flow 
down from a smaller pair of mountains called the 
Lost Peaks. 
Far less idyllic are the cursed ruins of Karse. Here are 
the remains of the great heresy of the Netherese wizard 
Karsus, who sought to claim godhood, slew the god-
dess of magic, and brought about the end of an age and 
untold destruction across the entire world. 
HIGH MOOR 
The High Moor was once a place much like the High 
Forest or the nearby Misty Forest, but during the Crown 
Wars, thousands of years ago, powerful magic burned
