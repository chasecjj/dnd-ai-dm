HELM'S HOLD 
Helm's Hold has stood as a place of watchfulness and 
protection for generations. Ever since its foundation by 
the Company of Crazed Venturers, travelers have used it 
as a safe place to rest and recuperate on their journeys. 
Even during the dark times when Helm ceased showing 
signs to his faithful, the priests and people at Helm's 
Hold kept their doors open and their eyes on the road, 
providing refuge to any who came in peace. This outlook 
was recently sorely tested, and I'm uncertain if Helm's 
Hold passed or failed the test. 
Even though the Watcher was destroyed just prior to 
the Spellplague, the faithful toiled on through terrible 
times to complete a grand central temple for the good 
of the community and the glory of their god. The kindly 
clergy of this temple, dubbed the Cathedral of Helm 
took in those who had been touched by the plague o~ 
rendered insane by the destruction of Mystra's Weave. 
Sadly, as all too often occurs, corruption crept into the 
settlement, in the form of predatory creatures and male-
factors who sought to experiment on the unfortunates in 
the care of the temple 
In time the leadership of Helm's Hold was itself 
corrupted, falling into the hands of a shapeshifting suc-
cubus, who turned many monks into willing servitors. 
When her machinations were at last revealed and the 
battle for Helm's Hold began, other otherworldly forces 
came to the fore: summoned devils, undead raised 
from the very crypts of the temple, and tentacled, jel-
ly-skinned things whose origin I dare not consider. With 
the aid of adventurers from nearby Neverwinter, all 
were defeated and Helm's Hold at last cleansed. 
ORDER OF THE GILDED EYE 
Among those stalwarts who saved Helm's Hold was a 
member of the Order of the Gauntlet. This man was 
Javen Tarmikos, and seeing the horrors unleashed on 
the world in Helm's Hold, he found his own order at 
fault. The Order of the Gauntlet doesn't punish the crim-
inal before the crime is committed. When evil arises, 
members of the order strike and strike hard, but they 
leave the ores alone in their mountains and don't disturb 
dragons in their slumber. After Helm's Hold, Javen found 
this philosophy flawed. Evils unlooked for can breed in 
the shadows, growing stronger until they attack. This 
seemed particularly true of otherworldly threats, such 
as portals to fiendish realms, evil spirits that seek to 
possess the living, and the corrupting influences of 
alien planes. 
Javen says he was ruminating on this when he 
received a sign of Helm's return. In the main chapel, 
the faithful had erected a new symbol of Helm after the 
last had been desecrated. Javen says he was gazing at 
this symbol and meditating on his order's failure when 
Helm's unblinking eye wept tears of gold. Soon after, 
uncorrupted priests of Helm's Hold, men and women 
who had remained ever watchful for Helm's return, 
experienced their own divine signs. In response to 
prayers, some were even rewarded with spells. Javen 
took those priests and followers from the Order of 
the Gauntlet loyal to him and formed a new order, 
swearing them in under the watchful gaze of Helm's 
still-weeping eye. 
The Order of the Gilded Eye is dedicated to protecting 
the world and good people by rooting out hidden evils 
and severing connections with other planes. According 
to their members, it's not enough to fight threats that 
arise. Many lives can be saved if the signs of evil and 
those who dabble in darkness are actively sought out 
and destroyed before they open the gateways to larger 
threats. Since its founding, the Order of the Gilded 
Eye has grown in number and its capacity to deal with 
threats, welcoming exorcists, abjurers, and spies, as 
well as paladins and clerics of Helm. I've even heard 
that assassins bear the order's symbol- Helm's eye 
upon a golden gauntlet curled into a fist-and it is a 
claim I can't disregard. The Order of the Gilded Eye can 
be brutal in their pursuit of evil. 
Did Helm's symbol weep asJaven Tarmikos and 
others have said? If it did, wasJaven's creation of this 
order Helm's intention? Is the Helm that has returned 
from death different from the god whose worship was 
familiar to me in my youth? How can we mortals know? 
Helm was ever a god of watchfulness and protection, but 
that didn't make him a just god, nor a kindly one. 
Whatever the truth may be, know this: The Order of 
the Gilded Eye controls Helm's Hold now. If you hide 
evil in your heart, or if there is the whiff of something 
otherworldly about you, ride on. You'll find no sanc-
tuary there. 
PLACES AND PEOPLE OF THE HOLD 
Helm's Hold is still a relatively small settlement: a 
handful of streets that encircle a central marketplace, 
with sturdy stone-and-timber embankment walls all 
the way around. In the center of town sits the Heart-
ward, a large marketplace with several rows of stalls 
radiating out from its central feature, an old gallows 
that doesn't see much use these days. The market is 
so named for the shrine to Sune that once stood along 
its edge. That shrine has since been replaced by a 
recently constructed temple to Lady Firehair, called 
the Heartward Hall. 
Not far from Heartward lies the town hall, a former 
inn that has been turned into the council building where 
the Speakers of Helm's Hold meet. The Speakers are 
the duly elected representatives of the hold, numbering 
eight in all, plus the Chief Speaker. The current Chief 
Speaker is Amarandine Wanderfoot, an older halfling 
matron who was an adventurer in her day. The Speak-
ers work closely with the Holy Watcher to see to the 
proper governance of the hold. 
A short distance from the town hall lies the Ventur-
er's Rest, a favorite stopping-off point of adventurers 
in the area, and of the locals who like to sit at the bar 
and listen to the tales such folk bring with them. The 
Rest was until recently called the Old Dirty Dwarf, but 
was rechristened by its new owner, a winsome Chaunt-
ean paladin by the name of Kharissa Anuvien. Dame 
Kharissa claims that one of her ancestors was in the 
Company of Crazed Venturers, associated with the
