those whose businesses are considered too trouble-
some, noisy, or foul-smelling to operate within the walls, 
so tanners, smiths, masons, dyers, and other tradesfolk 
abound. The city does woefully little to help the folk 
here, and charitable souls (myself included) sometimes 
start at one end of the road with a full purse, only to see 
it empty by the time they reach the other end. 
The lack of laws in the Outer City has led to two 
strange phenomena, unrelated to one another. A walled 
Calishite district has grown up to the east of the city 
proper, known by Baldurians as Little Calimshan. 
Within the district, neighborhoods are divided by walls, 
but these walls have walkways atop them so that foot 
traffic can proceed unimpeded by the gates that slow 
carts and mounts. Here, refugees from Calimshan 
have found a home away from that southern nation, 
and largely depend on themselves for trade, culture, 
and defense. 
Buildings have also been constructed along Wyrm's 
Crossing over the Chionthar. Shops, taverns, and tene-
ments choke the bridge, hanging from both spans, and 
even in some cases built to hang from the supports that 
hold it up. Folk must pay a toll to cross on foot or by cart 
or wagon, but many swear they would pay yet more to be 
able to use the bridge without having to dodge the hawk-
ers and urchins that infest the area. 
DAGGERFORD 
Built against the side of a low hill on the floodplains of 
the Delimbiyr, this small, walled town is dominated by 
the keep of the local duchess, Lady Morwen Dagger-
ford. Counting the town itself and the nearby hamlets 
and farms that look to it for protection and guidance, 
some twelve hundred people call the area home. Lady 
Morwen is the sister of the previous duke, Maldwyn 
Daggerford, and she seems a capable and charismatic 
leader. The Daggerford family's authority over the area 
dates back to the ancient Kingdom of'Man that suc-
ceeded Phalorm in the region. Though that realm has 
been dust for centuries, there are those that see Dagger-
ford as the last bastion of a better time of peace, wealth, 
and influence- a time that, given the right leadership, 
has the smallest of chances of being restored. 
Daggerford is a pastoral haven. Wide, sprawling hills 
nearby offer peaceful vistas, but are sometimes overrun 
by raiding ores or goblins. The frequent caravans head-
ing north to Waterdeep or south to Baldur's Gate need 
escort or guarding, and can offer news of both of those 
cities (and the settlements between them). Several inns 
stand ready to accept visitors, except in the busiest of 
trade or festival periods, when they fill swiftly, and many 
locals open up their homes to lodgers. Warriors in need 
of coin can help their purses by offering their services as 
trainers for the local militia, or accompanying the town 
guard on its patrols. 
Daily rulership is in the hands of the Council of 
Guilds, composed of the heads of the town's informal 
trade groups. These guildmasters believe themselves 
more powerful and influential than they truly are, 
imitating the Lords ofWaterdeep by going robed and 
masked to council meetings. This charade, in the eyes 
of most, borders on farce, as everyone in Daggerford 
knows precisely who the council members are, and no 
magic disguises the forms, voices, or mannerisms of the 
guild leaders, and a trained spy can learn which guild-
master is which after only an evening or two of proper 
observation. 
The largest and oldest building in Daggerford is the 
ducal castle, a three-level keep enclosed by a two-story 
wall that contains its own smithy, a wide parade ground, 
and stabling for a large number of animals. The dukes of 
Daggerford have always kept a well-stocked larder, capa-
ble of feeding the castle's inhabitants and any citizens 
that might shelter inside during a siege. 
Three gates lead into the town of Daggerford: River 
Gate, which provides access to the river, and through 
which shipping cargo is carted into the town proper; 
Caravan Gate, which handles most landgoing traffic, 
including land-based trade; and Farmers' Gate, which 
remains open at nearly all times, but is wide enough 
only to let one wagon or cart pass at a time. 
A militia guards Daggerford. Militia service is manda-
tory for all able-bodied adults, and lasts for twenty years. 
All citizens living within the town receive instruction 
from the duchess's own soldiers in the use of spears and 
other weapons, and must spend at least one day a month 
in defense of the town, standing sentry on its walls or 
patrolling the nearby roads. Their training means that 
the common citizens of Daggerford aren't easily cowed 
by armed folk demanding goods, coin, or passage, and 
are slightly more likely to take up work as mercenaries, 
caravan guards, or adventurers. 
Although she is less amiable than her brother was, 
Lady Morwen is acknowledged as more capable of 
ruling Daggerford than Duke Maldwyn had been. She 
is well liked by the people, who understand that she has 
an honorable heart, and wishes what is best for Dagger-
ford. She regularly trains with the militia, and is seen in 
the town wearing armor just as often as she is adorned 
in the finery befitting her station. She often visits the 
local shrine to Tempus, which only enhances her rep-
utation as a pious woman. Lady Morwen's features are 
only now starting to age, as though catching up with her 
white hair. 
Most folk of Daggerford know one another, at least 
casually, by sight. Strangers are usually welcome, 
especially if they have coin to spend, unless such folk 
come armed and belligerent through the town. Guards 
stationed at each gate make note of new faces, but don't 
take action against those they don't recognize unless 
they are given reason to do so. 
The largest of the town's inns, the River Shining 
Tavern, is the second biggest building in Daggerford, 
and the site of many local celebrations and gatherings. 
Here, the wealthy come to eat and relax. The inn is 
old- many locals claim it to be older even than the ducal 
castle- and to many, is the very soul of Daggerford. The 
Silver Flood Inn and Lizard's Gizzard also offer rooms, 
though the latter has no food to provide its guests, 
only beds. 
One of Daggerford's most unusual businesses is the 
Sword Coast Traders' Bank, which accepts deposits 
from traveling merchants and enables them to receive 
these funds at a similar location in either Waterdeep
