your identity as a clan crafter. (For instance, consider 
the words "guild" and "clan" to be interchangeable.) 
Your bond is almost certainly related to the master 
or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you 
produce. Your ideal might have to do with maintaining 
the high quality of your work or preserving the dwarven 
traditions of craftsmanship. 
CLOISTERED SCHOLAR 
As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates 
were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, 
you found your way to one of FaerCm's great institutes 
of learning , where you were apprenticed and taught 
that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold 
or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home- not to 
abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its store-
house of knowledge. 
The most well known of Faerfin's fonts of knowledge 
is Candlekeep. The great library is always in need of 
workers and attendants, some of whom rise through 
the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and 
prominence. You might be one of Candlekeep's own, 
dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most 
complete body of lore and history in all the world. 
Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars 
of the Vault of the Sages or the Map House in Silvery-
moon, and now you have struck out to increase your 
CHAPTER 5 I BACKGROUNDS 
knowledge and to make yourself available to help those 
in other places who seek your expertise. You might be 
one of the few who aid Herald's Holdfast, helping to 
catalogue and maintain records of the information that 
arrives daily from across Faerfin. 
Skill Proficiencies: History, plus your choice of one 
from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion 
Languages: Two of your choice 
Equipment: The scholar's robes of your cloister, a 
writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded 
parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed book 
on the subject of your current study, and a pouch 
containing 10 gp 
FEATURE: LIBRARY ACCESS 
Though others must often endure extensive interviews 
and significant fees to gain access to even the most 
common archives in your library, you have free and easy 
access to the majority of the library, though it might also 
have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, 
or secret to permit anyone immediate access. 
You have a working knowledge of your cloister's per-
sonnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate 
those connections with some ease. 
Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treat-
ment at other libraries across the Realms, as profes-
sional courtesy shown to a fellow scholar. 
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 
Use the tables for the sage background in the Player's 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a cloistered scholar. 
Your bond is almost certainly associated either with 
the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you 
hope to acquire through adventuring. Your ideal is no 
doubt related to how you view the quest for knowledge 
and truth- perhaps as a worthy goal in itself, or maybe 
as a means to a desirable end. 
COURTIER 
In your earlier days, you were a personage of some 
significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organiza-
tion. You might or might not come from an upper-class 
family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of 
your birth, could have secured you this position. 
You might have been one of the many functionaries, 
attendants, and other hangers-on in the Court of Silvery-
moon, or perhaps you traveled in Waterdeep's baroque 
and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of guilds, no-
bles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have 
been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or func-
tionaries in Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter, or you might 
have grown up in and around the castle of Daggerford. 
Even if you are no longer a full-ft edged member of the 
group that gave you your start in life, your relationships 
with your former fellows can be an advantage for you 
and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake 
missions with your new companions that further the 
interest of the organization that gave you your start 
in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while
