WARLOCKS 
Given their dealings with often sinister otherworldly pa-
trons in exchange for power, warlocks don't have a ster-
ling reputation in the Realms. Even well-meaning war-
locks are viewed with suspicion and justifiable caution. 
Some wizards feel the very existence of warlocks taints 
the view of their noble Art and causes the common folk 
to view all practitioners of magic with doubt. 
Some warlocks, particularly those of fey or fiendish 
bloodlines, are born with a propensity for their power, 
drawing the attention of potential patrons even from 
childhood. Others seek out a pact, sometimes because 
they can't find the power they desire elsewhere. Some 
warlocks forge multiple pacts, although they must even-
tually come to favor one over the others, as their patrons 
are jealous and possessive beings. 
PATRONS IN THE REALMS 
The gods are far from the only forces at work in the 
Realms, and ambitious warlocks have many potential 
patrons able to offer them arcane power. 
TuEARCHFEY 
In the vast wilderness of the Realms one can still find 
connections to the Feywild. These are fey crossings, 
places of mysterious natural beauty in the world that 
have a near-perfect mirror in the Feywild. You can pass 
through a fey crossing by entering a clearing, passing 
through the surface of a pool, stepping into a circle of 
mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. A few 
warlocks seek out such places to bargain with the Arch-
fey of that realm for power. Noteworthy Archfey patrons 
include the following: 
Titania, the Summer Queen, is perhaps the mightiest 
of the archfey. With a smile, she can ripen a crop, and 
with a frown, summon wildfires. She rules the seelie 
of the Summer Court. 
Oberon, the Green Lord, an unrivaled hunter and 
woodland warrior, is Titania's lover and frequently 
her foe. Oberon is attuned to every bough of each 
tree and each branch of every stream in the forests of 
the Feywild. If Oberon has a weakness, it is the wild 
nature of his heart. His mood swings like a weather 
vane in a wind storm. 
Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools, is thought to be the first 
satyr. He can sing the shine off gold, and his jokes 
and antics can cause stones to cry with laughter. Yet 
Hyrsam is also the soul of savagery and 
the wild. Hyrsam the Fool is a prankster 
and prone to mischief, but when such jokes 
turn vicious and deadly, Hyrsam the Savage 
is at play. 
The Queen of Air and Darkness rules the 
unseelie of the Gloaming Court from an 
onyx throne that sits empty except for the 
hovering Night Diamond, a black gem the 
size of a human head that dully glimmers 
with captured stars. The Queen of Air 
and Darkness is an invisible presence 
around it, her voice thundering from 
CHAPTER 4 \ CLASSES 
the Night Diamond or whispering secrets directly in 
the ears of her courtiers, and sometimes both at once. 
The Prince of Frost was once known as the Sun 
Prince, but his heart grew cold when his betrothed 
betrayed him and escaped, her soul becoming one 
of the stars. Ever since, the wrathful prince has 
sought to reunite with his betrothed whenever she is 
reincarnated in mortal form. 
THE FIEND 
Numerous fiends forge pacts with mortal warlocks in 
the Realms- so many that warlocks are almost syn-
onymous with infernal power in Faen1n. These fiends 
include the Archdevils of the Nine Hells and their most 
powerful dukes, the Demon Lords of the Abyss, and the 
ultroloths who rule over yugoloth armies. S uch deals 
need not be struck directly with the power in question, 
however. Often a weaker fiend serves as an intermedi-
ary, and the warlock might not know whom he or she 
serves. Notable fiendish patrons peculiar to the Forgot-
ten Realms include the following: 
Baazka is the pit fiend behind the most recent incursion 
of infernal forces from Dragonspear Castle. Its 
plans for the Sword Coast were thwarted along with 
those of allied Red Wizards, but its ambitions in the 
region remain.
