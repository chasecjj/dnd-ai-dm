Though the Uthgardt each belong to a given tribe, 
these are markers of identity, rather than coherent popu-
lations: In my experience, it is rare outside of occasional 
large events (such as the ascension of a new chieftain, or 
certain religious gatherings) for all members of a single 
tribe to come together in one place. Instead, the Uth-
gardt tend to travel in bands, groups of tribesfolk that 
number between a dozen and a hundred, usually twenty 
to fifty. These bands generally consist of several family 
groups, each led by a matriarch or patriarch. In many 
ways, these folk are similar to nomadic Tel'Quessir, in 
that they make their decisions by consensus among the 
heads of the families, and disagreements are handled 
efficiently: those who don't like the decision of the major-
ity go their own way, forming a new band or joining a 
different one. 
The Uthgardt are spread across the North, rarely 
found farther south than the High Forest. There is no 
nation of Uthgardt to which they belong; instead, each 
tribe has a central ancestral mound, regarded as a holy 
site. Gyrt told me that the holy site of the Elk tribe is at 
a place called Flint Rock, somewhere in the Evermoors. 
She, understandably, never offered to take me there, and 
I was never foolish enough to ask. 
By and large, the Uthgardt are a hunting people who 
rely on game for much of their sustenance, favoring 
large herd animals such as elk, rothe, and deer. Young 
men and women looking to make a name for themselves 
sometimes build their reputations by hunting dangerous 
predators and great beasts: bears, great cats, large boar, 
and even monsters such as wyverns, owlbears, and dis-
placer beasts. 
Some tribes put the prowess they demonstrate in 
hunting to good use in another endeavor, for which the 
Uthgardt are well known: raiding. As a rule, the Uth-
gardt engage in raiding only in remote areas- meaning 
that the closer a potential target is to civilization, the 
less likely it will be set upon. The raiders prefer to 
strike against wealthy merchant caravans and nobles' 
baggage trains, which offer the likelihood of fine foods, 
alcohol, and jewelry that Uthgardt wear as trophies and 
trade among themselves. For the most part, Uthgardt 
have little use for coin, so travelers hoping to buy their 
way out of a confrontation are advised to offer some-
thing else. 
Uthgardt don't see national boundaries or the bonds 
of civilization that tie a merchant to a farmer whose 
house the merchant passes on the road. To them each 
interaction with us-meaning we who aren't Uthgart-
is different. Thus, an Uthgardt band that raids in one 
season might come to trade during the next. They do 
understand the concept of belonging to a larger group, 
and that those groups might be in conflict. After all, 
each tribe of Uthgardt has its ancestral enemies among 
the other Uthgardt tribes. Yet when I attempted to 
explain how I, and elf from Evereska, was connected to 
folk in Waterdeep or Silverymoon, Gyrtjust laughed. 
She had not seen these cities, so I might as well have 
said I knew folk who lived on the moon. When I men-
tioned Yartar and Red Larch, places that I knew Gyrt's 
band had passed near, she laughed still harder. To her 
I was too great, too "strong" as she put it, to have any 
THE UTHGARDT TRIB ES AND TH EIR T ERRITORIES 
For most Uthgardt tribes, the only stability in their history 
is the site of their ancestral mound. Most of the Uthgardt 
holy sites have existed since antiquity, but the fortunes of 
the tribes that revere them have hard ly been static. Follow-
ing are brief descriptions of the Uthgardt tribes today. 
Blue Bear. The easternmost of the Uthgardt are the Blue 
Bear-thought destroyed more than a century ago-who 
have recently emerged from inside the High Forest and re-
claimed their ancestral mound at Stone Stand, just south 
of the Moon Pass and north of the forest. The Blue Bears 
have reoccupied much of their old territory in the time 
since they returned to prominence, though they don't ven-
ture near Hel lgate Keep, considering it a taboo place. 
Black Lion and Red Tiger. North of Blue Bear territory, 
in the Glimmering Wood, is Beorunna's Well, a settlement 
of some size that near the ancient ancestral mound of the 
Red Tiger tribe. The settlement was founded some time 
ago by members of the Black Lion tribe, who put down 
roots here rather than continuing to live as nomads. 
Though the Red Tigers are less than comfortable with 
the present situation, they consider Beorunna's Well their 
holy site, so they make the best of things. Bands of Red Ti-
ger tribespeople often winter in Beorunna's Well, and many 
of its hunters and trappers use the settlement as a place to 
se ll the leather and furs they acquire in nearby forests. 
Sky Pony. In a part of the Glimmerwood called the 
Moonwood stands the One Stone, the ancestral mound 
of the Sky Pony tribe. These are a people divided; half of 
the tribe has settled and built a sizable steading around 
the One Stone, similar to what Black Lion has done at 
Beorunna's Well. The other half of the tribe considers this 
act an insult to their totem, so they launch raids on the 
settlement, burning as much of it as they can and then 
escaping, often on pegasus-back. 
Tree Ghost. In the depths of the High Forest stands the 
Grandfather Tree, the ancestral mound of the Tree Ghost 
tribe. The Tree Ghosts split off from the Blue Bears long 
ago and all but disappeared into the forest, although occa-
sional reports reach civilization that they are still alive and 
can sometimes be seen clustered around the Grandfather 
Tree. Some sages postulate that the newly reborn Blue 
Bear tribe might well be Tree Ghost Uthgardt who are fol-
lowing a call from a revived Blue Bear totem. 
Great Worm. The Frost Hills, a small southern spike of 
the Spine of the World Mountains just north of the Ever-
moors, is the site of Great Worm Cavern, the ancestral 
mound of the Great Worm tribe. These Uthgardt are noto-
riously reclusive; it has been twenty years since the tribe 
has sent raiding parties out anywhere but against the ores 
of the Spine Mountains. 
Black Raven. As forbidding as the Spine of the World 
Mountains they roam, the Black Ravens are fanatical in 
their adherence to the old Uthgardt ways. Ranging out 
from Raven Rock, their ancestral mound deep inside the 
mountains, they have been known to send raiding parties 
as far south as Silverymoon, but their most frequent tar-
gets are the caravans that come in and out of Mithral Hal l. 
Elk. Flint Rock in the midst of the Evermoors is the an-
cestral mound of the Elk tribe. The Elk were once prolific 
raiders, extending their reach even into Nesme and Mithral 
Hall, but the tribe was shattered a handful of decades past 
by the forces of those cities. Though their numbers have 
replenished, the Elk remain mostly hunters and foragers. 
They are masters at avoiding or repulsing the threats of 
the Evermoors, and often hire themselves out as guides 
for outsiders.
