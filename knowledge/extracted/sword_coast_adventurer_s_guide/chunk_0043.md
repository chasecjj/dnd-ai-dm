limbs, strange hair color, or shifting forms are fairly 
common sights in Longsaddle, not surprising to locals 
though they might give visitors pause. 
Given the Harpells' reputation as powerful wizards, 
and the sheer number of them, there is no shortage of 
folk poking around Longsaddle and the nearby lands 
hoping to discover caches of magic, hidden like chil-
dren's treasures. Of course, few, if any, such bundles 
exist, but the locals draw no shortage of entertainment 
from sending would-be thieves on grand chases for 
wands, rings, and other magic trinkets that any prudent 
person would realize simply don't exist. After all, if the 
average trader in Longsaddle knew where powerful 
magic was located, he would be more likely, down the 
years, to try to claim it. 
The primary business of Longsaddle is ranching, and 
the lands surrounding the village are dominated by hun-
dreds of ranches and farms of every sort and size, from 
tiny horse farms to great fields of cattle. During those 
days that livestock are brought in for trading, Longsad-
dle is a dusty, noise-filled place, with the sounds of the 
animals competing with the shouts of farmers hoping to 
sell their goods. 
At all other times, it's a quiet, almost sleepy hamlet, 
except when the booming reverberation of a Har-
pell-crafted spell breaks the silence. The family is 
constantly researching magic both old and new, and 
twisting spells and rituals into interesting (to them) 
innovations. This proclivity has prompted them to sur-
round Ivy Mansion with as many magical wards as the 
family can muster, in order to protect the populace from 
an errant explosion, terrifying illusion, or the odd, gal-
loping horse of lightning speeding by. 
Several businesses designed to attract travelers stand 
in Longsaddle, if for no other reason than travel along 
the well-named Long Road can be tiresome. The first 
is the Gilded Horseshoe, an old inn to the west of the 
road that serves fine food and drink, offers comfortable 
beds, and is close enough to the Ivy Mansion that no 
one would dare disturb it or its guests. The owners have 
access to some of the choicest cuts of meat in Longsad-
dle, and as a result, their roasts and stews are exquisite. 
Across the road, the Ostever family serves as the local 
slaughterer and butcher for folk wishing to take meat, 
rather than live animals, away from Longsaddle. Rumor 
holds that the sausages have much improved down the 
years but buyers are advised to "mind the tusks" by 
locals, a reference to an old joke that none remember. 
Folk willing to wait can have the able hands of the 
Ostevers perform a slaughter, hanging, dressing, and 
packing for them, though this process is likely to take 
days longer than most travelers can spare. 
There is entertainment to be had at the Gambling 
Golem, where cheaters in the card or dice games are 
tossed out into the street, and a local marbles game 
known as scattershields is popular. Dry goods, candles, 
lanterns, saddles, rope, and wagon wheels are available 
from a number of other shops. 
It can't be stressed enough that while the Harpetls 
have little interest in the daily running of Longsaddle, it 
is undeniably their town. They rarely suffer insults, and 
never tolerate violence against themselves, their family, 
or the locals. A conflict involving the Harpetls is likely to 
end swiftly and bloodily, and (unless the offender is con-
vincingly apologetic, unconscious, dead, or forgiven of 
the wrongdoing) will often draw additional Harpells to 
support their kin. Harpell supports Harpell in all public 
matters, and no one bothers to record the numbers and 
names of those that forgot that fact. 
Aside from the Harpells, the dominant families of 
Longsaddle are ranchers: the Cadrasz, Emmert, Krom-
lor, Mammlar, Sharnshield, Suldivver, and Zelorrgosz 
families have ranched in or near Longsaddle for genera-
tions, and influence most of the daily life there. They set 
the market days, help resolve disputes among families, 
and broker purchases when a farmer or businessperson 
dies without an heir. They settle smaller matters and 
keep the peace as best they can, knowing full well that 
if the Harpells need to get involved in a dispute, there is 
always the possibility of an offender's being blasted into 
nothingness. 
These families are also the ones most likely to hire 
outsiders to deal with matters on the ranches, whether 
an ore raid or the appearance of lycanthropes in the 
area (though it's rumored that the latter creatures 
may be the descendants of one of the Harpells). The 
major ranching interests often hire adventurers not 
only to further their own aims or provide for defense, 
but to secretly hinder or harm one another and gain an 
advantage in their ongoing competition. Adventurers 
that go too far on such a mission can be explained away 
as foolish outlanders, and if they offend a Harpell and 
get blasted in the middle of the Low Road, there will 
be no one left to ask about the matter. My best advice 
is to be mindful of the scent of magic in the air and act 
accordingly.
