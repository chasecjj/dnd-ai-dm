their folds gears, locks, hooks, and bits of steel, tin, and 
wood that might prove useful in a pinch. They also wear 
belts of large, linked metal medallions and enormous 
sun hats. A traveling priest of Gond offers services to 
distant villages as a tinker, a carpenter, and a civil engi-
neer rolled into one, ready to help build a better paddock 
gate, dig a new well, or mend pots or furniture that 
might otherwise go to waste. All priests of Gond keep 
journals in which they record ideas, inventions, and in-
novations discovered in their travels, and take great de-
light in meeting fellow priests and sharing their finds. In 
large cities, the Gondar construct temples that serve as 
great workshops and inventors' labs. Wandering priests 
turn their journals over to the resident scribes at such 
temples, who then record the priests' observations for 
posterity and the benefit of all. 
Most who favor G9nd practice time-honored crafting 
professions: they are smiths and engineers, architects 
and weavers, leatherworkers and jewelers. Even so, this 
faith has a well-earned reputation as a haven for crack-
pot inventors and visionaries. 
The center of Gond's worship on the Sword Coast lies 
in Baldur's Gate, where the faithful have erected two 
huge structures in honor of the Wonderbringer: a tem-
ple called the High House of Wonders and a museum 
of craft and design called the Hall of Wonders. Lantan 
had been the preeminent place of Gond's worship in the 
world until a century ago, when the island nation dis-
appeared, and since its return the few Lantanese mer-
chants seen in Sword Coast ports have said little about 
the present state of their homeland. 
GWAERON WINDSTROM 
The Mouth of Mielikki, the Master Tracker, the Tracker 
ever Led Astray 
Few aside from rangers of the North pray to Gwaeron 
Windstrom. Said to have been a mortal man elevated to 
godhood by Mielikki, Gwaeron serves rangers as their 
intercessor with Mielikki. He is seen as a master ranger, 
the perfect tracker, a peerless animal handler, and a 
dedicated foe of rapacious creatures such as trolls and 
ores. He is said to look like an old man with a long white 
beard who is still hale and mighty, and he is believed to 
take rest and sleep in a stand of trees near Triboar. 
Rangers pray to Gwaeron because he represents 
much of the work they do, and because he can speak 
to Mielikki on their behalf. In the North, most rangers 
view Mielikki as too mysterious, holy, and wild to be

addressed directly with their requests, but they consider 
Gwaeron Windstrom to be one of them and thus under-
standing of their needs. 
Gwaeron has no temples, but shrines dedicated to 
him can be found in many places that serve wilderness 
wanderers as trail markers. Each one is denoted by a 
carving of Gwaeron's symbol, a paw print with a star on 
the palm, on a prominent tree or stone. 
HELM 
The Watcher, He of the Unsleeping Eyes, the Vigilant 
One 
The god of vigilance and protection, Helm is seen as the 
epitome of the guardian, the watcher, and the guard. He 
is venerated by those who need to remain watchful for 
enemies or danger. Helm is a favorite deity of people 
who make a living by protecting someone or something, 
such as bodyguards, members of the city watch, and the 
guards of a treasury vault. 
Helm embodies the spirit of watchfulness without 
regard to good or evil. In legends, he is honorable and 
keeps his word to a fault, such as when he guarded 
the celestial stairways during the Time of Troubles, 
preventing the gods from ascending them and continu-
ing the chaos of that period, until the Tablets of Fate 
were found. 
Although his faith has known dark days, worship of 
Helm never truly faded away. Most of his followers be-
lieve that the Watcher can never be vanquished utterly, 
and recent events have borne out that assertion. 
Helm's priests teach that one must be ever vigilant, 
ever aware, ever prepared for one's enemies. Patience, 
clear thought, and careful planning will always defeat 
rushed actions in the end. Those who favor Helm strive 
to be alert, clear-headed, and true to their word. These 
traits don't necessarily make them nice people, however, 
and as such many consider the faithful of Helm to be 
inflexible and merciless. 
HOAR 
The Doombringer, Poet of justice 
Hoar, known in the lands along the Inner Sea as Assu-
ran, is a god of revenge and retribution. He isn't typically 
worshiped habitually, but his name is invoked by those 
who seek vengeance. When a guilty party falls prey to 
fate- such as when a murderer escapes prosecution, 
but is then accidentally slain himself- the hand of Hoar
