Your bond could be associated with the company you 
traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades 
you served with. The ideal you embrace largely depends 
on your worldview and your motivation for fighting. 
URBAN BOUNTY HUNTER 
Before you became an adventurer, your life was already 
full of conflict and excitement, because you made a liv-
ing tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people 
who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who 
follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're 
involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, 
that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. 
What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the 
wild would be: you routinely interact with both the crim-
inal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining 
contacts in both areas to help you succeed. 
You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the 
rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the 
city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the 
street, aware of the doings of thieves' guilds and street 
gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one 
who blends in with high society and noble circles in or-
der to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether 
pickpockets or con artists. The community where you 
plied your trade might have been one of Faen1n's great 
metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate, or a 
less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar-any 
place that's large enough to have a steady supply of po-
tential quarries. 
As a member of an adventuring party, you might find 
it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't 
fit with the group's objectives- but on the other hand, 
you can take down much more formidable targets with 
the help of your companions. 
Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among 
Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth 
Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from among one type of 
gaming set, one musical instrument, and thieves' tools 
Equipment: A set of clothes appropriate to your duties 
and a pouch containing 20 gp 
FEATURE: EAR TO THE GROUND 
You are in frequent contact with people in the segment 
of society that your chosen quarries move through. 
These people might be associated with the criminal 
underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, 
or members of high society. This connection comes in 
the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who 
provides information about the people and places of the 
local area. 
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 
Use the tables for the criminal background in the Play-
er's Handbook as the basis for your bounty hunter's 
traits and motivations, modifying the entries when ap-
propriate to suit your identity as a bounty hunter. 
For instance, your bond might involve other bounty 
hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ 
you. Your ideal could be associated with your determina-
tion always to catch your quarry or your desire to main-
tain your reputation for being dependable. 
UTHGARDT TRIBE MEMBER 
Though you might have only recently arrived in civilized 
lands, you are no stranger to the values of cooperation 
and group effort when striving for supremacy. You 
learned these principles, and much more, as a member 
of an Uthgardt tribe. 
Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. 
Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong 
while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos 
and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands 
among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, 
trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uth-
gar chose to raise up the totems among the people as 
living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a 
reminder of who they were and from whence they came. 
The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, 
and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of 
civilization.
