Observer is known to employ groups of adventurers in 
matters of importance to the nation. Though it has many 
paladins and clerics in its ranks, outside assistance is 
essential to the continued defense of the realm. 
THE COMPANION 
The second sun that sits directly above Elturel burns 
night and day. This orb is commonly called the Compan-
ion, but some ascribe it to one deity or another. Where 
the natural sun journeys across the sky and disappears 
at night, the Companion is steady and loyal, ever pre-
venting creatures of darkness from assaulting the city. 
This second sun provides daytime illumination to the 
people of Elturel at all hours, and its illumination is as 
harmful to creatures vulnerable to sunlight as the sun 
is. This constant daylight lessens the farther one travels 
from Elturel, casting a sort of wan dawn light for fifty or 
so miles around the city. Beyond that, the orb is visible 
as a bright beacon in the sky. It ~an be seen clearly at 
night from as far away as Boareskyr Bridge and Ber-
dusk, looking like an unmoving star low on the horizon. 
It might be fairly said that every land touched by its light 
is now under "Elturel's Shield," but such claims raise 
hackles among Elturgard's neighbors. 
THE CREED RESOLUTE 
With no clear sign of the source of the Companion and 
so many faithful arriving in Elturgard each day, the first 
High Observer brought together a cadre of paladins and 
devised the Creed Resolute. This series of oaths and 
maxims outlines, among other things, that those who 
swear by it will not ascribe the Companion to any one 
god, nor allow religious differences to come between 
themselves and others. Those who swear the Creed 
Resolute also promise to serve the High Observer and 
uphold the laws of Elturgard, and always be in service 
to the greater good. While originally the Creed Resolute 
was intended to forge the fractious paladins of Elturgard 
into the Companions, the oath has since been taken by 
all among the Hell riders as well. If a Hellrider or Com-
panion oversteps the bounds of the law or good conduct, 
often a fellow will say "recall the Creed," and soon 
things are set right. 
Though some of the Creed's agents seem unnecessar-
ily stern, the people of Elturgard hold the Hellriders and 
Companions in the highest esteem. The Companions 
are without a doubt the champions of the people first 
and foremost, and the folk of Elturgard love them for 
it. Though it might be hard to get the Companions to 
crack a smile, I've found even the lowliest of the guards 
here willing, without a second thought, to lay down their 
lives in defense of their people, and the folk of Elturgard 
know it. Disrespect the Creed, and it isn't the Creed's 
wrath you face, but that of the local citizenry. 
ELTUREL 
Elturel is a city on a hill. It stands overlooking the River 
Chionthar, constantly illuminated by the Companion. 
A major location along the trade route through the 
Western Heartlands, Elturel and its environs for many 
miles around are a safe haven for visitors and citizens 
alike. Much of this safety comes from the efforts of the 
Hellriders, whose cavalry patrol the roads that lead into 
Elturgard, as well as the paths along the river. 
In the city's center, directly beneath the Companion, is 
a cliff-sided tor that holds aloft the High Hall. This castle, 
whose walls surround the summit of the mount, is home 
to the High Observer, and to a great deal of the bureau-
cracy of Elturgard. A stream runs out of the center of the 
castle, spawned by the powerful springs in its cellars. It 
flows north across the tor's top and then down one of its 
cliffs in a series of waterfalls called the Maidens' Leap. 
By canal it forms a moat for the eastern Dock District, 
before it joins the Chionthar. Along the stream across the 
tor lies the long, narrow garden, an open place of flowers, 
wooded paths, and arched bridges. The garden is a favor-
ite meeting place for citizens of El tu rel and retains a wild 
beauty in winter. The rich folk of the city dwell nearest 
the garden atop the tor, while folk in the town below live 
mostly in tall, narrow homes that are rich in balconies 
and windows. 
Its benefits notwithstanding, the constant illumina-
tion that bathes Elturel can be difficult for newcomers 
to adjust to. Inns and boarding halls usually swathe the 
windows of their guest rooms in thick cloth to block out 
the light so that visitors can get some sleep. Without 
the onset of dawn or dusk to frame the day's labors, cit-
izens rely on the tolling of the bells from the High Hall 
to denote the start and end of the workday. The lack of 
natural darkness means the city sees less of the sorts of 
activities that city folk in other places often undertake 
at night. Elturel has a low incidence of brawling and 
ambushes in the alleys around its inns and taverns, and 
those who would engage in thievery must be especially 
careful and shrewd to succeed. 
OTHER COMMUNITIES 
A few other major settlements of note are located within 
the borders of Elturgard. I describe three of them 
briefly here. 
Berdusk. A large population of artisans drives the 
activity in the city of Berdusk. Its native nobility, the 
so-called "First Folk of Berdusk," have made a great 
show of their piety since the founding of Elturgard, and 
a great many of the high-ranking priests hail from their 
families. Over the years a few bad apples in their midst 
have given Berduskans a reputation for the sin of "false 
piety"- pretending to a stronger faith than one actually 
possesses. Though this attitude is disapproved of by the 
Creed, it has given rise in other parts of Elturgard to the 
expression "as holy as a Berduskan priest"- which is to 
say, not very. 
Scornubel. Known far and wide as the City of Car-
avans, Scornubel is the great trading nexus of the 
Kingdom of Two Suns, and the Elturgard city I am most 
familiar with. Though responsible for a great deal of the 
nation's prosperity, it is also the source of plenty of its 
trouble; Scornubel is a haven for outlanders, many of 
whom are either troublemakers or folk whom trouble is 
pursuing. Add to this the machinations of Scornubel's 
native merchant-princes and the rumors of a thieves' 
guild somewhere in its walls, and it can be understood 
why the saying "The High Observer's headache is 
named Scornubel" has some merit.
