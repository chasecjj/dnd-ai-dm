away is the smell of manure, which in the summer 
months hangs thick over the town. It is that manure 
that helps to feed the true business of Amphail: feeding 
Waterde~p with the produce from the many farms that 
surround the town. 
Because so many of Amphail's farms are owned by 
House Ammakyl, members of that noble family are by 
far the most enriched by the commerce there. They 
consider themselves good landlords to the folk that farm 
their lands, and are sure to bring any threats to honest, 
hard-working commoners to the attention of both the 
Lord Warder and the Lords of Waterdeep. Anything 
that threatens farming in Amphail threatens the City of 
Splendors directly, and such situations are dealt with 
swiftly and surely by the city's Guard. As a result, even 
the most rebellious nobles are careful not to tread too 
heavily on Ammakyl turf in Amphail, as a house that 
does so might swiftly find its favorite foods suddenly 
difficult to procure for a revel or some other event where 
the family's status is at risk. 
BALDUR's GATE 
-------
On the Coast Way, some forty miles upstream along the 
River Chionthar from the Sword Coast, lies the bustling 
city of Baidu r's Gate. Home to tens of thousands, the 
harbor city has poor soil, but its sheltered bay, well away 
from the tides that batter the coast, make it an ideal 
location for trading goods from locations to the west in 
the Sea of Swords, inland along the river, and up and 
down the coast. Baldur's Gate is a place of commerce, 
and the city enjoys great success handling the coins of 
other powers and making them its own. 
Sadly, Baldur's Gate has a storied connection with 
the dark god, Bhaal. Just a few years ago, the city saw 
the terrifying return of the Lord of Murder. Following 
a number of deaths, one of the city's dukes, Torlin 
Silvershield, was revealed as the Chosen of Bhaal, 
and underwent a monstrous transformation, turning 
many citizens into bloodthirsty killers and inspiring a 
riot and much death before finally being put down by 
brave adventurers. Even now, murderous echoes ripple 
through the city and beyond, and reports of unexplain-
able, gruesome killings flow out of Baldur's Gate. 
Baldur's Gate is ruled by the Council of Four, dukes 
who vote among themselves on matters of law and 
policy for the city. A single grand duke is chosen from 
among the four, and is empowered to break ties when 
the council is deadlocked. The current Grand Duke is 
Ulder Ravengard, who is joined by Dukes Thalamra 
Vanthampur, Belynne Stelmane, and Dillard Portyr, the 
former grand duke, who ceded the post to Ravengard 
after the city's recent troubles. Below the council sits the 
Parliament of Peers, a group of about fifty Baldurians 
who meet daily (though almost never in full number) to 
discuss the future of the city and recommend actions for 
the dukes to take on all matters, great and small. At any 
given time, roughly one-quarter of the peers are power-
ful members of Lower City society, with the rest drawn 
from the Upper City's noble families, called patriars. 
Defense of the Upper City is handled by the Watch, 
the official constabulary of the city's elite. Their duty is 
to defend the patriars and enforce their laws, and little 
.:::::.- ·' 
else. For the rest of Baidu r's Gate, security is enforced 
and order maintained by the Flaming Fist mercenary 
company, a supposedly neutral force which is free to 
fight in external conflicts, so long as it doesn't side 
against Baldur's Gate. By tradition, the highest officer 
of the Flaming Fist is one of the city's dukes, and Grand 
Duke Ulder Ravengard fulfills that tradition proudly. 
Membership in the Flaming Fist is fairly easy to achieve, 
and adventurers with much experience swiftly advance 
in rank (and, consequently, political influence) once they 
become permanent members. Many ranking officers are 
former adventurers who have "retired" to military life. 
In both the Upper and Lower Cities, the underworld 
is controlled by a shadowy group known merely as the 
Guild. The dukes don't acknowledge the power of this 
group in any meaningful way- at least not publicly- but 
try (at least nominally) to curb its influence where and 
how they can. I lost count of how many gangs claim ter-
ritory in the Lower and Outer City, and all of them seem 
to owe allegiance to the Guild. Efforts to destroy the 
Guild have thus far failed, due in part to the inability of 
outsiders to identify a clear leader of the group, but in no 
small measure to the shameful lack of effort on the part 
of the rulers of the city to protect its people. 
UPPER CITY 
The Upper City of Baldur's Gate is the enclosed haven 
of the city's nobility- the patriars. Sitting atop their hill, 
the patriars look down on the rest of Baldur's Gate in 
every real sense, wielding their wealth and influence 
to push the Council of Four to protect their lifestyle. 
Though at one time a wealthy merchant or powerful 
adventurer might hope to advance to the ranks of the 
patriars, there is no longer room, physically or other-
wise, for the class of the Upper City to grow. Now, only 
those born into the patriar families inhabit the manors 
of this oldest part of Baldur's Gate. The poorest among 
these go so far as to sell furnishings and decorations 
from inside their homes in order to keep up appear-
ances with their fellow patriars. 
Most would say that the lives of patriars are marked 
by luxury and decadence, and for a great many of them, 
this is likely true. However, some families do make an 
honest attempt at improving the city, and nearly every 
family has at least one member who engages in major
