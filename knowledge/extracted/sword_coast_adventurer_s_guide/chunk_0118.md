MASTERY OF DEATH 
Beginning at 11th level, you use your familiarity with 
death to escape its grasp. When you are reduced to 0 hit 
points, you can expend 1 ki point (no action required) to 
have 1 hit point instead. 
TOUCH OF THE LONG DEATH 
Starting at 17th level, your touch can channel the energy 
of death into a creature. As an action, you touch one 
creature within 5 feet of you, and you expend 1to10 
ki points. The target must make a Constitution saving 
throw, and it takes 2d10 necrotic damage per ki point 
spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a suc-
cessful one. 
WAY OF THE SUN SOUL 
Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their 
own life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach 
that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the in-
domitable light shed by the soul of every living creature. 
RADIANT SUN BOLT 
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you 
can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance. 
You gain a ranged spell attack that you can use with 
the Attack action. The attack has a range of 30 feet. You 
are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modi-
fier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, 
and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain 
monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the 
Monk table. 
When you use the Attack action on your turn to use 
this special attack, you can spend 1 ki point to make two 
additional attacks with it as a bonus action. 
SEARING ARC STRIKE 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into 
searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the 
Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki points to 
cast the 1st-level spell burning hands as a bonus action. 
You can spend additional ki points to cast burning 
hands as a higher level spell. Each additional ki point 
you spend increases the spell's level by 1. The maximum 
number of ki points (2 plus any additional points) that 
you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level 
(round down). 
SEARING SUNBURST 
At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of 
light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As 
an action, you create an orb and hurl it at a point 
you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts 
into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but 
deadly instant. 
Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere 
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or 
take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn't need to 
make the save if the creature is behind total cover that 
is opaque. 
You can increase the sphere's damage by spending 
ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, 
increases the damage by 2d6. 
SUN SHIELD 
At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous aura. 
You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light 
for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore 
the light as a bonus action. 
If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this 
light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant 
damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + 
your Wisdom modifier. 
PALADINS 
Some people are warriors of superior virtue. They ex-
emplify a host of traits that folk consider honorable, just, 
and good. These warriors aspire to be the best people 
they can. When such a warrior also has great devotion 
to a particular deity, that god can reward the faithful 
with a measure of divine power, making that person 
a paladin. 
Different paladin orders in the Forgotten Realms 
emphasize different elements of righteous behavior, but 
all paladins are expected to hold true to a common set 
of virtues: 
Liberality. Be generous and tolerant. 
Good faith. Be honest and keep promises.
