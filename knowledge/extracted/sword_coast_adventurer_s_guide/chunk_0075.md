A 
Hartsvale is far in the windswept north, a fertile 
mountain valley where the Ice Spire Mountains abut 
the High Ice. The Clear Whirl River, easily the clean-
est and coldest I have ever bathed in, flows south into 
the valley out of the lands of the Endless Blizzard, 
feeding the rich soil tucked between the northern and 
southern arms of the Ice Spires. The river splits as it 
runs through the hilly lands, eventually draining into 
a series of lakes along the southern edge of the vale. 
Two small woods also grow in the vale, one along its 
northern edge, between the vale proper and the north-
ern Ice Spires, and another fed by the lakes on its 
southern edge. 
Originally the home of giant clans and ragtag barbar-
ian tribespeople related to the Uthgardt, Hartsvale was 
conquered by the hero Hartkiller. He was a giant who 
had ventured into the lands to the south and learned of 
their ways. When he came to Hartsvale, he rallied the 
human tribes, uniting them into a fighting force capa-
ble of defeating the giants who tyrannized them, and 
they threw the giants down, claiming the vale between 
the mountains for their descendants. 
Giants aplenty still dwell in Hartsvale's mountains 
and forested hills, but they've reached an accord with 
the humans of the vale. So far as I know, they live 
peaceably distant from the human lands, and taboos 
exist among both humans and giants that keep them 
separate. In my time in Hartsvale, I saw no giants, but 
surely I saw their works. At the boundaries of lands 
where humans (and other folk smaller than giants) 
may not go stand titanic menhirs, likely erected by 
stone giants. 
The folk of Hartsvale are ruled by House Hartwick, 
a line of royals supposedly descended from Hartkiller. 
Though human, House Hartwick's scions are all very 
tall and strong, most standing seven feet in height. 
The king of Hartsvale sits on the Alabaster Throne in 
Castle Hartwick, and the many earls of the vale's duch-
ies owe their fealty to him. 
Peace has reigned for many years in Hartsvale. 
Grauman, called the Good King by his people, sits 
the Alabaster Throne, though his years are advanced. 
His eldest son and heir, Taumarik, is a young ranger 
who has recently returned from a three-year journey 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
to explore the North. He came back with a wife, the 
sorceress Ylienna of Silverymoon, and has begun to 
take on more of his father's onerous responsibilities. 
There is some strife in the court, however, for the earls 
don't seem to trust his "out-vale witch-bride" (a phrase 
that infuriates Taumarik, but seems to gently amuse 
Ylienna). For myself, I found the lady Ylienna a delight 
on the one occasion when I was in her company. 
The vale is well guarded, as all jewels should be- in 
this case by the perils of the mountains and giant-
steads that surround it. Nonetheless, a certain strong 
breed of merchant travels the narrow mountain passes 
leading into Hartsvale. The dwarves of Citadel Adbar 
jestingly refer to these people as "goats of coin," for 
they will cling like such animals to the most precarious 
of mountain ridges while seeking the opportunities 
that wait beyond. My own journeys with the goats of 
coin have impressed upon me the skill of these folk, 
who brave crumbling paths, avalanche-ridden passes, 
terrible howling blizzards, and monsters of all sorts to 
reach Hartsvale and get safely out of the vale again. 
It isn't merely the high mountains around the vale 
that hold dangers. Though the valley has scattered 
settlements, all of Hartsvale can hardly be considered 
civilized. In my time traveling these lands (with one of 
the few goats of coin that refused to be daunted by the 
fens around Castle Hartwick), I've found these lands 
to be still frontier-like, similar to some of the wilder 
portions of the North, particularly in the days before 
the founding of Luruar and the resettlement of Mithra! 
Hall. Fell beasts aplenty make their lairs in out-of-the-
way places across the valley, and raiding bands of ogres 
often come down out of the mountains. 
CASTLE HARTWICK AND STAGWICK 
Between two branches of the Clear Whirl River lies 
a great island on which Hartkiller built his castle. 
Stagwick, on the east bank of the river, is a small 
community of folk who work as farmers, fishers, herd-
ers, and artisans. These folk do a brisk business, as 
most outland merchants choose not to journey beyond 
Stagwick and instead sell their wares to the Hartsvale 
merchants. Perhaps a third of the merchants who jour-
ney to Hartsvale choose to undertake the trip out to 
the fiefdoms of the earls, who pay more to encourage 
this behavior. 
THE OGRES 
For reasons I can't fathom, Harstvale and its sur-
rounding mountain ranges host many tribes of 
ogres- indeed, not mere family groups, but whole 
tribes of them! Whereas elsewhere ogres seem to live 
like bears, near Hartsvale they act more like ores. 
Thankfully the brutes are still too stupid for such com-
plex tasks as working metal, but from what I heard 
in my time in the vale their culture is surprisingly 
sophisticated. Different tribes worship different gods, 
Vaprak being the one I heard most about, and these 
differences in religion apparently set the tribes against 
each other. From what I heard, both the giants and the 
people of Hartsvale hate the ogres, a fact for which I'm 
sure many are grateful. If one or more giants decided
