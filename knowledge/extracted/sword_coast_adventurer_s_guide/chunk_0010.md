celebrations varying based on local traditions and popu-
lar faiths. 
Midwinter. The' first festival day of the year is known 
generally as Midwinter, though some people name it 
differently. Nobles and monarchs of the Heartlands look 
to the High Festival of Winter as a day to commemo-
rate or renew alliances. Commoners in the North, the 
Moonsea, and other, colder climes celebrate Deadwinter 
Day as a marking of the midpoint of the cold season, 
with hard times still ahead, but some of the worst 
days now past. 
Greengrass. The traditional beginning of spring, 
Greengrass is celebrated by the display of freshly cut 
flowers (grown in special hothouses wherever the cli-
mate doesn't permit flowers so early) that are given as 
gifts to the gods or spread among the fields in hopes of a 
bountiful and speedy growing season. 
Midsummer. The midpoint of summer is a day of 
feasting, carousing, betrothals, and basking in the 
pleasant weather. Storms on Midsummer night are seen 
as bad omens and signs of ill fortune, and sometimes 
interpreted as divine disapproval of the romances or 
marriages sparked by the day's events. 
Shieldmeet. The great holiday of the Calendar of 
Harptos, Shieldmeet occurs once every four years 
immediately after Midsummer. It is a day for plain 
speaking and open council between rulers and their 
subjects, for the renewal of pacts and contracts, and for 
treaty making between peoples. Many tournaments and 
contests of skill are held on Shieldmeet, and most faiths 
mark the holiday by emphasizing one of their key tenets. 
The next Shieldmeet will be observed in 1492 DR. 
Highharvestide. A day of feasting and thanks, High-
harvestide marks the fall harvest. Most humans give 
thanks to Chauntea on this day for a plentiful bounty be-
fore winter approaches. Many who make their living by 
traveling road or sea set out immediately following the 
holiday, before winter comes on in full force and blocks 
mountain passes and harbors. 
The Feast of the Moon. As nights lengthen and 
winter winds begin to approach, the Feast of the Moon 
is the time when people celebrate their ancestors and 
their honored dead. During festivals on this day, people 
gather to share stories and legends, offer prayers for the 
fallen, and prepare for the coming cold. 
KEEPING TIME FROM DAY TO DAY 
Most people don't keep track of the time of day beyond 
notions such as "mid-morning" or "nigh sunset." If peo-
ple plan to meet at a particular time, they tend to base 
their arrangements around such expressions. 
The concept of hours and minutes exists mainly 
where wealthy people use clocks, but mechanical clocks 
are often unreliable, and rarely are two set to the same 
time. If a local temple or civic structure has a clock that 
tolls out the passing of the hours, people refer to hours 
as "bells," as in "I'll meet you at seven bells." 
THE SHIFTING OF THE SEASONS 
The worlds of Abeir and Tori! drifted apart in 1487 and 
1488 DR. In some places this change was accompanied

The Drawing Down 
by cataclysm, while in others the shift went without no-
tice. Astronomers and navigators who closely watched 
the stars couldn't fail to see that there were nights 
when they seemed to hang in the sky. The winter of 
1487- 1488 lasted longer than normal. It was then noted 
that the solstices and equinoxes had somehow shifted, 
beginning with the spring equinox falling on Green-
grass of 1488 DR. The seasons followed suit, with each 
starting later and ending later. 
This shift in seasons has caused some sages, and the 
priests of Chauntea, to consider changing the marking 
of some of the annual feast days, but most folk counsel 
patience, believing that the seasons will fall back to their 
previous cycle over the coming years. 
A BRIEF HISTORY 
The known history of the Sword Coast region spans 
thousands of years, extending back into the misty ep-
ochs of the creator races and the ages of the first nations 
of the elves and dwarves. Comparatively recent history 
is the story of the rise and deeds of humans and other 
younger races. 
Much of what follows in this section is known mainly 
by sages, some of whom have been alive for the last few 
centuries of Faerfm's history. The common folk across 
the continent have little knowledge of, and little use for, 
events that have transpired far away in time and space. 
News does travel, of course, so even people who live in a 
village along the Sword Coast might get wind of happen-
ings in distant lands. 
THE DAYS OF THUNDER 
Tens of thousands of years ago, empires of reptilian, 
amphibian, and avian peoples- known in Elvish as 
Jqua'Tel'Quessir, the creator races- dominated the 
world. They built great cities of stone and glass, carved 
paths through the wilderness, tamed the great lizards, 
worked mighty magics, shaped the world around them,
