against their upbringing, seeking out the gods of the 
other aspect of their heritage, or feeling a calling or 
need to do so. 
As with any people, half-elves often choose a favored 
deity based on their calling or profession: Corellon Lare-
thian, Azuth, or Mystra for wizards, Solonor Thelandira 
or Mielikki for rangers, Milil or Corellon for poets and 
bards, and so forth. 
Many half-elves worship Sune or Hanali Celani! in ap-
preciation for the love their parents felt for one another, 
and the two goddesses are seen as boon companions. 
Some half-elves are drawn to outsiders such as Auril, 
Eldath, Erevan Ilesere, and Ilmater, or to nature gods 
like Mielikki, Rillifane Rallathil, and Silvanus. Half-
elves from Aglarond often choose Chauntea, Selt'.lne, or 
one of the Seldarine as their patron. 
HALF-0RCS 
Half-ores have existed in the world since before the 
dawn of recorded history, when ores and humans first 
came into contact. Yet, in all that time, they have found 
few places for themselves in Faert'.lnian civilization- or, 
perhaps more accurately, civilization has never made 
room for them. 
Most of the common folk have an aversion to half-ores 
based largely on their appearance: anyone who looks 
that much like an ore, they reason, must be like an ore 
and should be kept at a distance. Because half-ores are 
typically stronger and hardier than their human peers, 
they can find employment in towns and cities, but their 
appearance marks them as outsiders . In response to be-
ing ostracized, half-ores either embrace their otherness 
and take pride in their physical superiority, pull back 
and try not to draw too much attention to themselves, 
or give up trying to fit in anywhere and adopt a nomadic 
lifestyle. 
Half-ores in Faert'.ln have the racial traits of half-ores 
in the Player's Handbook. They speak both Common 
and Ore. The rare written examples of the Ore language 
use the Dethek alphabet. 
BLOOD WILL TELL 
Half-ores ultimately owe their plight to the deity 
Gruumsh, the creator of the ores. Legend has it that 
when Gruumsh discovered all the territories of the 
world had been claimed by other races, he swore the 
ores would avenge themselves by taking what they 
wanted by force. The great ore hordes continue to do 
just that today, appearing periodically from out of the 
wilderness to raid and scavenge. 
As a result, the word "ore" has no pleasant connota-
tion in the minds of other Faert'.lnians. At the same time, 
the word "half" is a mark of derision among ores. Some 
half-ores raised among ores react to this stigma by be-
ing more brutal than others of their tribe, which can put 
them in roles of leadership, but outsider half-ores aren't 
welcomed into ore society because they aren't of pure 
ore blood. And they aren't accepted into other societies 
because of their ore heritage. 
Half-ores are seen as off-putting and intimidating by 
other people, which is both a blessing and a curse, be-
cause while they are often left alone by those who fear 
them, they also become targets of discrimination, or out-
right attacks, from those who feel threatened by them. 
This prejudice against the race makes half-ores slow to 
trust even those who show them courtesy- because they 
all have stories of when they were tricked by such be-
havior. Their ore blood-the Mark of Gruumsh-makes 
them quick to anger and inclined to lash out at those 
who treat them unfairly. 
Having grown up among ores or under the shadow 
of their heritage, half-ores rarely have experience with 
pleasant society, and they often come off as coarse, 
blunt, or rude in dealings with other people. With the 
directness of an ore, they speak their minds with no ap-
parent concern for how their opinions are received. No 
matter where they live, half-ores usually find themselves 
defined by others in terms of their usefulness as heavy 
laborers and soldiers. It is the rare and fortunate few 
who are judged by their character and their deeds rather 
than their ancestry. 
HALF-0RC HOMELANDS 
In lands far from the Sword Coast, such as Thesk and 
Chessenta, there are large communities of half-ores, 
where generations of them have lived as a people in 
their own right. Yet there are few such places in the 
North. A small community was growing near the
