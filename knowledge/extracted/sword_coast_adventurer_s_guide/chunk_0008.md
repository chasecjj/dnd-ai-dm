much of Featherdale for nearly seventy years when the 
war came to an end. 
Before Netheril claimed Sembia as a vassal state, mer-
cenary work and adventuring were popular livelihoods 
among Sembians who didn't have local families to feed. 
Those endeavors are even more popular now among 
veterans of the war, who are better trained than their 
predecessors were. A few of Sembia's less scrupulous 
former soldiers have taken to banditry, which offers other 
Sembians more opportunities for guard work. 
Thay. For centuries one of the greatest concentrations 
of magical might in Faerfin, Thay is ruled by the ancient 
lich, Szass Tam, and the nation's Council of Zulkirs in 
a ruthless magocracy. The council's will is enacted by 
regional tharchions and bureaucrats, leaving the ruling 
Red Wizards to focus on magical study and more im-
portant arcane matters. 
For a time, living mages couldn't hope to advance to 
prominence in Thay: Szass Tam promoted undeath as 
a means of existence with boundless possibilities, and 
held back those who didn't agree with this philosophy. 
The recent battles with the demon Eltab, however, have 
prompted Szass Tam to loosen this stricture- the living 
now have hope of ascending within the Red Wizards, 
even if that hope is merely to advance to a high station 
within the cadre of Tam's servants. 
Thesk. Reminders of the century-old war with the 
Tuigan horde remain throughout Thesk, in the many 
and varied features of its present-day inhabitants, partic-
ularly the half-ore descendants of the mercenaries who 
fought in that great conflict. 
Thesk is known to many as the Gateway to the East 
because it is the western terminus of the Golden Way, 
which runs through the Hordelands and into Kara-Tur. 
Because their city is a crossroads of sorts between 
Faerfin and the east, it should come as no surprise that 
Theskians don't judge outsiders quickly, and don't bris-
tle at visitors who demonstrate strange quirks in speech 
or behavior. The people of Thesk trade readily with any 
folk, even nearby ores and goblins that are willing to 
treat with them peacefully. They aren't fools, however, 
and have no patience for violent or raiding humanoids of 
all sorts. 
Turmish. On the southern shore of the Sea of Fallen 
Stars, Turmish is a nation of mercantile cities ruled 
by its Assembly of Stars, representatives of each of its 
cities in a parliamentary democracy. After being much 
diminished by the devastation wrought in this area a 
century ago, Turmish is currently enjoying a revival 
of its fortunes, as the rising of the waters of the Inner 
Sea has returned some of the trade that was lost in the 
cataclysm. Turmish is the birthplace of the Emerald En-
clave, which has proudly taken credit for the rebirth of 
Turmishan agriculture, the cessation of the great rains 
that plagued the region a few years ago, and the resto-
ration of the god Lathander. 
Tymanther. In decades past, the land of the drag-
onborn claimed as its territory part of what had been 
the vanished nation of Unther. Then Unther suddenly 
returned to Faerfin a few years ago and promptly went 
to war against Tymanther. The realm has since been 
reduced to small tracts mainly along the coast of the 
COIN OF THE REALMS 
Nearly every major power of FaerOn has its own currency: 
coins minted within its borders that represent both its in-
fluence.and material wealth. Most coins of pure composi-
tion and standard weight are accepted at face value across 
the continent, though not every city-state or nation bothers 
to mint every sort of coin. 
Some of the most commonly found, and widely accept-
ed, currency in the Realms is summarized below. Each 
grouping is arranged in order of value: copper, silver, 
electrum, gold, and (when present) platinum. Most people 
across FaerOn refer to coins by whatever name the issuing 
government uses, regardless of origin, except for Zhentil 
Keep-for some reason, all Zhent coins have unflattering 
epithets associated with them. 
Arnn: fander, taran, centaur, danter, roldon 
Cormyr: thumb, falcon, blue eye, golden lion, tricrown 
Sembia: steel pence (an iron coin), hawk, blue eye, noble 
Silverymoon: glint, shield, sword, dragon, unicorn 
Waterdeep: nib, shard, sambar, dragon, sun 
Zhentil Keep: fang ("dung-piece"), talon/naal ("flea-bit"), 
tarenth ("hardhammer"), glory ("weeping wolf"), 
platinum glory ("flat metal gem") 
Silverymoon also mints two special coins: the moon and 
the eclipsed moon. The moon is a crescent-shaped, shin-
ing blue coin of electrum, valued at 2 unicorns in Silvery-
moon and nearby settlements, and 1 unicorn everywhere 
else. The eclipsed moon stamps an electrum moon with a 
darker silver wedge to complete a round coin. It is worth 5 
unicorns within the city, but only 2 unicorns elsewhere. 
Waterdeep has its own coins. The taol is a square piece 
of brass, worth 2 dragons in the city-and virtually worth-
less to anyone not trading with Waterdeep. Most traders 
exchange their taols for standard coins before traveling. 
The "harbor moon" is a palm-sized crescent of platinum 
inset with electrum, and is worth 50 dragons in the city, 30 
dragons elsewhere. Its name comes from its common use 
in buying large amounts of cargo. Both taols and harbor 
moons are pierced to enable the bearer to string multiple 
coins together. 
Baidu r's Gate sets the standard for minting trade 
bars-ingots of metal (usually silver) of an accepted size 
and weight used in lieu of great piles of coins or gems for 
larger transactions. The most common such trade bar is a 
5-pound bar 6 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick, 
valued at 25 gp.
