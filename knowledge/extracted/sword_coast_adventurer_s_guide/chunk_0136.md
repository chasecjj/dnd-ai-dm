heritance right away. Rather than attracting attention 
to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a 
secret until you learn more about what it means to you 
and what it can do for you.

SUGGESTED CHARACTERIS'J'ICS 
Use the tables for the folk hero background in the Play-
er's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motiva-
tions, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit 
your identity as an inheritor. 
Your bond might be directly related to your inheri-
tance, or to the person from whom you received it. Your 
ideal might be influenced by what you know about your 
inheritance, or by what you intend to do with your gift 
once you realize what it is capable of. 
KNIGHT OF THE ORDER 
You belong to an order of knights who have sworn 
oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal 
depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is 
without question a vital and honorable endeavor. FaerO.n 
has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have 
a similar outlook concerning their actions and respon-
sibilities. 
Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted, 
heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly 
orders in FaerO.n don't restrict their membership to such 
individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are 
more important than the gear and fighting style of its 
members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to 
fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are 
willing to battle and die for the order's cause. 
The "Knightly Orders of FaerO.n" sidebar details 
several of the orders that are active at present and is de-
signed to help inform your decision about which group 
you owe allegiance to. 
Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among 
Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate 
for your order 
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical 
instrument 
Languages: One of your choice 
Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, a signet, 
banner or seal representing your place or rank in the 
order, and a pouch containing 10 gp 
FEATURE: KNIGHTLY REGARD 
You receive shelter and succor from members of your 
knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its 
aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid 
from temples and other religious communities of your 
deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the com-
munity- whether a lone settlement or a great nation-
that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can 
find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their 
ideals, and those who share those ideals. 
This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and 
healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky 
assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to 
KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF FAERUN 
Many who rightfully call themselves "knight" earn that title 
as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor's 
Eternal Order or Mystra's Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other 
knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are 
the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal War-
lock Knights ofVaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and 
nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow 
a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of 
extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although 
there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, 
that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily 
being warriors, most folk of Faerun who hear the word 
"knight" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to 
a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. 
Knights of the Unicorn. The Knights of the Unicorn be-
gan as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters 
of patriar families in Baldur's Gate. On a lark, they took 
the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on 
various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they 
faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue's tenets. Over time 
the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in 
places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are 
chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to 
be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken 
on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the 
sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should 
be praised for their strengths and comforted in their 
weaknesses. 
Knights of Myth Drannor. Long ago, the Knights of Myth 
Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove 
Falcon hand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one 
of them. The band took its name to honor the great but 
fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do 
today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand 
decided to reform the group with the primary goal of build-
ing alliances and friendship between the civilized races of 
the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The 
Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the 
Dalelands, and they've begun to spread to the lands be-
yond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are 
above all valiant and honest. 
Knights of the Silver Chalice. The Knights of the Silver 
Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe 
in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe's ethos is the no-
bility's right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is 
incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. 
By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of 
the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper 
heir on the throne ofTethyr and reestablish order in that 
kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most pop-
ular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many 
kn ighthoods in fealty to the crown.
