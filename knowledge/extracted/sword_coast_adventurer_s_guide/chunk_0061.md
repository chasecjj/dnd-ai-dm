We left on good terms, and it wasn't until we were well 
away that we realized we all shared a strange apprehen-
sion. We had not seen much of women while we were on 
the island, which was to be expected since Northlanders 
typically house guests well away from the homes, farms, 
and forges that are the Northlander women's domain. 
But we also neither saw nor heard any children or young 
men, and never once did we see any old men or women. 
Indeed, I hesitate to say that any man among the North-
landers we met had a single gray hair on his head or in 
his beard. This strange fact, and the Rocklanders' weird 
custom of giving any human figure in their art the arms 
of their totem- a many-tentacled squid- makes me leery 
of a return. 
RUATHYM 
The island of Ruathym is the ancestral homeland of 
all the Northlanders who live on the islands of the Sea 
of Swords and the humans who would go on to found 
old Illusk, now Luskan, and spread out as the Illuskan 
people. The warlike folk of Ruathym know they have 
this legacy, and they consider rule over other Northland-
ers and the cities of the coast to be their birthright. 
Merchants can occasionally trade with Rauthym at 
its capital city, also called Ruathym, but I don't risk 
such a stopover if I can help it. One never knows when 
Ruathym is going to be at war, and any ship within sight 
of the island when it is will be fair prey. 
TuERN 
Well to the west of its nearest neighbor, the remote 
island of Tuern is host to violent folk who raid and 
pillage at will and seek to enslave any outlanders they 
capture on or near their island. They trust no magic of 
any kind, and offer tribute to the red dragons and giants 
that dwell in the high mountain caves of this place. They 
have five kings, with a High King supposedly enthroned 
in their capital of Uttersea, but like any sailor with 
sense, I've avoided the island by a great distance, so I 
can't tell you which bloodthirsty knave currently rules 
the roost. 
THE WHALEBONES 
The tiny outcrops that make up the Whalebones are so 
numerous it's impossible to accurately chart them all. 
Each has its own legends and its own (often self-pro-
claimed) king, and they battle one another incessantly 
in skirmishes where the casualties number in the 
dozens, at most. 
The Whalebones are so called because of the scat-
tered skeletons of those great sea creatures that litter 
the beaches of most of the islands. These bones are the 
only real commodity of worth these isles have- which 
means that anyone thinking to simply sail up and pluck 
ivory from the shores of the Whalebones is sorely 
underestimating how furiously its inhabitants defend 
their property. 
0RLUMBOR 
If you're looking to purchase or repair a ship, there is 
no better place to do it along the Sword Coast than 
in Orlumbor. The finest shipwrights in the world live 
here, and their joining work is among the reasons 
Waterdeep remained so strong for so many years. 
Even when much of the city's navy lay disabled in its 
harbor, the strong ships of Orlumbor proved sturdy 
enough that folk could live on and in them while the 
city recovered. 
Orlumbor was once a simple shipwright island, sup-
plying the city-states of the Sword Coast with vessels for 
their navies. Waterdeep in particular relied on Orlum-
bor to supply ships for its defense, making the island a 
wealthy and well-protected place in return. When Lord 
Neverember sank Waterdeep's navy in his fight against 
pirates, he arranged to hire mercenary ships to replace 
the force, funneling ill-gotten proceeds into his own 
pockets, and leaving both the coffers and the shipyards 
of Orlumbor high and dry. After Neverember's ouster, 
Waterdeep's business returned, and with it much of the 
isle's prosperity. 
Reaching Orlumbor by ship is tricky because of the 
rocky, cavernous approach to the harbor. Once a ship 
navigates the route properly, it can find a wider berth, 
and any minor damage to the new visitor is happily 
(and cheaply) repaired by the Orlumbor dockworkers. 
These are folk born and bred to work on ships. The 
homes on Orlumbor are built into the caverns of the 
island, and just as well defended as the docks that are its 
life's blood. 
More than once down the years, Waterdeep's protec-
tion has kept Orlumbor from falling to Mintarn, Luskan, 
Arnn, or Baldur's Gate, all of which have sought to claim 
the islands and its shipyards for their own. None of 
these other places ever considered that Orlumbor might 
simply choose not to build ships for them, but thank-
fully, it's never come to that. Now, Orlumbor once again 
serves Waterdeep, in exchange for coin, foodstuffs, and 
other goods from Faert1n. 
SOUTHERN ISLES 
Off the coast of the southern realms of Faert1n, even 
south of the Moonshae Isles, are some smaller, less 
influential island nations. The Nelanther, just across
