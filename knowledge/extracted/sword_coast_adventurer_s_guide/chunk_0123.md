SWASHBUCKLERS AND Two-WEAPON FIGHTING 
The Swashbuckler relies on a good understanding of the 
D&D rules to realize its potential, specifically when it 
comes to fighting with two weapons. Other characters 
must use an action to Disengage if they want to escape a 
melee, but the Fancy Footwork feature of the Swashbuck-
ler bundles a more limited version of Disengage with in 
your attack. This allows you to use your bonus action to 
fight with two weapons, and then safely evade each foe 
you attacked. 
RAKISH AUDACITY 
Starting at 3rd level, your unmistakable confidence pro-
pels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modi-
fier to your initiative rolls. 
In addition, you don't need advantage on your attack 
roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than 
your target is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for 
the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you. 
PANACHE 
At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguil-
ing. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persua-
sion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) 
check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the 
two of you must share a language. 
If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile 
to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against tar-
gets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks 
against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 
minute, until one of your companions attacks the target 
or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are 
more than 60 feet apart. 
If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't 
hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While 
charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This 
effect ends immediately if you or your companions do 
anything harmful to it. 
ELEGANT MANEUVER 
Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on 
your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Ac-
robatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during 
the same turn. 
MASTER DUELIST 
Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets 
you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with 
an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once 
you do so, you can't use this feature again until you fin-
ish a short or long rest. 
SORCERERS 
The Weave of magic infuses every part of the Realms, 
and some people have the natural ability to perceive, 
touch, and shape the Weave. Some inherit this ability 
from a magical ancestor such as a dragon or an angel, 
others gain it by accident from exposure to wild magical 
power, and others manifest this power by chance or the 
hand of fate, perhaps portended by events at their con-
ception or birth. 
CH APTER 4 I CLASSES 
Due to their varied origins and delayed manifestation 
of powers, sorcerers can be found almost anywhere 
and among almost any people. Larger cities on the 
Sword Coast-including Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, 
and Waterdeep- all have a few sorcerers, since people 
with magic gravitate to places where their abilities are 
valued. Sorcerers are slightly more common among 
cultures steeped in magic, such as among the elves of 
Evermeet and the humans of Halruua. The witches of 
Rashemen are sorcerers who lead that country's society, 
but their Thayan neighbors often persecute the sorcer-
ers who appear in Thay, seeing sorcery as a threat to the 
nation's power structure, which is based on the study of 
wizardry. Magic-hating cultures, such as the Northland-
ers and Uthgardt, exile or kill the sorcerers who mani-
fest among them. 
WILD MAGIC 
The Forgotten Realms has a long history of magical 
disasters and uncontrolled surges of power that alter 
creatures or the land itself. Whether caused by a Neth-
erese wizard trying to become god of magic, deities 
being forced to walk the earth during the Time of 
Troubles, or the chaos of the Spell plague, the magical 
chaos unleashed by such events has created a legacy of 
wild magic sorcerers. This legacy often lies dormant for 
generations, then suddenly manifests under the right 
(or wrong) circumstances. These wild mages are more 
common recently in lands directly affected by the Spell-
plague, including Halruaa, Mulhorand, and pockets of 
Cormyr and the Sword Coast. 
DRACONIC MAGIC 
Dragons are known to take humanoid form and live 
among lesser creatures for decades. Some of these 
dragons have liaisons with humanoids, or invest their 
allies or minions with dragon magic. These invested 
creatures might become draconic bloodline sorcerers, 
or pass their abilities on to their descendants. Draconic 
bloodline sorcerers have appeared in most parts of the 
world due to the actions of individual dragons or exper-
imentation by dragon cults, but they are significantly 
more common around Chessenta, which was once ruled 
by a dragon, and the land of Murghom near Thay, where 
dragon princes have ruled for the last eighty years. 
MAGIC OF THE STORM 
During the Sundering, a constant storm called the 
Great Rain covered the Sea of Fallen Stars, darkening 
the skies and causing massive floods. Thousands of 
people died from drowning, lightning strikes, or bursts 
of wind that hit like fists and capsized ships. A few survi-
vors of these events found themselves blessed or cursed 
with innate magic- storm sorcerers able to bend light-
ning, thunder, and wind to their will. Most of these new 
mages appeared near the Inner Sea, but clouds from the 
Great Rain sometimes traveled much farther away. Al-
though not all storm sorcerers gained their powers from 
the Great Rain, most common folk associate them with 
its destructive weather and treat them with caution.
