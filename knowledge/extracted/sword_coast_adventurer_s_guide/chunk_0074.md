FIELDS OF THE DEAD 
The expanse known as the Fields of the Dead has 
been the battleground for myriad wars and skirmishes 
over the centuries. It is said that the hills that dot the 
countryside here all hold the dead, and there is some 
measure of truth to that- many of the hillocks are 
indeed barrows, raised to house the fallen dead of one 
faction or nation on either side of a war. I have seen 
more than one such barrow, either broken open from 
the outside by those seeking lost treasures, or somehow 
broken from within. 
The Fields of the Dead is a vast, rolling plain of 
windswept grasses that seems to go on to the hori-
zon in every direction. Regular travelers through the 
area speak of the "whispers of the dead," the popular 
term for the sound that results when a breeze rustles 
the grass. The wind almost always blows here, and it 
isn't uncommon to smell salt in the air even dozens of 
leagues inland. 
Though this land is uncivilized, it isn't barren. Even if 
many monsters hide in the tall grass or build burrows 
in the sides of the hills, the fields represent an opportu-
nity for shepherds and free folk to claim a plot that no 
one else has yet occupied. Small, stout farmhouses and 
even a few walled enclosures that contain several such 
dwellings can occasionally be found a short distance 
away from the roads and rivers that run through or near 
the Fields. 
The folk of this land are kind but wary, usually willing 
to share their wells or cisterns, and part with the goods 
they store away in return for goods in trade. I have met 
a few who show greater hospitality, letting strangers 
make camp within the shelter of the low stone walls that 
surround their steadings. They are a good and honest 
people, by and large. 
Away from the vicinity of these settlements, there are 
threats aplenty. Small bands of nomadic humanoids 
traverse these grasslands, as do monsters from out of 
the Wood of Sharp Teeth to the south, the Trollclaws to 
the north, or the serpent kingdom of Najara to the east. 
Occasionally, one of the barrows bulges and vomits 
forth undead, wakened by some instinct known only to 
them, or a patch of terrain buckles and collapses in on 
itself, revealing a sinkhole to warrens beneath. 
DRAGONSPEAR CASTLE 
Though the structure is crumbled and perpetually 
shrouded in mist, more than one of the caravans I've 
guided through these lands have seen Dragonspear 
Castle from afar and expressed a desire to seek shelter 
there. As I tell them at such times, it is better to seek 
shelter inside an opened tomb in these lands, and 
crawl in to huddle among the warrior dead within, than 
to seek anything like sanctuary from Dragonspear. 
Built by an adventurer named Daeros after he found 
a wealth of gems in a sunken dwarven settlement, 
Dragonspear Castle was erected above the very cav-
erns where that settlement- fallen Kanaglym- was 
interred. Two hundred years ago, sorcerous machina-
tions brought about the fall of Daeros and the opening 
of an infernal portal in the depths of the castle. 
After that event, Dragonspear's ruins were occu-
pied by hobgoblins and myriad bands of bandits, until 
Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate sent troops to root them 
out. Discovering that the portal yet existed, but unable 
to destroy it, they established the Hold of Battle Lions, 
a fortified temple of Tempus, in an attempt to prevent 
anything from coming through. In time, though, devils 
broke through new portals inside the castle's walls and 
overran the defenders. 
Then came the S econd Dragonspear War, more than 
a century ago, during which a strange cloak of mist 
settled over the castle, and the forces of Waterdeep 
and Baldur's Gate once more attacked. This time, they 
defeated the devils, leaving the castle ruined and still 
cloaked in mists. At least one other time since then, 
the devils have punched back through, amassing other 
fell creatures to attack the nearby settlements (notably 
Daggerford), but they have been fought off by adventur-
ers each time. The most recent stories tell of heroes 
confronting Red Wizards of Thay and other devilry. I 
pray that this will be the last time such efforts are nec-
essary, but somehow, I think not. 
Today, Dragonspear remains crumbled and mist-
shrouded. Rumors say that the castle-seemingly 
quiescent- has become home to undead horrors of some 
sort, but no one seems terribly inclined to investigate 
such claims, so long as they don't threaten the folk who 
live nearby. Some interested parties out of Baldur's Gate 
offered me more than a fair amount of coin to investi-
gate the truth of these rumors, though I demurred. I 
don't fancy myself an investigator or a spy, and I know 
better than to seek out whatever foulness might have 
taken hold in this place. 
TROLLCLAWS 
A tangled landscape of rough hills along the north-
ern edge of the Fields of the Dead, the Trollclaws are 
home to a great many of the regenerating, bloodthirsty 
beasts. Exactly what makes these hills such prime 
ground for trolls is unknown (and a favorite topic of 
conversation around many of the campfires I've sat at 
while passing through or near this place), but there's 
no doubt that they dwell here in great numbers. 
Those traveling south to Baldur's Gate or north out 
of the Fields of the Dead typically travel through the 
Trollclaws. The Trollclaw Ford, so named for obvious 
reasons, is the only place for leagues that wagons can 
safely cross the Winding Water. Important as it is, the 
site has been occupied by several forces over the years, 
as evidenced by the ruined remnants of forts and similar 
buildings nearby. But those claimants have always fallen 
eventually to prolonged assaults by trolls. My advice is to 
avoid the region entirely, but if you can't, keep a lit torch 
handy at all times. 
HARTS VALE 
-------
I have been to Hartsvale only once, and found it sur-
passingly beautiful each time. Its wonders are wild 
and untamed, with even the so-called civilization of 
the place exuding a kind of primal beauty that is found 
nowhere else that I know of.
