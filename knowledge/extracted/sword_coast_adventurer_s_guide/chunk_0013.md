Fallen Stars had grown, submerging great swaths of 
land beneath its waves. 
Early in 1487, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions 
abounded for months, as if the whole world was con-
vulsing. Rumors spread of chasms caused by the 
Spellplague suddenly vanishing, and stories circulated 
of known destinations being farther away from one 
another, as if the world had quietly added miles of wil-
derness to the distance between them. Word began to 
spread of places and peoples not heard from since the 
Spell plague. It became apparent that some of the effects 
of that terrible time had been reversed. During the year, 
ships claiming to be from Evermeet, Lantan, and Nim-
bral- nations thought vanished or destroyed- sailed 
into ports on the Sword Coast and in the Shining South. 
Tales spread of the legendary skyships of Halruaa being 
spotted in southern skies. No longer engaged in Cormyr, 
Netheril attacked Myth Drannor by floating the City of 
Shade over it. In a struggle for control of Myth Dran-
nor's mythal and the Weave itself, the flying capital of 
Netheril was brought crashing down on Myth Drannor, 
resulting in the cataclysmic destruction of both. 
As the year drew to a close, there were nights when 
the heavens seemed to hang motionless. Throughout 
much of Faeriln, the winter of 1487 and 1488 lasted lon-
ger than any on record. The solstices and equinoxes had 
somehow drifted. Later seasons followed suit, with each 
starting and ending later than expected. Prayers to the 
gods for knowledge and mercy seemed to go unacknowl-
edged, apart from the presence of their Chosen. 
Although the ores were defeated in the North, the 
League of Silver Marches was disbanded in 1488, as 
former allies blamed one another for failures in the war. 
Sembia divided into separate city-states only nominally 
allied with one another. While a handful of settlements 
survived, the Netherese Empire was no more. The re-
mainder of the Netherese forces battle with the Bedine 
over control of the Memory Spire, thought to be a tomb 
of the phaerimm, Netheril's ancient enemies. The battle 
awakens what turns out to be a hive of the creatures, 
and they use the life and magic-draining power of the 
spire against the lands below. 
By 1489, many of the wars that began during the Sun-
dering had ground to a close. Other conflicts arose, and 
mighty threats still imperiled the world, but the deities 
ceased interfering with the world through their Chosen. 
The gods were no longer silent but quiet, and in many 
places new priesthoods arose to interpret the gods' now 
subtle signs. 
The world today seems a place filled with new lands 
and opportunities, where those who dare can leave their 
mark. Students of history and those elves and dwarves 
who recall the past that short-lived humans see as dis-
tant perceive a world much like it was over a century 
ago. For most folk, wild tales of people empowered by 
the gods, and of far-off lands returned to the world, are 
the subjects of fireside chatter. Daily concerns and the 
dangers and opportunities just beyond their doors take 
precedence, and plenty of both remain on the Sword 
Coast and in the North. 
CHAPTER l I WELCOME TO THE REALMS 
MAGIC IN THE REALMS 
From the simplest cantrip to the mightiest workings of 
High Magic, from the blessings of healing mercy to the 
raising of mighty heroes from the dead, magic perme-
ates the Realms. Any understanding of magic begins, 
and ends, with an understanding of the Weave. 
THE WEAVE 
The Weave is an essential element of the universe, 
running through everything in unseen threads. Some 
creatures, objects, and locations have deep, intrinsic 
ties to the Weave and can perform extraordinary feats 
that come naturally to them (a beholder's flight, a vam-
pire's charming gaze, a dragon's breath weapon, and so 
forth). Creatures with the necessary talent and skill can 
also manipulate the Weave to perform magic by cast-
ing spells. 
The Weave isn't normally visible or detectable, even 
through the use of spells. Detect magic doesn't let you 
perceive the Weave, for instance. The Weave isn't magic, 
precisely, any more than a collection of threads is a gar-
ment; it's the raw material from which the tapestry of 
magic is woven. 
In two senses, both the metaphorical and the real, 
the goddess Mystra is the Weave. She is its keeper 
and tender, but all three times the goddess of magic 
has died or been separated from her divinity (twice as 
Mystra, and once as her predecessor, Mystryl), magic 
has been twisted or has failed entirely. With Mystra's 
last death and the coming of the Spellplague, the 
Weave was thought destroyed, and the term lost its 
significance. Since the end of the most recent Sunder-
ing, both Mystra and the Weave have returned to their 
roles of centuries past, and spells and magic items 
are more reliable than they had been while the Spell-
plague raged. 
SUPERNATURAL POWERS 
AND PSIONICS 
The inborn magical abilities of certain creatures, the 
acquired supernatural powers of people such as monks, 
and psionic abilities are similar in that their users don't 
manipulate the Weave in the customary way that spell-
casters do. The mental state of the user is vitally import-
ant: monks and some psionics-users train long and hard 
to attain the right frame of mind, while creatures with 
supernatural powers have that mind-set in their nature. 
How these abilities are related to the Weave remains a 
matter of debate; many students of the arcane believe 
that the use of the so-called Unseen Art is an aspect of 
magical talent that can't be directly studied or taught. 
MAGIC ITEMS 
Where a spell effect is brought to life by manipulating 
the threads of the Weave, the creation of a magic item 
ties some of those threads together in a specific way, to 
produce the desired effect for as long as the item lasts. 
The Weave provides immediately available energy for 
spells and also enables those who know the craft to har-
