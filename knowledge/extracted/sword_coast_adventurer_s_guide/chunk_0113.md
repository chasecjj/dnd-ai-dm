A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move 
as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end 
its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't 
take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash 
action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it 
from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature 
can use the Dodge action. 
After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its sav-
ing throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the 
creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the banishment 
spell, no concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of 
origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain 
threshold, as shown on the Arcane Banishment table.

SPELL BREAKER 
Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an 
ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end 
one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the 
spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of 
the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell. 
POTENT SPELLCASTING 
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to 
the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. 
ARCANE MASTERY 
At 17th level, you choose four spells from the wizard 
spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 
8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. 
Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared 
and count as cleric spells for you. 
DRUIDS 
The druids of the Realms venerate nature in all its 
forms, as well as the gods of the First Circle, those 
deities closest to the power and majesty of the natural 
world. That group of gods includes Chauntea, Eldath, 
Mielikki, Silvanus, as well as Auril, Matar, Talos, and 
Umberlee, for nature is many-sided and not always kind. 
Unlike clerics, who typically serve a single deity, dru-
ids revere all the gods of the First Circle in their turn, 
and see them as embodiments of the natural world, 
which moves in cycles: creation and destruction, waxing 
and withering, life and death. Thus, Grumbar isn't just 
god of the earth to a druid; he is the fertile soil and the 
rolling hills themselves. Malar isn't just the Beastlord, 
but the hunger and the hunting instinct of a preda-
tory beast. 
Although they are most strongly associated with 
sylvan forests, druids care for all aspects of the land, in-
cluding frozen mountains, burning deserts, rolling hills, 
and rough coasts. 
CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 
DRUID CIRCLES 
Druidic ways are ancient and largely practiced in secret, 
away from the eyes of the uninitiated. In many lands, 
the Old Ways of the First Circle have given way to new 
churches and temples, but druids and their followers 
still gather to honor the cycles of nature and to ensure 
the natural balance isn't threatened. People who dwell 
in or near wild lands do well to learn if a druid circle 
operates nearby, seeking the circle's blessing before 
hunting or farming on the lands they protect. 
The druid habit of gathering in clearings, wooded 
groves, or around sacred pools gave rise to the tradition 
of circles. In a circle, all are equal, and while respect is 
given to age and accomplishment, the circle reaches de-
cisions as a whole. Those who disagree are free to argue 
their point, or even to leave the circle, if they wish, but 
the circle acts as one for the good of all. Druid circles 
often include non-druid allies, such as rangers, wood 
elves, and the fey creatures of the lancf where the circle 
meets, all given equal voice. 
Numerous circles are found across Faerfm, usually 
made up of no more than a dozen or so druids, plus 
their allies. They include the High Dance, guarding the
