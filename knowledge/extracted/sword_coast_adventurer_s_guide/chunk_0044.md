MIRA BAR 
Mirabar is a human city that rests atop dwarven cav-
erns. On the surface, humans dominate the population, 
with some dwarves mixed in, and a handful of gnomes 
and halflings. The uppermost level of the undercity is 
mostly dwarves, with some few humans. The mixing 
of races is due to convenience of trade, preference, or 
skill; just as some few humans like to mine, to imbibe 
strong dwarven drink, and to work underground, so do 
a minority of dwarves take to the open sky, doing dock 
work, or even manning and building ships. The lower 
levels beneath Mirabar are all dwarven, as even the 
most dwarf-like human can live so deep below ground 
for only so long. Almost all of its citizens, regardless 
of race, honor Moradin and the dwarven gods, making 
Mirabar a dwarven city in spirit and ethics, if not 
entirely by population, much in the way my own Silvery-
moon speaks to elven ideals of natural beauty. 
Long ago, the great dwarven kingdom of Gharraghaur 
stood to the west of Delzoun, delving mines near the 
River Mirar and finding great, near-endless veins of 
gems. Like many of the dwarven realms, Gharraghaur 
fell to marauding ores, which destroyed the kingdom 
and its capital city but couldn't take advantage of the 
wealth therein. For millennia the lower city lay empty, 
until some eight hundred years ago, when Prince Ere-
skas of Arnn settled the same spot, creating the city 
of Mirabar (coincidentally echoing the dwarven "-bar" 
naming convention used for citadels throughout the 
North). It was only when dwarves returned to work 
the mines below that Mirabar began to see its for-
tunes increase. 
Mirabar is ruled by its hereditary marchion, Selin 
Raurym, who issues edicts fed to him by the Council 
of Sparkling Stones. The council is a group of dwarves 
EVERBRIGHT 
The dwarves were the first to discover the secret of treating 
their metal with everbright. The technique has been imi-
tated by other races, to varying degrees of success. Armor, 
weapons, and other metal objects to which everbright is 
applied maintain their luster without needing to be pol-
ished, and are resistant to natural (and, in some cases, 
magical) pitting, rusting, and tarnishing. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
and some few humans elected to make policy for the 
city, who determine where the output of Mirabar's mines 
will be sold. Although the council has long kept Mirabar 
associated with the Lords' Alliance, it is the marchion 
who negotiates with his fellow lords. Thus far, Selin 
Raurym has proved far more capable than his predeces-
sors at making beneficial decisions for the city, and the 
council has given him great leeway to speak for Mirabar 
outside the walls. His threat to pull out of the Alliance 
following its failure to aid the northern cities against the 
most recent ore hordes, though considered by some an 
empty gesture, has brought Mirabar more advantageous 
relationships with Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, some-
thing which has not gone unappreciated by the council. 
The city's guard, the Axe of Mirabar, exists primarily 
to deter and prevent sabotage of the mines, without 
which Mirabar would collapse. The guard also pro-
vides swift and capable defense and law enforcement 
within the city. The wealth of Mirabar is so great that it 
maintains docks, ships, and fortified harbors on many 
of the islands in the S ea of Swords, and as such the 
city is always seeking magical and military support for 
these defenses. Where other cities might use such vast 
mountains of coin as Mirabar possesses on shows of 
prosperity, Mirabarrens use it for more functional goals, 
making sure that the city's defenses are new, that its 
gates close securely when they are moved, that its build-
ings and walls are strong and secure. Given the recent 
destruction of Sundabar's surface city at the hand of 
ore armies, such expenditures are well justified, since 
no one in Mirabar wishes to see the surface city wiped 
out. It would simply be bad for business. Mirabar spares 
no expense in defending its wealth, and hires as many 
mages and adventurers as necessary to clear threats 
away from roads, investigate sabotage, and otherwise 
protect its vital trade. 
With the rise of Mithra! Hall in the last century, and 
now Gauntlgrym, Mirabar fears its place as the armory 
of the North is at risk. 'The miners, smelters, and smiths 
of Mirabar work ever harder to increase their output and 
improve their craft, while the jewelers and enamelers 
study ways to incorporate ancient techniques of melding 
dwarven, human, and elven designs together in their 
work, in the manner of old Phalorm. 
Mirabarren (or to some, just Mierren) dwarves like to 
cultivate long, wide (as opposed to tapered or pointed) 
beards and tight braids of hair growing elsewhere than 
on the chin, a fashion copied by some local humans. 
They love polished, everbright-treated sheets of metal, 
particularly copper, used as doors or mirrorlike wall-
panel inlays. They often set gems into the pommels 
and nonworking ends of tools and weapons. Mierren 
dwarves tend to be wealthy, to have personal collections 
of unusual and rare gems, to use seals made of gems 
carved into signet rings, and to be investors in ventures 
(rather than property) up and down the Sword Coast. 
They are sophisticated and worldly, and they decry the 
isolationist and xenophobic attitudes of some dwarves. 
Mierren dwarves demonstrate their own broader 
attitudes by being the diplomatic traders and power 
brokers in trademoots and agreements in Fireshear and 
Neverwinter and everywhere else they can worm their
