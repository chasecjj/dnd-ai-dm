OPTION: HUMAN LANGUAGES 
Many human ethnicities and nations in FaerOn have their 
own language, in addition to Common. Most human 
languages are written in Thorass, the alphabet of Old 
Common , derived from the Chondathan language that 
traders used as their common tongue. A few human lan-
guages use other alphabets, including Draconic, Dethek, 
and Espruar. The languages of the ethnicities described in 
the Player's Handbook and this book are as follows: 
Arkaiun: Dambrathan (written in Espruar) 
Bedine: Midani 
Calishite: Alzhedo 
Chondathan: Chondathan 
Damaran: Damaran (written in Dethek) 
Ffolk: Waelan 
Cur: Gu ran (a patois of Roushoum and Rashemi) 
Halruaan: Halruaan (written in Draconic) 
llluskan: llluskan 
lmaskari: Roushoum 
Mulan: Chessentan, Mulhorandi, Untheric, orThayan 
Nar: Damaran 
Rashemi: Rashemi 
Shaaran: Shaaran (written in Dethek) 
Shou:Shou 
Tethyrian: Chondathan 
Tuigan: Tuigan 
Turami: Turmic 
Ulutiun: Uluik 
If your Dungeon Master allows this option, then any hu-
man from an ethnic group that has its own language is 
assumed to know that language as well as Common. This 
ethn ic language is treated as a free add itional language for 
such individuals. 
being defeated by a coalition of armies. Since those 
days, Tuigans are sometimes seen on the Sword Coast 
and in other nearby regions, but not in great numbers. 
The Tuigans resemble the Shou, with a bronze or 
golden cast to their skin and dark hair, but they tend to 
have darker skin and broader features. Each has only a 
single name (sometimes handed down from one's par-
ent); Tuigans don't use surnames. No strangers to travel, 
Tuigan traders and adventurers are often familiar with 
many languages and cultures. 
Tuigan Names: (Male) Atlan, Bayar, Chingis, Chinua, 
Mongke, Temur; (female) Bolormaa, Bortai, 
Erdene, Naran 
ULUTIUN 
The Ulutiuns are short, dark-haired, golden-skinned 
people who originated in northern Kara-Tur and migrat-
ed westward to Icewind Dale and other cold lands near 
the Endless Ice Sea. Hunters and gatherers, Ulutiuns 
live in small tribes that have managed to survive in one 
of the harshest environments in the world. Each has 
only a single name (sometimes handed down from one's 
parent); Ulutiuns don't use surnames. 
Ulutiun Names: (Male) Amak, Chu, Imnek, Kanut, Siku; 
(female) Akna, Chena, Kaya, Sedna, Ublereak 
CHAPTER 3 I RACES OF THE REALMS 
HUMANS' DEITIES 
The breadth and variety of the human race in Faerfm 
is never more evident than in the diverse collection of 
deities that humans worship. The Faerfinian pantheon 
(detailed in chapter 1) includes gods of every stripe, 
and a number of deities whose spheres of influence 
overlap and compete, which seems to be just how hu-
mans like it. 
Along the Sword Coast, most human communities 
have temples and shrines tended by prjests who are 
devoted to various Faerilnian gods. In some of these 
places, the faithful of deities revered by rulers and other 
powerful individuals play a greater role in local politics 
than those not so favored. In the extreme, worship that 
is deemed heretical or dangerous is outlawed- for exam-
ple, in a region where followers of Shar hold authority 
and power, the worship of her good twin and nemesis 
Selilne might be against the law. 
DRAGO NB ORN 
Draconic humanoids from another world, the dragon-
born of Faeriln are proud, honorable, and relatively rare. 
Slaves to dragons on their world of origin, they are now 
a free people looking for a place and purpose in their 
new world. 
UNCERTAIN ORIGINS 
As with all stories of the ancient past, tales of the origins 
of the dragon born are hazy and sometimes contradic-
tory. Each reveals something about the dragonborn in 
its telling, however. 
One story relates that the dragonborn were shaped by 
the ancient dragon-god Io at the same time that Io cre-
ated the dragons. In the beginning of days, Io fused bril-
liant astral spirits with the unchecked fury of the ele-
ments. The greater spirits became dragons- creatures 
so powerful, proud, and willful that they were lords of 
the newborn world. The lesser spirits became the drag-
onborn. Although smaller in stature, they were no less 
draconic in nature. This tale stresses the close kinship 
between dragons and dragonborn, while reinforcing 
the natural order of things- dragons rule and dragon-
born serve, at least according to the dragonborn's for-
mer masters. 
Another legend asserts that Io created the dragons 
at the birth of the world, but dragonborn did not yet 
exist. Then, during the Dawn War, Io was killed by the 
primordial known as Erek-Hus, the King of Terror. With 
a rough-hewn axe of adamantine, the behemoth split Io 
from head to tail, cleaving the dragon-god into two equal 
halves, which rose up as new gods- Bahamut and Tia-
mat. Droplets of Io's blood, spattered across the world, 
became the first dragonborn. For some who believe it, 
this origin story supports the view that dragonborn are 
clearly inferior to the dragons that were made by Io's lov-
ing hand, while others emphasize that the dragonborn 
arose from Io's own blood- just as two draconic deities 
arose from the god's severed body. So are the dragon-
born not, therefore, like the gods themselves? 
A third origin story posits that dragonborn were the 
firstborn of the world, created by Io before the existence
