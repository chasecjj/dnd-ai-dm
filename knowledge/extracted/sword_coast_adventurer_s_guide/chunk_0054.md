The rise of a dwarven city so close to the coastal 
powers of Neverwinter and Waterdeep brings about its 
own special opportunities and concerns. Surely, once 
they get their forges going properly, the dwarves will sell 
armor and weapons similar to the excellent pieces they 
forged in the eastern cities of Old Delzoun, and this mer-
chandise may lessen the demand for goods from more 
distant dwarven settlements. In particular, Sundabar is 
worried that its weapons will no longer be sought after 
along the Sword Coast, and is looking southward for 
new markets in Elturgard and elsewhere. 
Beyond the great mithral doors of the city lies the 
great Iron Tabernacle, the holy center of Gauntlgrym, 
which the priests of all the Morndinsamman are metic-
ulously restoring to honor the gods. Every portion of the 
city has a road or passageway that eventually leads back 
to this site, a vast cavern of crisscrossing walkways and 
great stairs. In its lowest levels, the Tabernacle holds the 
resting places of countless of Gauntlgrym's dead. Schol-
ars have set about cataloging the lineages recorded 
here, to give King Bruenor a more complete picture of 
the bloodlines of the city, and to determine whether any 
of the living clans have relations or honored dead among 
those interred. 
Deeper still is the Great Forge of Gauntlgrym, where 
in times past hammers rang off adamantine anvils to 
forge wonders from every conceivable type of metal. 
Now the forge might be brought back to life again, and 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
soon- the priests and spellcasters of the city are work-
ing on a means of containing the great heat emanating 
from the Fiery Pit where the being of pure flame is con-
tained, to harness the unquenchable fire as the dwarves 
of old did. 
lRONMASTER 
I've never set foot in Ironmaster myself, but I fought 
beside Starn Skulldark, a young warrior-priest of 
Clangeddin who was taking a sort of "vacation" from it 
in order to help reclaim Gauntlgrym. His descriptions 
of life in Ironmaster confirm much of what I've heard 
of the place, and so what I relate to you now is truth as 
solid as Moradin's anvil. 
The dwarves of Ironmaster don't want you there, and 
they want little from the wider world that their traders 
can't bring back for them. Approaches to the vale in 
which their city lies are clearly marked with the symbol 
of Ironmaster: an anvil on a diamond. Such a mark is 
your only warning, and those ignorant of its meaning 
court death at the hands of dwarf patrols that will attack 
any interlopers. Some innocents have been spared and 
turned back, but no one should rely on the mercy of a 
dwarf of Ironmaster.

If you were to pass beyond the borders and into 
Ironm1;1ster itself, you would behold one of the won-
ders of the world. The great Shaengarne river rushes 
through a deep canyon of rock and ice in a series of 
cascades and waterfalls, throwing up freezing froth as 
it bashes against massive spires of rock that rise from 
the riverbed. Ironmaster is built in these spires and 
into the walls of the canyon, the tunnels and towers 
strung together by high bridges and cliff-side walkways. 
To hear Storn talk of the place, you would think that 
dwarves scrabbling about at such heights through the 
open air was as normal as badgers in a burrow, but I 
don't mind saying I set aside my ale after he spoke of it. 
Ironmaster owes its existence to the restlessness of 
Ilgostrogue Sstar, who left Citadel Adbar long ago with 
nearly a quarter of the population of the North kingdom, 
headed for what is now Mirabar. By all accounts he was 
mad, and hoped to extend a dwarven empire to the sea. 
Once there, and settled, he grew restless again, and 
headed farther west with his troop, finally settling his 
nerves in sight of the sea over the Shaengarne River. 
There the dwarf leader died, and his heir demanded that 
the folk that followed him build a settlement in tribute 
to Clanmaster Sstar's grand vision of a dwarven empire. 
The dwarves found extensive deposits of iron in the 
hills surrounding their valley, and so named their city 
Ironmaster. 
Ironmaster proved true to its name, and the dwarves 
have been tunneling out under to tundra for centuries, 
following the veins of metal. This brought them into 
contact with duergar of the Deepkingdom a generation 
back, and Ironmaster has been at war with them ever 
since. Storn was himself a veteran of many battles for 
tunnel territory, and despite being so young that not 
a hair of his beard was white, his knowledge of tun-
nel-fighting tactics rivaled my own. 
Their war with the duergar isn't Ironmaster's only 
secret, however. My friend Storn wielded two silvered 
axes, as befits any devote follower of Clangeddin Silver-
beard, but when I returned to him an axe he had thrown 
in the heat of battle, I noted its remarkable weight, and 
Storn told me that the blade was not steel beneath, but 
adamantine. I questioned him more about this, and 
his readiness to tell me of its origin speaks to both 
the abundance of adamantine among the Ironmaster 
dwarves and of my friend's innocence about the wider 
world. Apparently, the dragon-worshiping humans of the 
distant island of Tuern have long given raw adamantite 
mined from their island to the smiths of Ironmaster, 
and they render finished works of adamantine back to 
the Northlanders in return. Of course, not all the ada-
mantine makes it back to the Northlanders, but since 
the humans are ignorant of the means of forging ada-
mantine, they are likely none the wiser. What a trove of 
arms and armor must lie hidden beyond Ironmaster's 
borders! Ah well, surely they put it to good use against 
the duergar. 
I don't think Storn will mind my sharing his city's 
secrets. You can go and ask him if you like. He'll no 
doubt enjoy another little "vacation" from the war in 
the tunnels. 
MITHRAL HALL 
The ancestral home of Clan Battlehammer, Mithra! 
Hall was a place of great potential wealth when it was 
founded in the days of Old Delzoun. Dwarves of Clan 
Battlehammer left Citadel Adbar, heading west in the 
hope of finding mithral deposits hidden in the south-
ern spurs of the Spine of the World. These they found, 
and so began the delving of Mithra! Hall, with Clan 
Ironshield founding Settlestone nearby as a means of 
buffering the market for the products of the hall's ore. 
Mithra! Hall enjoyed centuries of profit before its delv-
ing permitted the shadow dragon, Shimmergloom, to 
break through into the world. A settlement of thousands 
was reduced to fewer than three hundred- all of them 
too young, too old, too weak, or too ill to fight- who fled 
to Settlestone. There, they waited for months for word 
from King Garumn that their lands were again safe. 
When messengers to the city didn't return, it was clear 
that Mithra! Hall had been lost, and its dwarves headed 
north, first to Ironmaster, where they were treated with 
such distrust that they couldn't remain, and then to 
Icewind Dale. 
When Garumn's grandson, Bruenor, was old enough, 
and sure of his path, he gathered allies to retake his 
former homeland, and went on a great many adven-
tures with the group later known as the Companions 
of the Hall. At the end, Bruenor slew the dragon 
Shimmergloom and reclaimed Mithra! Hall for Clan 
Battlehammer after almost two centuries. 
After Bruenor regained the throne, his personal friends 
attracted some powerful enemies to Mithra! Hall, includ-
ing the drow of Menzoberranzan. This is one reason, his 
supporters claim, that the king abdicated in favor of his 
ancestor Gandalug Battlehammer: to protect the people 
from his personal enemies. Some of Bruenor's detractors 
claim it was wanderlust that made him leave, but none 
will bother (or dare) to ask him. In any case, when Ganda-
lug died, Bruenor did his duty and resumed the throne. 
Before Bruenor died, he was instrumental in gaining 
dwarven support for the Treaty of Garumn's Gorge, 
which brought peace between the dwarves and the 
ore Kingdom of Many-Arrows. When the ores, in time, 
broke their treaty and made war on the North, he 
returned from the dead almost as though he had been 
summoned to rally the dwarves to defend themselves 
and punish their enemies. Some say he delayed receiv-
ing the rewards of Moradin's own Dwarfhome to return 
and aid his fellows and kinsfolk. Such sacrifice, such 
loyalty, makes a dwarf king worthy of the crown. 
Bruenor Battlehammer, the Eighth and Tenth and 
Thirteen King of Mithra! Hall, no longer leads Mithra! 
Hall or the Battlehammer dwarves that live there. 
Since his return to life, he has refocused his attention 
on Gauntlgrym, and doesn't claim the kingship of his 
former home. Instead, the crown has been offered to 
General Dagnabbet Waybeard, granddaughter of Brue-
nor's ally, the great general Dagna. 
When last I visited Mithra! Hall a few years ago, I 
passed through the rebuilt ruin of Settlestone, where a 
garrison of two hundred stands to protect the approach 
to the Mithra! Hall. Once I reached the gates, the
