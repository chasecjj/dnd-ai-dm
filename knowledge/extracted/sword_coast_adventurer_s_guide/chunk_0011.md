and warred upon each other. Those were the Days 
of Thunder. 
The age of the creator races came to a sudden end 
some thirty thousand years ago. Perhaps their wars 
reached a terrible and inevitable crescendo, or they tam-
pered with forbidden forces. For whatever reason, the 
world changed, and their vast empires vanished. All that 
remains of them are ruins and the scattered lizardfolk, 
bullywug, and aarakocra tribes, barbaric descendants of 
those who once ruled the world. 
THE FIRST FLOWERING 
From the ruins of the Days of Thunder arose the first 
nations of the Proud People- the elves and dwarves- in 
the region. 
The elves raised up the nations of Aryvandaar, 
Ardeep, and Ilythiir. They settled Illefarn along the 
Sword Coast, from the Spine of the World to the River 
Delimbiyr- its capitol Aelinthaldaar in the shadow of 
what is now Mount Waterdeep. Wood elves and moon 
elves founded the kingdom of Eaerlann in the Delimbiyr 
Valley and the High Forest, and separatists from Ary-
vandaar settled Miyeritar in the lands of the present-day 
High Moor and Misty Forest. 
The dwarf clans united as the nation of Delzoun, 
named for its forge-founder, with dwarfholds built on 
sites ranging from the Ice Mountains to the Nether 
Mountains and the Narrow Sea, and settlements and 
halls westward to the Crags and the Sword Mountains. 
The Proud People regularly defended their homelands 
against ore hordes that arose from the mountains of 
the Spine of the World and surged southward to attack 
and pillage. 
THE FIRST SUNDERING 
Thousands of years after the rise of the great elven 
nations, hundreds of elf high mages united to cast a 
spell intended to create a glorious homeland for their 
race. The spell succeeded, but it rippled backward and 
forward in time, and the land was sundered, changing 
the face of the world. The largest continent of this new 
world is now called Faert1n. Far from its western shores 
rose the isle of Evermeet, considered a part of Arvandor, 
the home of the elven gods on the plane of Arborea, and 
a bridge between worlds. 
THE C ROWN WARS 
Some thirteen thousand years ago, war broke out be-
tween the elven nations of Aryvandaar and Miyeritar, 
beginning a series of conflicts known as the Crown 
Wars. Lasting some three thousand years, these con-
flicts culminated in the Dark Disaster, in which terrible 
storms engulfed Miyeritar, turning it into a wasteland 
within a single season, leaving behind the area now 
known as the High Moor. The high mages of Aryvan-
daar are blamed for the destruction, although no proof 
was ever produced. 
The vengeful dark elves of Ilythiir turned to corrupt 
and demonic powers, unleashing them against Aryvan-
daar. In the centuries of destruction that followed, elf 
priests and high mages fervently prayed to Corellon Lar-
ethian and the gods of the elven pantheon for salvation. 
THE DESCENT OF THE DROW 
Corellon interceded in the Crown Wars and cursed the 
dark elves so that they might never dwell comfortably 
under the sun. Now finding themselves pained by ex-
posure to daylight, the drow-in a mere two months' 
time- retreated from the sunlit lands of the World Above 
into the Underdark. They abandoned all loyalty to the 
elven gods who betrayed and banished them, turning 
instead to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders, as their 
patron. Wars soon began between the drow and the un-
derground cities of the dwarves. 
THE AGE OF HUMANITY 
For millennia following the end of the Crown Wars, hu-
mans spread and settled throughout Faert1n as the elven 
and dwarven nations stagnated and then began a long, 
slow decline. Deep in the Underdark, the drow fought 
wars of survival and conquest in their new domain. 
THE RISE AND FALL OF NETHERIL 
More than five thousand years ago, a group of human 
fishing villages on the shores of the Narrow Sea joined 
under the rule of the shaman-king Nether, becoming 
known as the empire of Netheril. The Netherese learned 
the use of magic from the Eaerlanni elves and became 
renowned wizards. Centuries later, they discovered the 
arcane texts known as the Nether Scrolls in the ruins of 
Aryvandaar and subsequently abandoned the practices 
of the Eaerlanni in order to procure even greater mag-
ical power. 
Netheril grew to become an invincible nation of magic 
and wonders, dominating much of the North for three 
thousand years. Then the power-mad Netherese arcan-
ist Karsus attempted to usurp the role of the goddess of 
magic. The resulting disruption in the fabric of magic 
sent Netheril's floating cities crashing to the ground, 
destroyed a host of other wards and enchantments, and 
brought about the end of the great empire. 
THE GREAT CITIES 
In the decades and centuries following the collapse of 
Netheril, many cities of the Sword Coast and the North, 
such as Illusk and Citadel Sundbarr, took in refugees 
from the fallen empire, and new settlements made up 
entirely or primarily of human survivors from Netheril 
and their descendants were established throughout the 
North and in the Western Heartlands. 
Nearly fifteen hundred years ago, the human settlers 
of the Dalelands and the elves of Cormanthor pledged 
their alliance in an agreement known as the Dales 
Compact. A monument called the Standing Stone 
was erected to mark the occasion, and the advent of 
Dalereckoning was decreed, beginning with the year 1 
DR. This method of numbering the years in Toril's his-
tory has spread across Faert1n and is commonly under-
stood (if not universally accepted). 
The city of Neverwinter- called Eigersstor when it 
was a mere settlement-was founded in 87 DR. On the 
banks of the River Raurin, the humble community of 
Silverymoon Ford came into being in 384 DR, and less 
than two centuries later it had grown to become the city 
of Silverymoon.
