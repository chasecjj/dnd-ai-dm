that left-handedness is more often associated with great 
artistic ability and the belief that the greatest art comes 
from the ~ccept a nce of truth. 
MYRKUL 
The Lord of Bones, Old Lord Skull, the Reaper 
Myrkul is an ancient god, one of three former mortals 
who were raised to deityhood whenJergal grew weary of 
his divine duties and distributed his influence between 
them. Myrkul became the god of death and the dead, 
and ruled over the City of the Dead for centuries until 
he, in turn, was slain. In time Myrkul returned, for can 
death itself truly ever die? Myrkul's faithful see him as 
the Reaper, who lays claim to souls and brings them to 
Kelemvor to be judged. 
Myrkul is a deity of death, decay, old age, exhaustion, 
dusk, and autumn. He's the god of the ending of things 
and hopelessness, as much as Lathander is the god of 
beginnings and hope. Folk don't pray to Myrkul so much 
as dread him and blame him for aching bones and fading 
vision. Myrkul is thought to be passionless and uncaring 
even of his most devout worshipers. Those who take 
Myrkul as a patron tend to be morose, taciturn, and ob-
sessed with the dead and the undead. Like many follow-
ers ofKelemvor andJergal, priests ofMyrkul serve as un-
dertakers and typically keep their patron's identity secret. 
Shrines to Myrkul or engravings of his holy symbol 
appear in many places where humans bury their dead, 
but full-fledged temples are rare. The few that exist are 
hallowed places where the dead from hundreds of miles 
around are brought for internment, even if they were not 
of Myrkul's faith. There is little space set aside for the 
living in such a location, usually a single modest shrine, 
but its catacombs and ossuaries are vast. In the deepest 
chamber of each temple rests a throne, and upon that 
throne sits the doomwarden- the preserved corpse 
of the most revered saint in the history of the temple 
(often its founder). Initiates to the faith are brought to 
kneel before a temple's doomwarden, where they must 
spend a night and a day fasting and meditating in com-
plete darkness. 
MYSTRA 
The Lady of Mysteries, Our Lady of Spells, the Mother 
of All Magic 
Mystra is the goddess of magic, and with that the god-
dess of possibilities. She is venerated by mages and by 
those who use magic or magical objects in their daily 
lives. She also receives the prayers of those who find 
magic wondrous or encounter magic they fear. Mystra is 
the goddess of the essential force that makes all spell-
casting possible. She provides and tends the Weave, the 
conduit through which mortal spellcasters and magical 
crafters can safely access the raw force of magic. 
The faith of Mystra is pervasive in FaerOn, which is to 
be expected for a land as touched by magic as it is. Her 
worshipers include those who use magic or work closely 
with it, such as alchemists and sages. The blue-clad 
priests of Mystran temples count wizards and sorcerers 
among their numbers, as well as the occasional bard. 
The goal of Mystra's faithful is simple: that magic be 
preserved and promulgated throughout the Realms. 
It isn't unusual for her followers to keep an eye out for 
those who demonstrate high potential for using magic 
and help arrange for such persons to find tutelage with a 
suitable mentor. 
OGHMA 
The Binder, the Lord of Knowledge 
Oghma is the god of inspiration, invention, and knowl-
edge. Above all else, Oghma represents knowledge 
in its most supreme, raw form- the idea. An aphorism 
cited by his faithful about this concept serves them as 
a prayer when it is repeated aloud: "An idea has no heft 
but it can move mountains. An idea has no authority 
but it can dominate people. An idea has no strength but 
it can push aside empires. Knowledge is the greatest 
tool of the mortal mind, outweighing anything made by 
mortal hands. Before anything else can exist, the idea 
must exist." 
Oghma's faithful spread knowledge and literacy as 
widely as possible, believing that minds ought never to 
be shackled by ignorance and thus not be able to be-
queath the benefit they might otherwise provide their 
fellows. Not surprisingly, those who follow Oghma op-
pose those who foster deceit, trickery, and ignorance. 
Folk of many professions favor the Binder: wizards, 
cartographers, artists, bards, clerks, inventors, sages, 
scribes, and all manner of others who uncover, pre-
serve, and create knowledge and learning. The worship 
of Oghma was, at one point, one of the few organized 
faiths in FaerOn that had an established orthodoxy and 
a complete network of temples that adhered to that or-
thodoxy. Schisms during the Time of Troubles shattered 
that network, and now the structures that house the
