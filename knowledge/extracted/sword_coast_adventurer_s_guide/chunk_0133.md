SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 
Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player's 
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, 
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your 
identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the 
words "faith" and "faction" to be interchangeable.) 
Your bond might be associated with other members of 
your faction, or a location or an object that is important 
to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in 
keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, 
but might be more personal in nature. 
FAR TRAVELER 
Almost all of the common people and other folk that one 
might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North 
have one thing in common: they live out their lives with-
out ever traveling more than a few miles from where 
they were born. 
You aren't one of those folk. 
You are from a distant place, one so remote that few 
of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, 
and chances are good that even if some people you meet 
have heard of your homeland, they know merely the 
CH APTER 5 I BACKGROUNDS 
name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have 
come to this part of Faerun for your own reasons, which 
you might or might not choose to share. 
Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's 
ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be 
sure that some things its people take for granted will be 
to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on be-
fore. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for 
good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.

WHY ARE You HERE? 
A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one 
of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or 
her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. 
To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the 
table below or choose from the options provided. The 
following section, discussing possible homelands, in-
cludes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for 
each location.

WHERE ARE You FROM? 
The most important decision in creating a far traveler 
background is determining your homeland. The places 
discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the 
North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this 
background. 
Evermeet. The fabled elven islands far to the west are 
home to elves who have never been to Faerun. They of-
ten find it a harsher place than they expected when they 
do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical 
(though not mandatory) choice for your homeland. 
Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either 
exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of 
elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerun for a pur-
pose that benefits elven culture or society. 
Halruaa. Located on the southern edges of the Shin-
ing South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, 
the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most 
in Faerun who know about it. Many folk have heard 
of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few 
know of the tales that even the least of their people can 
work magic. 
Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerun 
for personal reasons, since their government has a strict
