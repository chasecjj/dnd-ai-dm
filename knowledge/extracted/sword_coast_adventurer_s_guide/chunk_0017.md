Shrines tend to be unstaffed, kept up by the locals and 
visitors who use the place for prayer. A shrine might be 
as modest as a roadside well, where traveling merchants 
can drop a coin to request good fortune from Waukeen, 
or as grand as a statue of Amaunator surrounded by bra-
ziers in a pavilion in the middle of a village. 
Traveling priests often seek out and visit these sites, 
and they act as meeting places for the faithful. When 
word gets around that a traveling priest of Elda th has 
come into town, the faithful seek her out at the holy 
spring dedicated to the goddess at the edge of town. 
A family or business might maintain a shrine or a 
chapel to its favored deity, perhaps a set of wind chimes 
consecrated to Akadi hung from the high branches of 
a tree in the garden, or a wooden symbol shaped like 
the hand of Azuth in miniature displayed on a prom-
inent wall with a space nearby to burn a candle or 
some incense. 
COMMUNING WITH THE GODS 
Though many tales are told of times past when the gods 
appeared in physical form and walked the land, occa-
sions of that sort are few and far between. For the most 
part, the gods communicate with their faithful through 
signs and omens, appreciated by those able to interpret 
them. Of course, some signs are more subtle- and thus 
more open to interpretation- than others. 
The most common kind of communion that worship-
ers and priests find with their deities is in prayer, song, 
or meditation. Such experiences are intensely personal, 
and it is common wisdom to keep them that way. After 
all, "advice" from one's god that appears during morning 
prayer and gives one a good turn to the day is worth-
while only for oneself. Let each worshiper commune in 
their own way, as the saying goes. 
Divine magic also provides a means of communing 
with the gods and can be used to call upon their guid-
ance. Divine pronouncements of this sort are often 
personal in scope and brief, and those edicts that con-
cern broader matters tend to be open to interpretation 
or debate.

PRIESTHOOD 
Priesthood is a vocation like any other, with those who 
undertake it often honing their abilities through a sys-
tem of apprenticeship. At a small temple, a novice or 
an acolyte might study under the only priest available. 
Larger temples can accommodate groups of acolytes, 
each learning under the direction of one or more men-
tors responsible for training them in the duties and 
skills of the priesthood. 
Once acolytes complete their education, they are often 
ordained in a ritual in which a successful candidate is 
invested with the responsibilities of the priesthood. 
CONFLICTS AND PERSECUTION 
The moral and ethical values of the deities in FaerO.n 
run the gamut, representing all the outlooks that their 
mortal followers demonstrate, from the principled 
agents of good to the vicious proponents of evil. Most 
cultures and societies aren't nearly as cosmopolitan as 
the population of FaerO.n taken as a whole; as a result, 
religious persecution (from the viewpoint of those who 
garner the attention) is practiced in places where wor-
ship of certain deities is frowned on. 
Most governments that engage in persecution limit 
such restrictions to the establishment of formal temples, 
priesthoods, and organized festivals. (On a practical 
level, it's impossible to prevent individuals from innoc-
uously or secretly worshiping whichever deities they 
choose.) For instance, although worship of Talona- like 
that of many evil gods- is forbidden in Waterdeep, this 
prohibition extends only to the creation of a temple and 
the presence of her priesthood within the city. Individual 
citizens or families who revere Talona might be viewed 
as misguided, but they aren't taken into custody or pun-
ished as long as they obey the laws of the city. 
Some places take this form of persecution a step 
further, for a variety of reasons. A tyrant might outlaw 
worship of Torm, lest it inspire rebellion, and an other-
wise fair-minded mayor of a river-mill community might 
demand that worshipers of Silvanus find elsewhere to
