PALADIN 
The Oath of the Crown can represent a wide variety of 
paladins associated with various knightly orders across 
the Flanaess. The Knights of the Hart are the perfect 
faction for this type of paladin. In addition, paladins as-
sociated with the Great Kingdom likely take this oath. 
ROGUE 
The City of Greyhawk is known as the City of Thieves 
for good reason. Its thieves' guild exerts power across 
the world. Nestled at the center of the Flanaess's eco-
nomic network, the guild and the city it rules has a hand 
in almost every business deal across the region. 
The Mastermind archetype is the perfect way to rep-
resent an ambitious member of Greyhawk's thieves' 
guild. Willing to take a personal risk on a job but more 
comfortable directing muscle, this flavor of rogue is a 
great match for a character who wants to follow in the 
footsteps of Nerof Gasgol and rise to political and eco-
nomic power. 
Rakes and bravos are common throughout the cities 
of the Flanaess. A Swashbuckler can thus originate 
from almost any city, but among the Rhennee in partic-
ular, Swashbucklers are common. As travelers along 
waterways, they have learned that a quick, mobile ap-
proach to combat works best. 
WARLOCK 
Warlocks are relatively rare in Greyhawk, but as Iuz 
has ascended to power, he has begun to offer power 
directly to those who choose to serve him. Some of the 
other mysterious powers of Oerth, most notably Vecna 
and Tharizdun, also offer pacts to warlocks who dare 
contact them. 
Both Iuz and Vecna fit the Undying patron's role. Iuz, 
in particular, uses offers of power to corrupt and subvert 
folk among his enemies. He offers easy bargains and 
great power to those in the realms of Furyondy and Ve-
luna who are willing to subvert those states from within. 
Some warlocks relish their role as turncoats, a few oth-
ers turn against Iuz, and still others take his power and 
use it to their own ends. 
WIZARD 
Bladesingers form an elite cadre of warrior-mages in the 
kingdom of Celene. Some of these agents work beyond 
Celene's borders, wielding blade and magic against the 
queen's enemies. The art of the blade song is unknown 
beyond that kingdom; no non-elf has learned its secrets. 
HOMEMADE WORLDS 
Running your campaign in a world of your own cre-
ation? Here are tips for introducing some of this book's 
character options to your world, skipping options that 
have obvious applications in a world. 
BARBARIAN 
The Path of the Battlerager is somewhat difficult to 
incorporate into a setting because of its idiosyncratic 
nature. It provides a good match for pit fighters, ber-
serkers, and gladiators. Its reliance on armor provides a 
good cultural touchstone for dwarf characters, as befits 
its role in the Realms. Alternatively, you could use the 
battlerager as the basis for a militant religious order in 
your world, especially one focused on cruelty or fury. 
For the tiger and elk totems, conversion is simply a 
matter of replacing them with more suitable animals (if 
necessary). 
CLERIC 
The concept of a goddess of magic is important to the 
Realms. If your campaign lacks a deity concerned with 
magic, the Arcana Domain works well for religious 
orders charged with hunting down or policing arcane 
spellcasters. If your world strikes a conflict between ar-
cane and divine magic, this domain provides the divine 
faction's mage hunters. 
FIGHTER 
The Purple Dragon Knight captures the essence of a 
bold battlefield strategist. It provides a framework for a 
mercenary captain, a member of an elite order of war-
riors, or a noble charged with leading vassals into battle. 
MONK 
You've probably noticed that the Way of the Long Death 
and the Way of the Sun Soul are both handy tools for 
modeling monastic orders at opposite ends of the align-
ment spectrum. A particularly sinister order is a good 
match for the Long Death, while a heroic order follows 
the Way of the Sun Soul. 
PALADIN 
The Oath of the Crown's utility for your campaign comes 
from its ability to capture neutral paladins, those whose 
code of conduct is focused on the law rather than on 
moral principles. Its divine spellcasting makes it tricky 
to use as a tool for every knightly order, but it's a great 
option for a theocracy. You could also decide that the 
spells a paladin casts aren't divine in origin, but arcane. 
SORCERER 
Storm Sorcery is a good match for an arcane order sup-
ported by a powerful seagoing culture. These sorcerers 
might form an elite cadre of sea captains, helping a king-
dom dominate the sea through trade or raiding. 
WARLOCK 
The Undying patron is a great option for the agents of a 
powerful lich king, necromancer, or other undead ruler. 
These warlocks are also useful for portraying any cult 
or organization focused on a powerful, undead figure 
from your campaign's past. 
WIZARD 
The bladesinger's flavor makes it more than just a war-
rior/mage in the Forgotten Realms. In your campaign, 
consider using it to model an order of elf knights or an 
elite group of warriors trained to protect the rulers of a 
magocracy.
