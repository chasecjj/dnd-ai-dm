is given credit. When one hears three rolls of thunder 
in succession, it is thought to be a sign from Hoar that 
some act of.vengeance has been performed. Many 
human societies have the custom of ringing a bell or a 
gong three times when judgment of a crime is rendered 
or an execution takes place. 
Folk speak Hoar's name when they want revenge, 
particularly when they are incapable of avenging them-
selves. This invocation might be in response to a petty 
slight or a true injustice, and the acknowledgment of 
Hoar might be a short prayer said aloud or might be 
written down somewhere. It's generally believed that 
the more permanent the form of the prayer, the more 
likely it is to be fulfilled. For this reason, some etch 
their prayers in lead and bury it or hide their prayers 
inside diaries. Aside from bounty hunters and those on 
crusades of vengeance, few truly revere Hoar, and he is 
served by fewer still who would call themselves priests. 
Temples or shrines of Hoar are almost nonexistent ex-
cept for ancient sites in Chessenta and Unther. 
Hoar became a member of the Faerfinian pantheon 
when his worship extended beyond the lands that origi-
nally revered him. Most consider Tyr to be the arbiter of 
laws, and Hoar to be the god who metes out punishment 
that comes as a result of breaking those codes. A judge 
might favor the worship of Tyr, while a jail or or a heads-
man is more likely to pray to Hoar. 
lLMATER 
The Crying God, the Rack-Broken Lord, He Who 
Endures 
Ilmater is the god of suffering, martyrdom, and perse-
verance, renowned for his compassion and endurance. 
It is he who offers succor and calming words to those 
who are in pain, victimized, or in great need. He is the 
willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another 
to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is 
the god of the oppressed and the unjustly treated. 
It is said that if he had his way, the Crying God would 
take all the suffering in the world onto himself, so as to 
spare others. Since he can't, he blesses those who endure 
on others' behalf, and he alleviates suffering when he can. 
Martyrs who die that others may live are always blessed 
by II mater with a final rest and reward in the god's after-
life, should they so choose. 
Ilmater's priests take in the ill, the starving, and the 
injured, and his temples give most of what they receive 
to help offset the suffering of the world. His followers

provide succor when they can, but also use force to 
put an end to torture and suffering inflicted on others. 
Ilmater's priests travel to places where the worst pos-
sible conditions exist, ministering to the needs of the 
oppressed, the deceased, and the poor. They put others 
ahead of themselves, are sharing of all they have, and 
emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the welfare of 
the material body. 
Priests of Ilmater who are on a quest to aid others 
can be recognized by their hair shirts, vests of coarse 
fur worn against the bare skin. It is taboo to harm such 
priests as they go about their duties, such as when they 
administer to the wounded on a battlefield. The taboo is 
so strongly felt among humans that other races respect 
the custom. Even ores and goblinoids will avoid directly 
attacking a peaceful priest of Ilmater, as long as the 
priest administers to their fallen warriors as well. 
Most folk deeply respect the work and the sacrifice 
of Ilmater's faith, and lend aid to such endeavors where 
they can. When a temple of Ilmater sends its faithful to 
help refugees of war or victims of plague, their willing-
ness to sacrifice their own well-being always prompts 
ordinary people to support them, whether they are in-
spired or shamed into action. 
ERG AL 
The Final Scribe, the Pitiless One, the Bleak Seneschal 
Legend has it thatJergal is an ancient deity. The story 
goes that in the time of Netheril he was worshiped as 
the god of death, murder, and strife. Yet with the passing 
of time, he became bored with his position. Then one 
day three mortals, each a powerful adventurer, metJer-
gal in the lands of the dead, determined to destroy him 
and take his power. Instead,Jergal calmly abdicated his 
throne of bones and allowed each of the three mortals to 
take part of his divinity. Thus it was that Bane assumed 
the portfolio of strife, Myrkul the rulership of the dead, 
and Bhaal the portfolio of murder.] ergal lost his former 
stature and became a scribe of the dead. 
Jergal is now seen as an uncaring custodian of the 
dead. He is thought to record the passing of the living 
and to aid Kelemvor in seeing that souls are properly 
bound to their appropriate afterlife. He is rarely ac-
knowledged directly, except for being mentioned at 
funerals and among those who practice the custom of 
writing the name of the deceased on a sheet of parch-
ment and placing it in the corpse's mouth. This rite is
