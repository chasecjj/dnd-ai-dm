massive granite doors proved to be heavily guarded, 
and nearly impossible to open from the outside. Mithra! 
Hall's defenders call themselves the Host of the Hall, a 
disciplined, well-armored cohort that is willing to defend 
the city to the last dwarf. The famed Gutbuster Brigade 
is part of the Host, battleragers who strike fear into any 
enemy intelligent enough to realize whom it is they face. 
Travelers allowed inside the city are housed in upper-
level guest chambers just inside the labyrinth of caverns 
known as the Maze. From there, paths lead down into 
the middle levels of the city, past its various furnaces, 
and onward to either the lower levels and deeper mines 
(where guests aren't permitted) or the undercity (where 
non-dwarf visitors are prohibited). 
Despite its recent reputation and the growing legend 
surrounding its most famous king, Mithra! Hall is 
much more a mine than it is a city. Like most dwarven 
realms, it lost significant numbers to the ores, and saw 
its population further depleted by Bruenor's quest for 
Gauntlgrym and the resulting permanent relocation of 
some of his people. As a result, Mithra! Hall's numbers 
are sorely diminished at present, and it remains to be 
seen whether its fortunes will follow suit. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
SUNDABAR 
Like Mirabar, Sundabar was a dwarven settlement 
atop which a human city was built. Sundabar's recent 
fall should serve as an example to my fellow dwarves 
of what can happen when the balance of power shifts 
toward the surface and into human hands. 
The city is descended from the citadel of Sundbarr, a 
stronghold of Delzoun constructed two thousand years 
ago around a strange volcanic rift that would come to 
be known as the Everfire- a mystical source of endless 
heat for the city's smithies and foundries that allowed 
Sundabar to produce works of great wonder. Sundbarr 
was led by a Forgemaster, the smith most skilled at 
working with the Everfire. When one Forgemeaster died 
or another surpassed his or her ability, leadership of 
Sundbarr changed hands. 
So it was until the fleeing remnants of Ascalhorn 
were pursued to the citadel's doorstep some time later. 
Then the Forgemaster of Sundbarr aided the humans 
in fighting off the demons and other monsters that 
chased them. In recognition of a human saving his life 
during the fight, the Forgemaster permitted the refugees 
to settle on the surface, rather than forcing them to 
depart once the battle was done. The partnership that 
grew between dwarves and humans became renowned 
throughout the North, and the surface city of Sundabar 
was built up into a mighty fortress of commerce. 
However, as the humans flourished above, the dwarf 
population dwindled, and eventually the Forgemaster 
was overtaken in prestige and influence by the Ruling 
Master of Sundabar, who came to speak for the human 
guilds and merchants of the surface city. One such 
ruling master, Helm Dwarf-Friend, was so beloved 
and respected that his descendants were able to crown 
themselves kings, something no dwarf before or since 
has dared to do in Sundabar. 
King Firehelm, Helm's grandson, was the king in Sund-
abar when the city fell to the ore horde. He did not survive. 
Beyond that tragedy, the recent war did horrific damage 
to Sundabar and the humans on the surface. A dragon 
dropped great stones on many of the buildings above, and 
a good portion of the city's outer wall was destroyed. Most 
of Sundabar's military leadership was wiped out when 
the building they were meeting in was crushed. Despite 
the best efforts of Aleina Brightlance of Silverymoon's 
Knights in Silver to organize a defense, and the valiant 
efforts of the Sundabar garrison, ores streamed into the 
city, slaughtering the human population on the surface 
and driving what few defenders remained into the caverns 
below, and from them many fled through the Underdark. 
The dwarves of the undercity barricaded themselves in 
the Everfire caverns, and waited. When the ore warlord 
Hartusk left only a token garrison behind in the city to 
slow pursuers, the dwarves emerged from below and set 
about slaughtering every ore and goblin in Sundabar. 
Sundabar is now a dwarven city in its entirety; the 
human population is gone. Efforts to clear away rubble 
and debris from the attacks are slow, as most dwarves 
remain in the sheltered undercity, and those few who 
have duties on the surface have taken over the buildings
