More formal shrines to Beshaba exist in places where 
folk frequently hope to ward off misfortune. These sites 
tend to be posts or stones painted red with blackened 
antlers attached to them, or a red, triangular wall-
mounted plaque with attached antlers. Both types have 
a stone or bronze bowl where coins can be tossed or 
burnt offerings made. The Red Wizards of Thay com-
monly erect such shrines outside their ritual chambers 
to guard against unfortunate mistakes. 
Few dare to take Beshaba as a patron. The rare cler-
ics of the Maid of Misfortune are those who have been 
deeply affected by great misfortunes and who seek to 
warn others of the essential unfairness of life- or to in-
flict that unfairness upon them. 
BHAAL 
The Lord of Murder 
The folk of Faerfm don't normally pray to or acknowl-
edge Bhaal. He is seen as a deeply evil and destructive 
deity who hungers for death- meaning the death of any 
sentient beings through unlawful means. 
Some people pray to Bhaal when they want to commit 
murder. A person might have good reason to resort to 
murder, such as when one is unable to redress some in-
justice through lawful means. But it's far more common 
for prayers to Bhaal to be uttered by those who seek to 
kill someone out of jealousy, greed, or wrath. It's rare for 
anyone but assassins or compulsive killers to take Bhaal 
as a patron, and clerics who revere Bhaal often qualify 
on both counts. 
Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each 
led by a charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but or-
ganized worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely un-
common. Temples and shrines are similarly rare. Those 
who erect a shrine to Bhaal usually do so to thank him 
for a successful murder. Such shrines typically feature 
a skull or a severed head surrounded by drops of blood 
(often both from the murdered victim). 
CHAUNTEA 
The Great Mother, the Grain Goddess 
Chauntea is goddess of agriculture: sowing and reaping, 
seeding and harvest, breeding and butchery, shearing 
and weaving. In this aspect she is a rural deity rarely 
prayed to behind the walls of a city except by kitchen 
gardeners. But Chauntea is also the Great Mother, a 
goddess of crib, hearth, and home. And as such she is 
SYMBOL O F B HAAL 
THE EARTHMOTHER 
The druids of the Moonshae Isles worship the Earth-
mother, she who is the generative power of the land itself. 
To some mainlanders, the Earthmother is an aspect or 
manifestation of Chauntea, but to the Ffolk, she is simply 
the Earth mother, and always will be. The moonwells of the 
isles are her sacred sites and her windows onto the world. 
See "Druids" in chapter 4 for more information. 
welcomed into all homes at mealtimes and at the birth 
of children, and folk give her thanks whenever they 
experience the pleasure of settling by a fire and feeling 
safe and loved. 
Chauntea's faith is one of nurturing and growth. Agri-
cultural aphorisms and farming parables dot her teach-
ings. Growing and reaping, the eternal cycle, is a com-
mon theme in the faith. Destruction for its own sake, or 
leveling without rebuilding, is anathema to her. 
Temples of Chauntea maintain a great body of lore 
about farming and cultivation. Her priests work closely 
with communities in rural areas, and they are willing to 
roll up their sleeves and dig their hands into the dirt. 
CYR IC 
The Prince of Lies, the Dark Sun 
The worship of Cyric derives directly from the story of 
his ascension to godhood. Cyric was a mortal during the 
Time of Troubles and the key to how that chaotic period 
resolved, but he was also a selfish traitor and a mur-
derer. When he became a god, Cyric continued to work 
various plots of deceit and murder- the most famous of 
which is that, according to legend, Cyric murdered Mys-
tra and thus caused the Spellplague over a century ago. 
Those who don't worship Cyric see him as a god of 
madness, strife, and deceit, although his priests con-
sider such claims to be heresy. Their Prince of Lies 
isn't a twisted madman, but a god of dark majesty who 
proves that, ultimately, all bonds between folk corrupt 
and wither away. 
Cyric's church works openly in Arnn, where the citi-
zens espouse the principles of ambition, self-reliance, 
and "buyer beware." Those who take Cyric as their 
patron tend to be sadists, con artists, power-mad conniv-
ers, and worse. Other folk pray to Cyric when they want 
to do wrong but don't want others to find out about it. 
"The Dark Sun," originally one of Cyric's epithets, has 
become a metaphor for strife in the Realms. "A Dark 
Sun has risen o'er this court" might be spoken as a
