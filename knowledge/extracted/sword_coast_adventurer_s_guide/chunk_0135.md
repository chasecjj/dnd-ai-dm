So long as I have this token from my homeland, I 
can face any adversity in th is strange land. 
The gods of my people are a comfort to me so far 
from home. 
I hold no greater cause than my service to my 
people. 
My freedom is my most precious possession. I' ll 
never let anyone take it from me again. 
I'm fascinated by the beauty and wonder of this 
new land. 
Though I had no choice, I lament having to leave 
my loved one(s) behind. I hope to see them agai n 
one day.

I am secretly (or not so secretly) convinced of the 
superiority of my own cu lture over that of this 
foreign land. 
I pretend not to understand the local language in 
order to avoid interactions I would rather not have. 
I have a weakness for the new intoxicants and other 
pleasures of this land. 
I don't take kindly to some of the actions and 
motivations of the people of this land, because 
these folk are diffe rent from me. 
I consider the adherents of other gods to be deluded 
innocents at best, or ignorant fools at worst. 
I have a weakness for the exotic beauty of the 
people of these lands. 
INHERITOR 
You are the heir to something of great value- not mere 
coin or wealth, but an object that has been entrusted to 
you and you alone. Your inheritance might have come 
directly to you from a member of your family, by right 
of birth, or it could have been left to you by a friend, a 
mentor, a teacher, or someone else important in your 
life. The revelation of your inheritance changed your 
life, and might have set you on the path to adventure, but 
it could also come with many dangers, including those 
who covet your gift and want to take it from you- by 
force, if need be. 
Skill Proficiencies: Survival, plus one from among 
Arcana, History, and Religion 
Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of a gaming set or a 
musical instrument 
Languages: Any one of your choice 
Equipment: Your inheritance, a set of traveler's clothes, 
any items with which you are proficient, and a pouch 
containing 15 gp 
FEATURE: INHERITANCE 
Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from 
among the possibilities in the table below. Work with 
your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is 
your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? 
You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as 
part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your 
inheritance as your character does. 
The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance 
as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more 
about its history or true nature, or confronting you with 
foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you 
from learning what you seek. The DM also determines 
the properties of your inheritance and how they figure 
into the item's history and importance. For instance, the 
object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins 
with a modest ability and increases in potency with the 
passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance 
might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when 
certain conditions are met. 
When you begin your adventuring career, you can 
decide whether to tell your companions about your in-
