speech, and cramped, ink-stained fingers. Wizards 
invoke Azuth when they scribe scrolls, inscribe magic 
circles, attempt to memorize spells, and even when they 
cast spells. Often this acknowledgment comes in the 
form of silently forming Azuth's holy symbol, pointing 
the index finger of the left hand to the sky. For many wiz-
ards, the gesture is so commonplace in their lives that it 
becomes an unconscious habit. 
Temples dedicated to Azuth are scarce, and clerics of 
the deity are extremely rare. Even in magic-saturated 
Halruaa, only a handful of holy places are dedicated to 
Azuth. Sometimes a statue or a shrine dedicated to him 
stands in a corner of a temple to Mystra or another deity. 
More often, a wizard has a personal shrine at home. 
Azuth is represented at such sites as a hooded and 
bearded figure with left hand held high, finger pointed 
up. Sometimes he is represented by merely the hand. In 
either case, the finger often serves as a candleholder or 
as the point of origin for a light spell. 
BANE 
The Black Hand, the Lord of Darkness 
Bane has a simple ethos: the strong have not just the 
right but the duty to rule over the weak. A tyrant who 
is able to seize power must do so, for not only does the 
tyrant benefit, but so do those under the tyrant's rule. 
When a ruler succumbs to decadence, corruption, or de-
crepitude, a stronger and more suitable ruler will rise. 
Bane is vilified in many legends. Throughout history, 
those who favor him have committed dark deeds in his 
name, but most people don't worship Bane out of mal-
ice. Bane represents ambition and control, and those 
who have the former but lack the latter pray to him to 
give them strength. It is said that Bane favors those who 
exhibit drive and courage, and that he aids those who 
seek to become conquerors, carving kingdoms from the 
wilderness, and bringing order to the lawless. 
At many times and in many places in Faen1n, the 
faithful of Bane have been seen as saviors for their ef-
forts in slaughtering raiders, throwing down corrupt rul-
ers, or saving armies on the brink of defeat. But in just 
as many other places, the worship of Bane has created 
or supported cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile mo-
nopolies, or brought about the practice of slavery where 
before it didn't exist.

CHAPTER 1 I WELCOME TO THE REALMS 
BESHABA 
The Maid of Misfortune, Lady Doom, Black Bess 
Beshaba is the counterpoint to Tymora and is just as 
frequently acknowledged in daily life as is her more be-
nevolent "sister." She is seen as a cruel and capricious 
goddess who must be propitiated to avoid attracting her 
attention and interest in a negative way. 
Beshaba's name is invoked when someone is beset by 
bad luck-which could be as minor as stubbing a toe or 
breaking a wagon wheel, or as catastrophic as slipping 
and accidentally falling off a cliff. It is also invoked to 
ward off her attentions when someone is doing some-
thing in which good luck wouldn't play a part but bad 
luck might. For example, someone rolling dice would 
invoke Tymora because they want random chance to 
fall in their favor, but someone about to cross a rickety 
bridge would ask Beshaba to keep the bridge intact. 
Folk make the symbol of Beshaba by folding in their 
thumbs and extending their fingers on one or both 
hands (mimicking the horns of her holy symbol) to ward 
off misfortune. The same gesture raised to the head 
signifies a salute; when pointed at someone, the "horns" 
indicate ill favor directed toward that individual. 
Many druids worship Beshaba as one of the First 
Circle. They propitiate her with dances while wearing 
fire-blackened antlers dipped in blood. According to 
these druids, her holy symbol is the horns of a stag be-
cause when Beshaba was first worshiped, humans were 
simple hunter-gatherers and she was believed to bring 
misfortune to hunters, such as being gored by a stag. 
Although most people tremble in fear at the prospect 
of Beshaba's attendance at any event (even in spirit), 
Beshaba is almost always invoked and welcomed 
formally in the opening speeches or ceremonies of 
formal functions such as marriages and coronations, 
contests of sport or martial prowess, and at the naming 
ceremonies of children. If she isn't invited to such an 
event, she might take offense and wreak misfortune on 
those involved. 
Temples to Beshaba are virtually unknown. It's com-
mon, however, for rural folk to erect a post and mount 
antlers on it at the site of some roadside accident or 
murder. In cities, where antlers are hard to come by and 
murders and accidents more prevalent, the fashion is to 
draw the black antlers of Beshaba with charcoal on a 
nearby wall, leaving the symbol on display until weather 
scours it away. These "shrines," in either form, serve as 
warnings to others about places of ill fortune.
