Gold dwarves have the racial traits of hill dwarves in 
the Player's Handbook. They are stocky and muscular, 
averaging about 4 feet tall, with brown skin, black or 
brown hair, and brown or hazel eyes, with green eyes 
rare (and considered lucky). Males grow full beards that 
they keep oiled and well groomed, and both genders 
wear their hair long and often elaborately braided. 
Gold dwarves are best known for crafting beautiful 
objects. According to them, all the natural resources of 
the world exist for mortals to turn them into objects of 
great beauty. Gold dwarves don't want the most of every-
thing; they want the best. Their artisans toil over items 
for years, getting their etchings and fine details just right 
before being satisfied with their efforts. 
That deliberate, perfectionist approach is a reflec-
tion of gold dwarf culture, in which there is a right and 
proper way to do everything. Tradition dictates every as-
pect of a gold dwarf's life, from one's place in society, to 
prospects for marriage, to what careers are acceptable. 
Gold dwarves who take up a life of adventuring, away 
from the clan, rarely forsake their traditions when doing 
so. Even though they might have to live as outsiders for 
a time, they hope to ultimately improve their standing in 
their society. 
GRAY DWARVES (DUERGAR) 
The gray dwarves, or duergar, live deep in the Un-
derdark. After delving deeper than any other dwarves, 
they were enslaved by mind flayers for eons. Although 
they eventually won their freedom, these grim, ash-
en-skinned dwarves now take slaves of their own and 
are as tyrannical as their former masters. 
CHAPTER 3 I RACES OF THE REALMS 
Physically similar to other dwarves in some ways, du-
ergar are wiry and lean, with black eyes and bald heads, 
with the males growing long, unkempt, gray beards. 
Duergar value toil above all else. Showing emotions 
other than grim determination or wrath is frowned on 
in their culture, but they can sometimes seem joyful 
when at work. They have the typical dwarven apprecia-
tion for order, tradition, and impeccable craftsmanship, 
but their goods are purely utilitarian, disdaining aes-
thetic or artistic value. 
Few duergar become adventurers, fewer still on the 
surface world, because they are a hidebound and sus-
picious race. Those who leave their subterranean cities 
are usually exiles. Check with your Dungeon Master to 
see if you can play a gray dwarf character. 
DUERGAR SUBRACE TRAITS 
The duergar subrace has the dwarf traits in the Player's 
Handbook, plus the subrace traits below. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score in-
creases by 1. 
Superior Darkvision. Your darkvision has a radius 
of 120 feet. 
Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write 
Undercommon. 
Duergar Resilience. You have advantage on saving 
throws against illusions and against being charmed or 
paralyzed. 
Duergar Magic. When you reach 3rd level, you can 
cast the enlarge/reduce spell on yourself once with this 
trait, using only the spell's enlarge option. When you 
reach 5th level, you can cast the invisibility spell on 
yourself once with this trait. You don't need material 
components for either spell, and you can't cast them 
while you're in direct sunlight, although sunlight has no 
effect on them once cast. You regain the ability to cast 
these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest. 
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. 
Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack 
rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever 
you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. 
DWARVEN DEITIES 
The gods of the dwarves are a pantheon, or clan, collec-
tively known as the Morndinsamman. 
FORGE FATHER AND REVERED MOTHER 
Moradin, the Soulforger, leads the dwarven gods. 
Known as Dwarf-father or All-Father, he is the god 
of the dwarf people as a whole, as well as the god of 
creation, "dwarf-crafts" (smithing and stonework), and 
protection. His wife is the Revered Mother, Berronar 
Truesilver, goddess of hearth and home, of honesty and 
faithfulness, and of oaths, loyalty, and honor. 
GODS OF BATTLE 
Clangeddin Silverbeard is the dwarven god of war and 
valor. Gorm Gulthyn, also called Fire Eyes and the Lord 
of the Bronze Mask, is the god of defense and vigilance, 
the protector of dwarves. Haela Brightaxe is the god-
dess of luck in battle, and the patron of dwarf fighters.
