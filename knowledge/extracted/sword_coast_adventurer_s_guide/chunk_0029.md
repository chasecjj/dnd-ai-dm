games. Ordinary folk pray to him to avert his eyes from 
their valuables, but the cautious sometimes employ 
"Mask's purse," a small, cheap cloth pouch worn in plain 
sight (thus easily cut or lifted) containing a small offer-
ing of coin. By convention, a pickpocket pilfers Mask's 
purse when encountering another person wearing one, 
and considers the gain a gift from the god, while the one 
who lost the purse is grateful to the Lord of Shadows for 
accepting a respectful sacrifice of a small portion of his 
goods. Of course, nothing prevents another pickpocket 
from targeting someone who has lost Mask's purse, but 
anyone with the ill luck to attract multiple pickpockets in 
a single outing has probably earned Mask's ire anyway. 
Priests of Mask are usually thieves by profession, and 
often serve as higher-ups in the local underworld or 
criminal syndicate. They go by the title of demarche or 
demarchess, and wear veil-masks when acting in their 
priestly capacity. 
MIELIKKI 
Our Lady of the Forest, the Forest Queen 
People rarely speak of Mielikki except in quiet forest 
spaces. Woodlands that evoke wonder are where she 
reigns supreme, but she is said to keep watch over good 
folk in any forest, not matter how dark or cruel. When 
children are lost in the woods, people beseech Mielikki 
to protect them until they are found. 
Mielikki is the goddess of the forest and the creatures 
that live within it. She is seen as a remote and spiritual 
deity- less human-like than many other gods. She's 
not unmindful of people, but her attention and favor 
are difficult to attract. She is the patron of rangers in 
the same way that Milil is the patron of bards, but even 
rangers rarely pray to her directly. They instead pray to 
Gwaeron Windstrom, who they believe will carry their 
words to the goddess by tracking her to whichever forest 
she hides in. 
Mielikki's symbol is a unicorn, which prompts some to 
think of her as such and conflate her with Lurue, Queen 
of the Unicorns and the actual goddess of their kind. But 
most tales depict Mielikki as a beautiful woman whom 
Lurue allows upon her back as a rider, and the two are 
thought to be boon companions. Mielikki's relationships 
with other deities of the natural world are more com-
plex. Silvanus is sometimes thought of as her father and 
Eldath is considered her sister, but Mielikki walks her 
own path through the wilds.

CHAPTER l I WELCOME TO THE REALMS 
She has many shrines, particularly in the Savage 
Frontier. Most consist of a dead tree trunk into which 
has been carved a likeness of her holy symbol, a uni-
corn's head. Alternatively, the likeness might be carved 
on a separate piece of wood and tacked to a living 
tree. These shrines typically mark the point in a forest 
beyond which locals know not to cut timber or hunt. 
Often these tributes are created by loggers at the end 
of a logging excursion as a mark of thanks to the god-
dess for providing the wood and for keeping the timber 
cutters safe during the work. 
MI LIL 
The Lord of Song, the One True Hand of All-Wise 
Oghma 
Milil is the god of poetry, eloquence, and song. He is 
a god of creativity and inspiration, of the entire song 
more than just the lyrics or the music. He represents 
the finished thought, the result of the process that takes 
an idea from conception to realization. Milil is most 
venerated by bards, troubadours, and other entertain-
ers, but anyone preparing to entertain or speak before 
a crowd might offer Milil a brief prayer for a successful 
performance. Those who seek inspiration in a creative 
endeavor also pray to Milil. 
His icons depict him as a handsome male, sometimes 
a human, sometimes an elf, and even a half-elf in places 
(such as Aglarond) that have a large half-elf population. 
He is variously depicted as young or old, but his identity 
is always apparent because of his five-stringed harp 
made of silvery leaves, which he carries constantly. He 
is the ideal to which all performers aspire: poised and 
confident, winningly charismatic, and a source of in-
spiration for those who listen to him. He is said to have 
total recall of anything he hears or that is spoken while 
music plays, as well as utmost skill at improvisation. 
Holy sites dedicated to Milil are often found in per-
formance venues and schools of music. Whether the 
site is a vast concert hall or a small choral chamber, it 
must have excellent acoustic qualities. Milil's priests 
are patrons of the arts in addition to being performers 
themselves, and they frequently act as tutors in the arts 
of performance at his shrines and temples. 
Like Deneir, Milil is sometimes thought of as being 
in service to Oghma. In these portrayals of the deity, 
Milil is the god's left hand, also referred to as the One 
True Hand. This expression isn't meant to denigrate 
the right hand (Deneir); rather, it stems from the fact
