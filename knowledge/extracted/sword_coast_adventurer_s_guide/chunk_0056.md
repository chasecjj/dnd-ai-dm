with the least damage, scavenging stones from ruined 
structures to reinforce those that can be salvaged. 
Before the war, Sundabar's surface streets were 
cobbled smooth, but many of those roads have been 
destroyed by falling stones, torn up for ammunition or to 
repair walls, or simply neglected. Now, the surface city 
is a hollowed-out ruin. Some believe that the city above 
will be allowed to wither into oblivion, with the excep-
tion of the sturdy double wall that surrounds it (and 
which the dwarves have already repaired). The tem-
ples of human deities stand abandoned. The walls are 
patrolled by a few sharp-eyed sentries, whose duty is to 
report what they see and to turn away unwanted visitors. 
In the center of the upper city, the Circle still stands 
around the ruin of the Master's Hall, ready to receive vis-
iting caravans, livestock, and merchants. However, few 
such visitors arrive, and fewer still are welcomed, as Sund-
abar prefers to engage in trade nowadays only with other 
dwarven cities through the Underdark. Were it within the 
Forgemaster's power, he would see to it that all commerce 
entering and leaving the city do so by means of under-
ground traffic, so that most surface trade routes could be 
abandoned entirely. 
Sundarren trust of outsiders is low, and their assess-
ment of humans lower still. During the war, of all the 
human cities, only Silverymoon made any attempt to aid 
Sundabar, and that aid was (to dwarven minds) far too 
little and too late. As a result, with the Silver Marches 
dissolving, Sundabar wasted no time withdrawing from 
the Lords' Alliance as well, officially severing formal ties 
with the human realms of the North except for those 
necessary for trade. Given that such trade is now a rare 
occurrence, most of the human realms see Sundabar 
as jealously guarding its wealth and cravenly hiding 
beneath the surface, while the rest of the region does 
what it can to recover from the recent conflicts. Sund-
abar's losses in buildings and in population have done 
nothing to diminish the contents of its overflowing cof-
fers, and despite its current state, the city remains one 
of the wealthiest in the North, though most of that coin 
rarely leaves the city now. 
The notion of kingship has come up among the 
dwarves in the undercity, but the Forgemaster has 
rejected the idea. Let the dwarves tend to themselves, 
surely, but there should be no king in Sundabar. I don't 
know whether Flamestoker's reticence is false modesty 
or true wisdom, or if he is waiting for a warrior-king to 
claim Sundabar as part of a larger realm. 
THORNHOLD 
West of the High Road and hard to the coast near the 
Mere of Dead Men lies what humans refer to as Thorn-
hold. Once the keep of a petty warlord of the Margaster 
family of Waterdeep, it was captured and claimed by a 
paladin as part of the Second Troll War. For many years 
the Knights of Samular, an order of Tyrran paladins 
founded by one Samular Caradoon, used Thornhold as 
its base, though the hold remained the personal prop-
erty of the Margaster family. 
For a brief time a little more than a century ago, 
Thornhold fell into Zhentarim hands. When the 
Zhentarim marched through the Underdark to claim 
Thornhold, they passed through the caverns of Clan 
Stoneshaft, which had lived below since before the 
time the surface city was erected by humans. Though 
the Zhentarim killed or enslaved many of the dwarves 
there, they failed to destroy the clan. The survivors soon 
escaped, regrouped, and retook Thornhold by force 
under their leader, Ebenezer Stoneshaft, with the aid of 
Samular's descendant, the Harper Bronywn Caradoon. 
After the fortress was reclaimed, in a gesture of respect 
and gratitude, Caradoon bequeathed its custody to Clan 
Stoneshaft. 
The dwarves of Thornhold are all of the Stoneshaft 
clan, and because tunnels from their home connect to 
the castle, they refer to the place as Stoneshaft Hold; 
they use "Thornhold" only when a non-dwarf in a con-
versation is confused and an explanation must be made. 
By habit and nature, Stoneshaft dwarves are secretive 
(even for dwarves), but nonetheless always eager to 
hear what's afoot in Waterdeep, particularly any doings 
involving the Margaster family, whom they see as 
foes who will one day attack their home to regain it or 
destroy it if they can't take it back. 
To most humans, Thornhold is merely the fortress 
above the surface, a castle of gray stone with a thick, 
curving wall and a two-towered central keep. They don't 
know of the caverns below that lead to the Stoneshaft 
clanhold. The cliff facing the sea is so sheer that no wall 
need be built to protect that side of the hill on which 
Thorn hold sits. The castle is utterly without adornment 
or ornamentation, and only crenellations and arrow 
slits break the solid face of stone. Within the castle, 
surrounding the bailey, are small buildings of wood and 
plaster that hold animals and are used for smithwork, 
candlemaking, laundry, wood repairs (including wagons 
and the like), and brewing beer. 
Long ago, Thornhold was a profitable stopover for car-
avanners, adventurers, and other travelers journeying 
north along the High Road past or through the Mere 
of Dead Men. For decades, the expansion of the Mere 
in the calamities of the Spell plague cut off most travel 
along the High Road. During that time, the Stoneshafts 
lived in relative isolation, stockpiling their ore, refined 
metal, and crafts. Stoneshafts are known for the fine 
metal- and gemwork they craft, considered by most to be 
works of art worn as personal adornment. 
The Margasters ofWaterdeep believe that they still 
have a right to Thornhold. The fortress sits on the rees-
tablished High Road leading to Neverwinter, so it is no 
wonder that the nobles wish to profit from the fortress's 
location along that route. The Knights of Samular also 
show interest in restoring their outpost at Thornhold as 
a prelude to sorties into the Mere, and there is talk that 
these desires may lead to a curious alliance between the 
grasping human nobles and the high-minded paladins. 
Stoneshafts fear the politics of powerful Waterdeep 
will lead to an assault on Thornhold. They have thus 
been preparing for siege by gathering supplies and rein-
forcing Thornhold's defenses. 
Stoneshaft dwarves can taste the wealth, bustling 
energy, and constant excitement of nearby Waterdeep, 
and want to share in it. They don't want to be forced into 
isolationism, and kept away from Waterdhavian society
