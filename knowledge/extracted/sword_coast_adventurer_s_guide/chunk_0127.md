hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 
hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell. 
DEFY DEATH 
Starting at 6th level, you can give yourself vitality when 
you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. 
You can regain hit points equal to ld8 +your Constitu-
tion modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed 
on a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature 
with spare the dying. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a long rest. 
UNDYING NATURE 
Beginning at 10th level, you can hold your breath in-
definitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, 
although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and 
still benefit from finishing short and long rests. 
In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 
years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are 
immune to being magically aged. 
INDESTRUCTIBLE LIFE 
When you reach 14th level, you partake of some of the 
true secrets of the Undying. On your turn, you can use 
a bonus action to regain hit points equal to ld8 +your 
warlock level. Additionally, if you put a severed body 
part of yours back in place when you use this feature, 
the part reattaches. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest. 
WIZARDS 
THE FIRST HILT PARRIED A CLUMSY AXE SWING AND 
caught the rhythm of the wizard's spell. It was one with 
which he was wellfamiliar. Using his free hand, the 
bladesinger mirrored his opponent's casting then sent his 
considerable power out to surround the overmatched 
wizard, binding it to himself. Argent energy flew from the 
human's outstretched hand on(y to fizzle into nothingness 
as the bladesinger quenched the spell. 
- Keith Francis Strohm, Bladesinger 
Scholars and practitioners of what they call "the Art" 
(see chapter 1 for details), wizards are the most disci-
plined spellcasters in the Forgotten Realms. They need 
to be, as their powers come from years of careful study 
and practice. Some wizards apprentice and study with 
an experienced master, while others attend formal acad-
emies or universities of wizardry, such as those in Ever-
meet or Halruaa, or in the great cities of the North like 
Waterdeep or Silverymoon. 
With the intensity of their study and practice, wizards 
tend to become increasingly solitary as they advance in 
their Art, having fewer peers with whom they can share 
their insights, if they choose to share them with anyone 
at all. Thus great wizards often take up residence in iso-
lated towers or strongholds, exhibiting ever more eccen-
tric behavior as time goes on. Some say this is a mark 
CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 
of madness brought on by delving too deeply into arcane 
lore, but they never say it too loudly anywhere a wizard 
might overhear. 
The greatest wizards of the Realms find means of 
extending their lives far beyond the span of any race 
except the elves. Archwizards may be centuries old, hav-
ing seen civilizations rise and fall across Faerun. Other 
wizards seeking this longevity turn to lichdom, dwelling 
in isolated tombs and strongholds as they withdraw 
from the world in body as well as mind. 
WIZARDLY GROUPS 
Many wizardly groups exist in the Forgotten Realms, 
but two, in particular, stand out.
