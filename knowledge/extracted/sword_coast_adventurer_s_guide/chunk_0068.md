often pitch in with hands-on efforts when a particularly 
large chore needs doing. 
The master readers are the sages and elder monks 
who oversee the scribes and teach the acolytes. All 
are possessed of significant experience and dedicated 
to the great library, and it is from this group that indi-
viduals are chosen to fill in the upper ranks when 
positions open up. 
Above the master readers are other high-ranking 
posts, each with specialized duty, from the Gatewarden 
who tends to the security of the keep to the Guide who 
instructs and educates the Avowed. Of particular note 
is the Chanter, who is responsible for continuing the 
ongoing recitation of the prophecies of the great seer 
Alaundo, who once made his home here. 
I remember the first time I came upon the Endless 
Chant. It starts at the edge of one's hearing (I was one of 
the first in the courtyard to sense it), and slowly grows 
closer and louder. As it does so, everything else falls 
silent around you. In short order, a procession of Avowed 
arrive on the scene, and the only sound anyone can per-
ceive is their echoing, sonorous chant. The Chanter or 
one of his subordinates (called "voices") leads this proces-
sion, and each of the Avowed is expected to lend his voice 
to the procession occasionally. 
It was through my friendship with Waldrop that I 
met one of the eight Great Readers, the council of elder 
Avowed who oversee the operation of Candlekeep. She 
was tall, and I remember thinking that she was one of 
the most erudite folk I'd ever spoken with. Each of the 
Great Readers is given an arena of responsibility within 
the Avowed, usually a topic of scholarly importance, and 
acknowledged and treated as the foremost expert in 
that field. 
Finally, above them all are two others: the Keeper of 
Tomes and the First Reader. Where the First Reader's 
focus is maintaining the integrity of Candlekeep's schol-
arship, and ever expanding its literary resources and 
base of knowledge, the Keeper governs the great library. 
The Keeper's word is law, quite literally- each Keeper's 
edicts are recorded for the edification of future Keep-
ers, and all are maintained as ongoing traditions until 
changed by the word of a future Keeper. Waldrop tells 
me that traditionally the Keeper and the First Reader 
are supposed to have an antagonistic relationship, one 
focused on the cloistered monks and the enlightened 
goals of the library and the other on the mundane 
aspects of scholarship and Candlekeep's interactions 
with the outside world. 
Although these high-ranking monks keep most vis-
itors at arm's length, it isn't unknown for them to deal 
with adventurers directly when they need such services. 
While these scholars rarely have much coin to pay for 
the services of a company of venturers, they do possess 
the precious currency of Candlekeep: knowledge. I 
know of many companies who have been shown lore 
concerning lost ruins, then asked to brave some danger-
ous place and return with prizes that can be found only 
in that location. If the treasure that might be found in 
such places isn't enough of a reward, some Avowed are 
empowered to offer inducements such as procedures for 
creating magic items and written copies of rare spells to 
sweeten the deal. 
SERVICES 
Those who come to Candlekeep are permitted to remain 
for one tenday before departing, and must remain away 
for at least a full month before returning. During this 
tenday, they may ask to read specific tomes known to 
be in the possession of the library, or they may ask the 
monks to find them tomes concerning certain topics. 
These works are brought to the reading rooms in the 
towers that face the Court of Air. Guests are permitted 
to ascend into those towers and read (but not copy) the 
tomes there, always in the company of one of the monks. 
One of Candlekeep's main sources of income is the 
sale of books. Three kinds of such books exist: copies 
of tomes of nonmagical lore, copies of spellbooks and 
other magical formulae, and works of the Avowed. 
Copied Lore. The copying and binding of a work of 
nonmagical lore in Candlekeep's library is generally 
performed at a cost of 100 gp or so (though quite large 
books are always more). This manufacture may take 
several weeks, particularly for large tomes, so it isn't 
uncommon for those who desire such a work to commis-
sion it in writing, along with advance payment, and then 
come to the gate to pick up the book, or pay an addi-
tional price to have it delivered. 
Spellbooks. In contrast, magical books of spells and 
formulae cost much, much more-a spellbook might be 
priced at thousands or even tens of thousands of gold 
pieces. Each simple spell or cantrip in such a tome costs 
25 gp or so, with the more complex and powerful spells 
fetching 150 gp or more each. 
Works of the Avowed. Each year, the monks of Can-
dlekeep release a small book stamped with the sigil of 
the keep, and credited to "The Avowed of Candlekeep." 
These books are always focused on singular topics, 
and contain short essays, excerpts, and other writings 
germane to the topic. They are sold at Candlekeep and 
by representatives in large cities for between 50 gp and 
100 gp per book, though some are often resold for a 
great deal more. 
Candlekeep also buys books and even sponsors 
adventurers on expeditions to seek out lost sources of 
lore across the Realms. The exchange of coin in such 
undertakings is, of course, open to the usual sort of 
negotiation. 
DARKHOLD 
I don't suppose you've heard of Darkhold. It's been 
many years since folk whispered the name of the place 
in fear. After all, the Zhentarim, the organization that 
gave Darkhold its evil reputation, are by all accounts no 
longer the cadre of thieves, assassins, and evil wizards 
they once were. And strangely enough, according to my 
source among the Zhentarim, that change in character 
can be traced right back to Darkhold. As it was told to 
me, it came about like this ... 
Zhentil Keep was burning. The Citadel of the Ravens 
lay in ruins. The leadership of the Zhentarim died, were 
captured by the Shadovar of returned Netheril, or were 
in flight. The vaunted Black Network was shredded.
