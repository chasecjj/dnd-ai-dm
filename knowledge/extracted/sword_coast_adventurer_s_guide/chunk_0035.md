THE LEGEND OF TYCHE AND HER TWIN 
DAUGHTERS 
Before the Dawn Cataclysm, there was but one goddess 
of luck, Tyche. Ever flirting with fortune and disaster, Lady 
Luck bestowed and withdrew her favor at a whim. When 
her current paramour, Lathander, started a fight among the 
gods, Tyche kissed the Morninglord with misfortune and 
wandered off to explore the world. 
During her travels, Lady Luck discovered a budding 
rose of unequaled beauty. Delighted with this fortuitous 
happenstance, Tyche reached to pluck this delightful 
token, which she assumed was a peace overture from 
Lathander, who sought to regain her good graces. Much to 
her amazement, Lady Luck couldn't pluck the rose from its 
bush no matter how hard she tried. Frustrated, she cursed 
the rose with bad luck, and the flower's stem broke in her 
hands. Tyche put the plucked rose behind her ear and 
continued on her way. Unknown to Tyche, the rose was a 
manifestation of Moander, god of corruption and decay. 
The severed rose stem crept into Tyche's ear and subtly 
began to rot her from the inside out. 
When Tyche returned home, she came across her dear 
friend , the goddess SelCme, waiting to speak with her. 
Also waiting for her were Lathander, who wished to regain 
her affections, and Azuth, who had come to mediate the 
dispute between the two. Selune wept great tears as she 
saw the corruption destroying her friend from within, and 
before Tyche could discern her intent, Selune lashed out 
with a bolt of purifying light. Tyche's rotted core split down 
the middle and a smaller, brighter version of the goddess 
of luck stepped out, allowing the goddess of the moon to 
save that which was good and pure in her friend. How-
ever, following this first figure out of the rotten shell was 
another form stunning to behold, but full of dark malice 
and capricious ill will. As the two forms emerged, they 
immediately fell upon each other in hate, struggling madly, 
and were separated only by the combined efforts of all 
three visitors. 
It is said that Tymora, Tyche's Fair-Haired Daughter, 
embodies all the grace and kindness of her mother, while 
Beshaba, Tyche's Unpleasant Daughter, got only her looks. 
Since their birth, the twin aspects ofTyche-Tymora, Lady 
Luck, and Beshaba, Maid of Misfortune-have battled 
each other, contesting matters as great as the fate of 
nations and as sma ll as the flip of a coin. 
TYR 
Grimjaws, the Maimed God, the Evenhanded 
wound dealt to him by Ao when he questioned the jus-
tice of the Overgod's actions. 
Tyr's followers devote themselves to the cause of 
justice, to the righting of wrongs and the deliverance of 
vengeance. This devotion isn't necessarily concerned 
with equality or fairness, but rather the discovery of 
truth and the punishment of the guilty. Those who favor 
Tyr tend to be stiff-necked about matters of theology 
and laws, seeing things in terms of black and white. 
Tyr's credo of lawfulness and honesty is a demanding 
one, and his priests remind the faithful not to hold in 
contempt others who can't live by it- it wouldn't be an 
honorable calling if everyone could muster the strength 
of will to follow it. 
Many orders of knighthood are devoted to Tyr, includ-
ing the Knights of Holy Judgment and the Knights of the 
Merciful Sword. Such knights-as well as judges and 
priests, clerics, and paladins who worship Tyr- some-
times wear thin strips of diaphanous cloth over their 
eyes to remind others of the blindness of justice. 
UMBERLEE 
The Bitch Queen, the Queen of the Depths, the 
Wavemother 
No community that lives by the sea can ignore the influ-
ence of Umberlee, the furious goddess whose tempestu-
ous nature reflects and is reflected by the waters of the 
deep. Any such community makes sure to host festivals 
to propitiate the Wavemother and seek her favor. Al-
though mercurial in temperament, she can be generous 
to those who do her honor, as is any great queen. 
The Bitch Queen is worshiped out of fear instead of 
adoration, and ship crews offer her gems, tossed over 
the side, to calm storm-tossed waters. As her most com-
mon moniker suggests, she is viewed as capricious and 
cruel with no firm ethical outlook; the sea is a savage 
place, and those who travel it had best be willing to pay 
the price of challenging her domain. 
There is little in the way of an organized clergy of Um-
berlee. Her priests roam coastal cities, warning of doom 
and demanding free passage on ships in return for en-
suring the goddess's pleasure. Often they wear the col-
ors of waves and storms, and they decorate themselves 
Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Evenhanded, Wounded Tyr, the 
Maimed God, the Blind, Blind Tyr, the Lord ofJustice-
all of these names speak to the nature of the Faerunian 
god of justice. Tyr appears as a noble warrior missing 
his right hand, which he lost to Kezef the Chaos Hound 
in an act of bravery and sacrifice, and with his eyes 
wrapped in cloth to signify his blindness, caused by a ,4
