SORCEROUS ORIGIN 
Sorcerers in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Sorcerous Origin option, in addition to those in the Play-
er's Handbook. 
STORM SORCERY 
Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental 
air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to 
a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but 
perhaps you were born during a howling gale so power-
ful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might 
include the influence of potent air creatures such as 
vaati or djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm 
permeates your being. 
Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship's 
crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over 
wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abili-
ties also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, 
pirates, and other waterborne threats. 
WIND SPEAKER 
The arcane magic you command is infused with ele-
mental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. 
(Knowing this language allows you to understand and 
be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, 
Auran, Ignan, and Terran.) 
TEMPESTUOUS MAGIC 
Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your 
turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly 
surround you, immediately before or after you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up 
to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. 
HEART OF THE STORM 
At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder 
damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell 
of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder 
damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption 
causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 
10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage 
(choose each time this ability activates) equal to half 
your sorcerer level. 
STORM GUIDE 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the 
weather around you. 
If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain 
to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on 
you. You can end this effect as a bonus action. 
If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each 
round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 
100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows 
in that direction until the end of your next turn. This fea-
ture doesn't alter the speed of the wind. 
STORM'S FURY 
Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee at-
tack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage 
to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. 
The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw 
ARCAN E SPELLCASTERS 
The common folk of Faerun often make little distinction 
between sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards. Most mages see 
little point in kindling rivalries with other types of arcane 
spellcasters-magic is magic, regardless of the means-
and for the most part, sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks 
respect each other as fellow practitioners of the Art, under-
standing the power it represents. 
against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, 
the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet 
away from you. 
WIND SOUL 
At 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thun-
der damage. 
You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an 
action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 
hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet 
of you equal to 3 +your Charisma modifier. The chosen 
creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 
hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you 
can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
