MENZOBERRANZAN 
I eventually got away from the place, but not before I 
had learned more about Menzoberranzan than any 
sane person would care to know. Although the life of 
a slave can be brutally short in the City of Spiders, the 
draw aren't so extravagant that they do away with every 
captive they take. At the same time, they are masters 
of punishment- it is fear of pain, not fear of death, that 
motivates the slaves of draw. If you're lucky, you'll only 
feel normal shackles and the occasional whip or light 
spell-blast. A bit less luck or more malice, and the ser-
pent-headed whips of the priestesses come out. 
If you aren't a draw in the City of Spiders, you aren't 
worth a name. All manner of surface-dwellers-ores and 
elves, humans and halflings- are brought here to serve 
as slaves to the draw in their refuge. The constant fear 
of punishment, from one's mistress or another, more 
powerful draw, keeps most slaves obedient, even when 
they aren't directly supervised. 
The great cavern of the city is filled with tall spires, 
and homes both great and small are carved into the sta-
lagmites and stalactites that pierce the darkness. Gentle 
illumination from magic or glowing fungus decorates 
some homes and businesses, as well as the mansions of 
the high houses of the city, eight of which have positioned 
themselves above all others. While the lesser houses 
dance and fight and scheme for advantages over each 
other, they all live under the heel of House Baenre and 
the Matron Mother, who rules the city in Lolth's name. 
On a large plateau high above the cavern floor is Tier 
Breche, also called the Academy, where the city trains 
its priestesses, mages, and noble warriors. The city's 
market is centrally located, and rothe are raised on an 
isle toward the eastern edge of the city. 
If you are ever so unfortunate as to be enslaved by the 
draw of Menzoberranzan, my advice to you is simple 
and stern: do as you are commanded, avoid insulting 
their goddess (which means don't even brush off a 
spider crawling on you), and attempt escape only if you 
are desperate or sure of your survival. If you are given 
the proper opportunity, as I was, you might discover that 
the neck of a draw snaps with surprising ease. 
ESCAPE 
One day, well after I had lost count of how many days 
I'd been a captive, I was in a small outlying cavern with 
a few other slaves harvesting a mushroom patch. I was 
given leave to answer nature's call away from the mush-
rooms, and I lingered long enough in a side tunnel to 
force my watcher to come and find me. I took the first 
lash he offered me with his whip, then grabbed the 
weapon and pulled the skinny fool toward me before he 
could sound an alarm or get his blade out. It took me 
but a second to get both hands around his throat. When 
he lay dead at my feet, I took his sword and ran as fast 
and far as I could. I knew the gnomish city of Blingden-
stone was nearby, and I came upon it eventually, but the 
journey took days as I wound through convoluted pas-
sageways and tried to avoid notice. 
BLINGDENSTONE 
My initial joy at reaching Blingdenstone was quickly tem-
pered. The deep gnomes don't seem to like visitors they 
can't recognize or identify, and being a half-ore didn't help 
matters in the least for me. After dodging arrows loosed 
from the high walls of the city, I gave up on going through 
the gate and snuck in through a small cart tunnel, empty-
ing out part of a load of ore to make room for myself. 
I managed to avoid conflict with the guards that dis-
covered me in the cart. When they ordered me to stand, 
I did so with my weapon held at my side, and I turned to 
display my back to them. When they saw that it was cov-
ered in lashes and the scars of the priestesses' fanged 
whips, and they realized that my blade was of draw man-
ufacture (though I clearly was not), they were willing to 
believe my story. 
Though the gnomes kept me under watch, I was allowed 
to regain my strength for a few days, and I saw a bit of 
their community in the meantime. Once I was inside the 
city, I could tell that it's not much of a city at all. The svir-
fneblin all live in close contact with one another, and this 
togetherness can be disconcerting, especially for someone 
accustomed to small luxuries like shutters on windows 
and doors on privies. The homes are all smoothed-over 
natural stone, with little evidence of hard corners. 
Each industry has a portion of the city to itself: trad-
ing, smithing, mining, and the growing of a special 
fungus crop. Still many of the old tunnels and caverns 
remain unclaimed and sealed off, whether to guard 
against invasion or perhaps because of what now dwells 
there, I don't know. 
If you're welcomed long enough to the city, you can 
trade for fine goods and armor here; the gnomes' 
chain mail and mining picks seem most worth acquir-
ing. Before sending me on my way, the gnomes were 
kind enough to give me a pick, a dagger, and some of 
their trillimac, an odd fungus that can be made into 
something like bread. It's a bit spongy, but it doesn't 
spoil quickly, and it got me to the surface before I 
starved to death. 
THE CAVERN OF MENZOBERRANZAN 
Menzoberranzan fills a large vault that was formerly a 
lair of giant spiders and beholders. The vault is known by 
its dwarven name, Araurilcaurak ("Great Pillar Cavern"), 
because of Narbondel, the giant rock pillar at the vault's 
center that joins floor and ceiling. The cavern is roughly 
shaped like an arrowhead, with the pool of Donigarten at 
its tip, and stretching two miles across at its widest point. 
The ceiling rises a thousand feet high, and the floor is 
studded with stalagmites. 
Two areas rise above the rest of the city: Tier Breche, the 
side cavern occupied by the Academy where most drow cit· 
izens are trained for adulthood; and the larger Qu'ellarz'orl 
(or House-Loft) , a plateau that is home to many of the 
city's mightiest noble houses, separated from the lower 
city by a forest of giant mushrooms. From either of these 
heights, a surveyor can view the city. The view shows rows 
of spired stone castles, their sculpted highlights lit by the 
soft, tinted flows of permanent faerie fire lights.
