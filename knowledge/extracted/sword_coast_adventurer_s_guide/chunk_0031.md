THE RED KNIGHT 
The Lady of Strategy, the Crimson General, the 
Grandmaster of the Lanceboard 
The Red Knight is the goddess of planning and strategy. 
Those who favor her call themselves the Red Fellow-
ship. They believe wars are won by the best planning, 
strategy, and tactics. The worship of the Red Knight is 
fi lled with doctrine about strategy, such as: "Every war 
is a series of battles. Losing one doesn't mean losing 
the war." "In war, plan for peace. In peace, plan for war." 
"Seek allies among your enemy's enemies." 
Worship of the Red Knight arose among a hero-ven-
erating monastic order of Tempus in Tethyr shortly 
after the Time of Troubles. The Red Knight has since 
grown in popularity because of what her followers call 
the Great Stratagem: for decades, her priests have been 
traveling to places of warfare to educate generals and 
kings in the arts of strategy and battlefield tactics. Many 
of the leaders they approached turned them away at 
first, but it soon became apparent that those who ac-
cepted the counsel of the Crimson General's followers 
gained a distinct benefit. Grateful victors built temples to 
the Lady of Strategy, and gradually her faith spread. 
Today, followers of the Red Knight can be found in 
nearly any land that has seen warfare in the past cen-
tury. Worshipers of the Red Knight are rare in the gen-
eral population, but those who revere her can frequently 
be found among high-ranking commanders of armies, 
instructors in colleges of war, quartermasters, and the 
authors of tomes of strategy. Each temple to the Red 
Knight includes an altar dedicated to Tempus, and so 
such a place is likely to be frequented by mercenaries 
and soldiers. A temple is surrounded by a vast pavilion 
and courtyard, which can be rented by companies of 
soldiers and mercenaries for practice and training. Her 
priests believe that drilling one's troops in a temple 
courtyard is a form of propitiation that the Red Knight 
looks upon with special favor. 
SAVRAS 
The All-Seeing, the Third Eye, Divination's Lord 
Savras is a god of divination and fortunetelling. Few 
people worship him, but many pray to him when per-
forming small rituals of foresight. For example, young

men and women sometimes attempt to divine the names 
of their future spouses by saying a rhyming chant that 
calls upon Savras while gazing in a mirror. 
Savras has no currently active temples in Faerun, and 
his shrines are few and far between, tucked away in the 
corners of libraries and scriptoria. Despite this lack of 
prominence, certain folk pay regular homage to Savras, 
including investigators, diviners, judges, and others 
who have a need to uncover the truth. Such individuals 
can sometimes be identified by the elaborate staffs they 
carry in homage to Savras. According to legend, Savras 
was trapped in Azuth's staff for ages. Azuth eventually 
freed Savras so long as Savras swore fealty, and today 
the staff is a potent symbol for those who revere Savras. 
Devout worshipers take great pains to decorate and em-
bellish their staffs, each hoping that Savras might find it 
a welcoming place to stop for a time. 
SELUNE 
Our Lady of Silver, the Moonmaiden, the Night White Lady 
Selune is thought to be among the most ancient of 
Faerun's deities. Most humans in Faerun consider the 
moon in the sky to literally be the goddess gazing down 
on the world, and the trailing motes of light behind it her 
tears. She is also a goddess of stars and navigation as 
well as motherhood and reproductive cycles. She is seen 
as a calm power, frequently venerated by female humans 
as well as by a mix of other folk: navigators and sailors, 
those who work honestly at night, those seeking protec-
tion in the dark, the lost, and the questing. 
There are many legends about Selune, chief among 
them being the tale of the battle at the beginning of 
time between Selune and her sister, Shar. The Tears of 
Selune, the cluster of starry lights that follow the moon 
around the sky, are thought to be brought about by the 
goddess's joy, sorrow, or both. 
Milk, a symbol of motherhood, is used in many rites 
performed by the worshipers of Selune, as are trances 
and meditation. Those who favor her typically set a bowl 
of milk outside on each night of the full moon. 
SHAR 
The Mistress of the Night, the Dark Lady, Our Lady of 
Loss 
The dark twin of Selfine, Shar is the goddess of dark-
ness, both in its physical form and as it exists in the 
minds and souls of mortals. People worship Shar as
