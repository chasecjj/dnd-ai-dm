Kendrick banner and are determined to hold on long 
enough to see it. 
NORLAND 
North of Moray lies Norland, the stronghold of the 
Northlanders of the Isles. Much has happened among 
the Noris of late, weakening their grip on the Moon-
shaes, but I fear High King Kendrick lacks power to 
capitalize on it. 
In recent years, a Northlander woman calling herself 
the Storm Maiden arose as a battle leader among them, 
which was unusual because Northlanders don't allow 
women to raid or fish. Said to blessed by both Valkur 
and Umberlee at her birth, the Storm Maiden gathered 
great numbers of Noris to her banner, and it seemed she 
might contest the king for control of Norland. However, 
a decade ago, she seemed to be consumed by the power 
of Umberlee, and she drove her followers on a mad 
quest to control the Sea of Swords. When at last she 
was defeated at sea, she and her ship vanished into the 
waves. She is known to be unable to drown, and many 
people fear her return. 
Rault the Wise, king of the Noris, lost both his elderly 
son Olfgaut and grandson in battles against the Storm 
Maiden, leaving succession in question. He has a 
granddaughter of great spirit and wisdom, but in the 
male-dominated Northlander society- and so soon after 
the disastrous rise to power of the Storm Maiden- it is 
unthinkable that rule should fall to her. 
OMAN 'S ISLE 
The last time I set foot on Oman's Isle was just after the 
Moonshaes had unified, and it was a peaceful, lovely 
place. It had sheep, farms, and fishing boats, and plenty 
of folk willing to trade the gold from their mines for 
goods from the mainland or other islands. Now, Oman's 
Isle is a blasted place is controlled by giants, especially 
fomorians, that hurl huge stones at any ship that comes 
too near the coast. If you do make it to shore, bring 
friends, and plenty of weapons-it's a dangerous place, 
but might be worth the risk. I can scarcely imagine the 
reward Jar! Rault or High King Derid would offer to the 
adventurers who reclaimed the ruins of Iron Keep, once 
home to the isle's rulers. 
SNOWDOWN 
The little isle of Snowdown, south of Alaron, is a pos-
session of Arnn, where Lady Erliza rules from Caer 
Westphal. She is the second of her name, noted for her 
striking resemblance to her great-grandmother, the first 
Amnian ruler of the isle. 
Since taking possession of the place, Snowdown's 
occupiers have cut down its woods, stripped its mines, 
and choked its waterways with the refuse of the over-
worked Ffolk under their rule. Lady Erliza and her 
soldiers have ruthlessly put down several rebellions, 
and the Ffolk here refer to her as "Bloody Erliza." Some 
Amnians believe the isle is becoming more trouble to 
hold on to than its diminishing exports are worth, and 
further uprisings are almost certainly brewing amongst 
the Ffolk, quietly supported by Alaron. 
NORTH LANDER ISLES 
Well to the north of the Moonshaes and west of Faerun 
are the home islands of the Northlanders, which exist 
as they have for centuries. The greatest of these islands, 
Ruathym, holds the oldest settlements the Northlanders 
claim, and from there, all manner of northern kingdoms 
and legends have sprung. 
The Northlander Isles are scoured by strong winds 
and powerful waves, and also suffer biting, bone-chilling 
cold for most of the year. In deepest winter, the inlets 
are choked with ice, and fog lingers late into the day, if 
it breaks at all. Most wear furs to keep out the cold, and 
those going to war supplement their protection with 
thicker hides, and helms lined with wool or fur. They 
disdain magic and glorify battle, to the point that most 
communities grow restless when they don't have an 
enemy to fight. 
Because the Northlanders are good at fighting and 
sailing, and perfectly willing to attack ships close to 
their shores, best to be cautious around any North-
lander Isles, especially if you haven't been assured of 
safe passage, and often even then. 
Northlanders pay homage to several deities, but 
they most honor Valkur, a hero-god of their own who 
exemplifies the qualities their warriors hold most dear. 
Take care not to question or insult this veneration in 
their presence. 
GUNDARLUN 
The fisherfolk and merchants of Gundarlun are more 
like their mainland cousins than most island folk. 
Unlike other Northlanders, they are less apt to start a 
fight with folk they don't recognize. Because of their 
more peaceful bent, you're more likely to be able to 
safely get fresh water and supplies in Gundarlun, though 
you should be prepared to trade generously during 
your stop. 
More than a dozen settlements pay homage to the 
king in Gundbarg. They profit from the island's reputa-
tion as a safe stopover. Though Gundarlun might not 
provide the best seaworthy warriors, nevertheless ship 
s that are looking to make repairs, take on sailors or 
sail-menders, or store large cargoes are likely to find 
their needs met here. 
PURPLE ROCKS 
If you seek shelter during a storm, you might find it 
in the many islands of the Purple Rocks. It was once 
my great fortune to find safe harbor at the port village 
known as Ulf of Thuger. The welcome I received was 
nearly as warm as I might have found among the Gunds, 
and I found the Rocklanders to be a fine audience for 
my tales of travel and adventure. However, something 
makes me think I shouldn't return. 
On the day that the storm broke, I emerged from 
the longhouse in which I had been hosted and beheld 
a well-tended and organized settlement with green 
pastures and full fishing nets. The ship's crew and I 
were dealt with cordially by everyone, and the ship was 
already repaired and prepared for our leaving, the Rock-
landers having apparently worked through the night to 
make it ready.
