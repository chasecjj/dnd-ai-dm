THE RED WIZARDS 
The most infamous group of wizards in the Realms are 
the Red Wizards of Thay. Garbed in their distinctive 
red robes, the Red Wizards have sought to expand 
their power and to extend Thay's influence across 
the Realms, particularly in lands in the East. They 
shave their heads and wear complex tattoos reflecting 
their ambitions and achievements and their favored 
school of magic. 
In Thay, the Red Wizards have ultimate power, al-
though they give governance of day-to-day affairs to 
those without skill in the Art. Every Red Wizard devotes 
study to one of the eight schools of magic and serves 
that school's zulkir, the leader and ultimate master of 
that style of magic. The zulkirs and their underlings 
constantly vie with one another for power and influence, 
and this competition frequently sends Red Wizards far 
from Thay to seek new spells, recover lost artifacts, and 
create wealth that can flow back to Thay. The power the 
Red Wizards hold in Thay gives them a measure of dip-
lomatic legitimacy in the lands of the Sword Coast and 
the North, but their presence is rarely welcome and is 
universally viewed with suspicion. 
WAR WIZARDS 
The potential for wizards to influence the outcome of 
battle is something no ruler in Faerfm can afford to 
ignore, and most great armies seek to recruit and in-
clude wizards among their ranks. Evokers are the most 
common, simply for the potential their spells have of 
inflicting the most damage to the greatest number of en-
emies. Still, all schools of magic find their applications 
in warfare. 
The War Wizards of Cormyr are perhaps the best 
known application of the Art to the field of battle. As 
much soldiers as they are scholars, many of them were 
members of the Purple Dragons before they began 
their training in the Art. In addition to field duty in 
times of war, the War Wizards also protect the royalty 
of Cormyr, and each one swears a magic oath of ser-
vice to the Crown. In this role, War Wizards serve as 
bodyguards, advisors, and even spies. Members of the 
royal family, Purple Dragon Knights, and officers of the 
Purple Dragons frequently wear magic rings that allow 
a War Wizards to know where they've gone and to scry 
upon them. Removing such a ring, even for innocent 
reasons, can call a cadre of battle-ready War Wizards to 
teleport nearby with attack spells already in the midst of 
being cast. 
ARCANE TRADITION 
Wizards in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Arcane Tradition option, in addition to those in the Play-
er's Handbook. 
BLADESINGING 
Bladesingers are elves who bravely defend their people 
and lands. They are elf wizards who master a school of 
sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. 
In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, 
MACE SICILS 
Wizards and many other arcane spellcasters develop a 
signature rune, which they use to identify their belongings, 
sign as their name, and warn others. As a mage gains in 
power, more individuals recognize the sigil and connect 
it with a mighty spellcaster, not to be trifled with. Some 
mage sigils are used in conjunction with spells such as 
glyph of warding, which enforces the tendency of ordinary 
people to shy away from items marked by such sigils. 
There are folktales, in fact, about the gods themselves 
punishing a person who misuse's a wizard's sigil-prepos-
terous tales that were most likely started by wizards 
themselves. There is no set penalty for violating another 
mage's signature sigil or using it without permission. 
Powerful mages tend to punish such activity themselves to 
discourage further use. 
Apprentice wizards in Faerun are reminded of the 
dangers of misusing another spellcaster's sigil by a rhyme: 
"Whenever magic one doth weave / 'Tis never, ever, wise 
to deceive." 
elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the 
bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks 
and a cunning defense. 
RESTRICTION: ELVES ONLY 
Only elves and half-elves can choose the bladesinger 
arcane tradition. In the world of Faerfln, elves closely 
guard the secrets of bladesinging. 
Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the cam-
paign. The restriction reflects the story of bladesingers 
in the Forgotten Realms, but it might not apply to your 
DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.
