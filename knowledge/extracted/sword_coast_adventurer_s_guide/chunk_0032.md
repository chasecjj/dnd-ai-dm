the goddess of night, secrets, loss, and forgetfulness. 
She represents pains hidden but not forgotten, and ven-
geances .carefully nurtured away from the light. She is 
said to have the power to make folk forget their pain or 
become inured to a loss, and many people in distress 
pray to Shar for such a blessing. 
Shar is revered by those who must venture into dark 
places and so pray to her for protection, such as miners, 
as well as by those who have fallen into melancholy and 
despair, who wish to forget something, or who have lost 
something and wish to recover it. Priests drawn to serve 
Shar often nurture their own deep wounds or dark se-
crets, which in their minds makes them best suited to 
console those who suffer from a similar ill. Throughout 
the world's history, many followers of Shar have done 
dark deeds in her name- most notably the shadovar of 
Netheril, an entire society dedicated to Shar. The trag-
edies and losses brought about by the fanaticism of her 
followers have caused many places to outlaw her wor-
ship and thus driven most of her priests into secrecy, but 
such prohibitions only heighten the priests' umbrage at 
authorities and make the faithful a focal point for rebel-
lion and revenge against whoever rules. 
SILVANUS 
Oak Father, the Old Oak, Old Father Tree 
Silvanus represents the entirety of nature, deserts as 
well as forests, sharks as much as deer. But folk in the 
North, who contend with the dangers of forests, moun-
tains, and plains, see Silvanus more as a god of those 
places. Silvanus is thought of as a grim and severe 
father figure who metes out flood and drought, fire and 
ice, and life and death in the wilderness. In legends he 
often commands other nature deities, dealing out re-
wards and punishments to them as is fitting. 
Nature and its impartial fairness is central to the 
dogma of Silvanus's faith. His priests seek to know the 
total situation, to view the macrocosm; their viewpoint 
isn't confined to one person's or one nation's idea of 
what is best. The loss of a farming community to goblin 
raids is a tragedy for some, but the event provides an 
opportunity for the wilderness to grow up and make 
the land fertile again, which in turn provides new chal-
lenges for those who would return to tame it. 
The creed of Silvanus dictates that nature's glory must 
be preserved not merely because nature is beautiful, but 
because wild nature is the true state of the world. Its ex-
panses refresh and revitalize the mortal soul, and give 
SYM BOL OF SILVA NU S 
breath to all the world. Many of his faithful oppose the 
expansion of settlements into wild places, and consider 
excessive consumption of natural resources to be not 
only wasteful but blasphemous. 
Silvanus often receives veneration from travelers in 
wild lands, explorers, and residents of rural communi-
ties far from the protection of a local lord or a great city. 
The oak leaf is Silvanus's symbol, and a grove of oak 
trees within a village or on its outskirts is often dedi-
cated as a shrine to him. In rural places where oak trees 
don't grow, an oak leaf etched into the bark of another 
kind of tree signifies a sacred site. 
SUNE 
Lady Firehair, the Lady of Love, the Princess of Passion 
Sune Firehair is a deity of passion and the delights 
of the senses. She is the goddess of beauty in all its 
forms-not just pleasing sights, but also enchanting 
sounds, luxurious tastes and scents, and the exquisite 
pleasures of the flesh, from a lover's caress to the brush 
of silk on the skin. Her worshipers seek out these plea-
sures in life, not out of mere decadence, but because the 
experience of pleasure is the touch of Sune herself. 
The followers of Sune have a reputation as hedonists, 
and so they are, to a degree. More than that, her priests 
foster beauty in the world. They do so by creating art, by 
acting as patrons for promising talents, and by investing 
in merchants who bring luxuries to far-off places that 
have never seen satin or tasted a luscious wine. 
Her priests consider loveliness to be one of their 
greatest callings, and all are trained in comportment, 
fashion, and cosmetics. Indeed, so talented are Sune's 
priests in the creation of beautiful appearances that 
many take pride in their ability to present themselves as 
stunningly attractive examples of either gender. 
But beauty is more than skin deep, say the Sunites; it 
issues from the core of one's being and shows one's true 
face to the world, whether fair or foul. The followers of 
Sune are believers in romance, true love winning over 
all, and following one's heart to one's true destination. 
Fated matches, impossible loves, and ugly ducklings be-
coming swans are all in the purview of Sune. 
Temples dedicated to Sune are common in human 
lands, and they frequently serve as public baths and 
places of relaxation. A temple usually features a mir-
rored and well-lit salon where folks can primp, as well 
as see others and be seen. Where a temple doesn't exist, 
or in a large city where the nearest temple might be too
