COLLEGE OF THE HERALD 
Based at the great lore-house of Herald's Holdfast, 
northwest of Silverymoon, the College of the Herald is 
dedicated to the preservation of ancient history and leg-
ends. The Heralds are charged with collecting and orga-
nizing bodies of lore, which they make available to all of 
good and peaceful intent. Established by the Harper Ali-
ost Oskrunnar in 922 DR, the Heralds are allies of the 
Harpers but remain neutral in most conflicts, dedicated 
to preserving knowledge above all else. 
The College of the Herald is less concerned with mu-
sical performance (although it contains a considerable 
library of songs) and more with history, heraldry, and 
folklore, making it a key center of learning for bards of 
the College of Lore, as described in the Bard College 
class feature in the Player's Handbook. 
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 
In addition to the common musical instruments listed in 
chapter 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook, bards 
in the Realms play the following instruments: 
Birdpipes: Pan pipes or satyr pipes, also known as the 
shalm, these are sacred to Lliira and popular with 
wood elf and wild elf bards. 
Glaur: Short, curved horns like a cornucopia. Played 
with valves, glaur sound like trumpets, while 
those without valves, known as gloon, have a more 
mournful sound. 
Hand Drum: A double-headed skin drum fitted with 
handles along its side. 
CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 
Longhorn: A Faerilnian flute of sophisticated make, 
found only in areas with skilled artisans, as in great 
cities or elven enclaves. 
Shawm: A double-reed instrument similar to an oboe or 
a bassoon, popular with gnomes, who have developed 
some bellows-powered versions. 
Songhorn: A recorder, a simple type of flute, usually 
carved from wood. 
Tantan: A tambourine, a popular instrument with 
halflings and humans south of the Dalelands. 
Thelarr: Also known as a whistlecane, a simple and 
easy-to-make wind instrument cut from a reed. They 
are so simple, in fact, that skilled bards frequently 
make and give them away to children-to the parents' 
delight or regret. 
Tocken: A hanging set of carved oval bells, usually 
played with a pair of light wooden hammers (or open 
handed). They are most common in underground 
cultures, where the resonant tones can carry. 
Wargong: A metal gong, traditionally made from a 
shield, particularly the shield of an enemy. Both 
goblins and dwarves make and play wargongs, their 
sound echoing through tunnels in the Underdark. 
Yarting: A southern instrument from Arnn and 
Calimshan that is a Faerilnian analog to the guitar. 
Numerous variations have spread across the 
continent. 
Zulkoon: A complex pump organ that originated with 
the zulkirs of Thay, who use it in the casting of 
their spells. It is considered to have a dramatic, but 
sinister, sound. 
THE MOONSTARS 
Over a century ago, the Harpers endured a schism. 
Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun was denounced by other 
Harper leaders for empowering Fzoul Chembryl, then the 
evil leader of the Zhentarim, with a powerful artifact. That 
Khelben did so in order that Fzoul destroy a dangerous 
lich mattered little. Khelben and Laeral Silverhand, his 
wife, left the Harpers then, taking with them certain agents 
and folding them into to a different organization, which 
Khelben had been secretly working to create for some time 
due to an old prophecy of the elves of Cormanthor. This 
group was the Moonstars, called Tel'Teukiira in Elvish. 
Although the Moonstars worked in concert at times with 
the Harpers, they also worked at cross purposes, and the 
Moonstars membership included many whom the Harpers 
considered too evil, such as a vampire. The Moonstars 
performed many good deeds, but their methods were 
often more brutal and pragmatic than the Harpers' 
lofty ideals allowed. When Khelben died, the Moonstars 
seemed to collapse, and for many years the organization 
was assumed defunct. Yet during the Sundering, Moonstar 
sleeper agents reactivated the organization on a surpris-
ingly massive scale, with members active in Candlekeep, 
Waterdeep, and Myth Drannor. The organization has 
since gone underground again. Their relationship to the 
present-day Harpers, Laeral Silverhand, and the current 
Blackstaff ofWaterdeep, Vajra, remains unclear.
