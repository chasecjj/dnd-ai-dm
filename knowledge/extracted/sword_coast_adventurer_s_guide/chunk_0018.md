DIVINE MAGIC 
The gods show their favor toward mortals in myriad 
ways. A chosen few have their minds and souls opened 
to the power of magic. There is no formula for who does 
and doesn't receive this divine insight, as the gods keep 
their own counsel concerning their selections. Some 
who are favored seek to ignore or deny their gift, while 
others embrace it wholeheartedly. 
Some who display the potential for divine magic de-
velop and practice their abilities in a temple, a sacred 
grove, or some other spiritual place, perhaps in the 
company of other students. Other practitioners of divine 
magic discover and nurture their gods-given power en-
tirely on their own.

THE GODS OF FAERUN 
The gods that make up the pantheon of Faerun are 
much like the population of some of the Realms' great-
est cities: an eclectic blend of individuals from a variety 
of sources. The makeup of the pantheon has shifted 
over the ages, as a result of changes in the Realms and 
its people (or vice versa, depending on which scholars 
you believe). The following pages describe the most 
prominent members of the pantheon. 
The deities of the Faerunian pantheon are by no 
means the only powers worshiped in the Realms. The 
nonhuman races have pantheons of their own (de-
scribed in chapter 3), and scattered other cults and local 
divinities can be found across Faerun.
