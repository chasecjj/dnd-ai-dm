BLADESINGER STYLES 
From its inception as a martial and magical art, Bladesing-
ing has been tied to the sword, more specifically the 
longsword. Yet many generations of study gave rise to 
various styles of Bladesinging based on the melee weapon 
employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from 
master to students in small schools, some of which have 
a building dedicated to instruction. Even the newest styles 
are hundreds of yea rs old, but are still taught by their orig-
inal creators due to the long lives of elves. Most schools of 
Bladesinging are in Evermeet or Evereska. One was started 
in Myth Drannor, but the city's destruction has scattered 
those students who survived. 
Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on 
the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with 
a category of animal. Within that style are specializations 
named after specific animal types, based on the types of 
spells employed, t,he techniques of the master, and the 
particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice 
to a master typically get a tattoo of their chosen style's 
animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear 
many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their 
deadly skills. 
Cat. Styles that employ a sword belong to this family. 
The lion style, the eldest, trains practitioners in the use 
of the longsword and doesn't favor any particular type of 
spells. Leopard style focuses on the shortsword and spells 
of illusion and stealth. Red tiger, a style just three centuries 
old, has its bladesingers using the scimitar in a whirling 
dance of defense from which they launch into sudden 
leaps and attacks. 
Bird. Styles that focus on the use of a hafted weapon, 
such as an axe or hamme r, have been grouped together 
as bird styles, yet they vary wildly. All relatively new styles, 
they use weapons not typically favored by elves. Eagle-style 
bladesingers use small handaxes, and many maneuvers 
in the style focus on fluid ways to throw the weapon and 
draw a new one. Raven style uses a pick, and spells associ-
ated with it grant the bladesinger more agility in combat. 
Snake. Practitioners of these styles use a flail, chain, or 
whip. Viper style uses a whip, despite its inelegance as a 
weapon, and has almost as long a history as the lion style. 
Its masters punctuate their bladesong with a stunningly 
rapid rhythm of wh ip cracks, which can keep many foes at 
bay and allow the bladesinger space to cast the cruel spells 
of poison and disease favored by the style. 
TRAINING IN WAR AND SONG 
When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain pro-
ficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with 
one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice. 
You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if 
you don't already have it. 
BLADESONG 
Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a secret elven 
magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't 
wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It 
graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus. 
You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, 
which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapac-
itated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or 
if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. 
You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time you 
choose (no action required). 
CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 
While your Bladesong is active, you gain the follow-
ing benefits: 
You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence 
modifier (minimum of+ 1). 
Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. 
You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. 
• You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw 
you make to maintain your concentration on a 
spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum of +l). 
You can use this feature twice. You regain all ex-
pended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. 
EXTRA ATTACK 
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
SONG OF DEFENSE 
Beginning at 10th level, you can direct your magic to ab-
sorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you 
take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one 
spell slot and reduce that damage to you by an amount 
equal to five times the spell slot's level. 
SONG OF VICTORY 
Starting at 14th level, you add your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum of +1) to the damage of your melee weapon 
attacks while your Bladesong is active. 
CANTRIPS FOR SORCERERS, 
WARLOCKS, AND WIZARDS 
Practitioners of the Art have developed the following 
cantrips for those who favor casting spells in melee. War 
Wizards of Cormyr, bladesingers, and warlocks of the 
Pact of the Blade are especially fond of these spells. 
These cantrips are on the sorcerer, warlock, and wiz-
ard spell lists. 
BOOMING BLADE 
Evocation cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 5 feet 
Components: V, M (a weapon) 
Duration: 1 round 
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must 
make a melee attack with a weapon against one crea-
ture within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. 
On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, 
and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the 
start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves be-
fore then, it immediately takes 1d8 thunder damage, and 
the spell ends. 
This spell's damage increases when you reach higher 
levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 
thunder damage to the target, and the damage the target 
takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls 
increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.
