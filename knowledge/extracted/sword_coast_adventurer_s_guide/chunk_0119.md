Courtesy. Treat others with respect despite how they 
treat you. Give honor to those above your station. Earn 
the respect of those below your station. 
Lawfulness. Laws exist to bring prosperity to those 
under them. Unjust laws must be overturned or 
changed in a reasonable fashion. 
Bravery. Gain glory through battle. Defend any charge 
unto death. 
Pride in one's actions. Lead by example. Let your 
deeds speak your intentions. 
Humility in one's deeds. Do not boast or accept 
rewards undue to you. 
Unselfishness. Share resources, especially with those 
who have the most need. 
Good-temperedness. Render service cheerfully and 
without disdain. 
Wisdom. Cause the most good through the least harm. 
Piety. Be faithful to the precepts of your god. 
Kindness. Protect the weak. Grant mercy to those who 
seek redemption. 
Honor. Hold true to the code. Death before dishonor. 
Every paladin grades and emphasizes these virtues 
based on his or her own personal ethos and religious 
background. A paladin of Sune would emphasize as-
pects of courtly love and courtesy, whereas a paladin of 
Tyr would be more concerned with justice and fair treat-
ment of foes. 
Most paladins in the Forgotten Realms, like clerics, 
are devoted to a particular deity. The most common 
paladin deities are those that embody action, decision, 
watchfulness, and wisdom. Torm and Tyr are both 
popular deities for paladins, as is Ilmater, who stresses 
self-sacrifice and the alleviation of suffering. Although 
less common, there are paladins of the following dei-
ties: Helm, Hoar, Lathander, Sune, Corellon Larethian, 
the Red Knight, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Arvoreen, 
and Mystra. 
Their devotion to a higher ideal makes paladins pop-
ular folk heroes in the Realms. Many tales are woven 
about noble knights and oath-sworn champions, al-
though pragmatists note that the tales often end with a 
tremendous sacrifice on the part of said champions. 
The most common patrons of paladins of the Oath of 
Devotion and the Oath of the Crown (which is described 
below) are Helm, Torm, and Tyr- protection, courage, 
and justice-although Ilmater has his share of devoted 
champions. Those green knights sworn to the Oath of 
the Ancients might honor Arvoreen or Corellon, while 
avengers of the Oath of Vengeance follow patrons like 
Hoar, although there are also avengers of Helm and Tyr, 
meting out harsh justice. 
PALADIN ORDERS 
The following orders can be found in various parts of 
the Forgotten Realms. 
ORDER OF THE COMPANION 
Based in Elturgard in the Western Heartlands, the Or-
der of the Companion is sworn to guard that nation. It 
formed in the wake of the Spellplague and helped to cre-
ate Elturgard, centered on the city of Elturel, overlook-
CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 
ing the River Chionthar. The Companions safeguard civ-
ilization against dangerous and wild forces, particularly 
unnatural creatures. Of the options in the Sacred Oath 
class feature, the Oath of the Crown (described below) 
and the Oath of Devotion (described in the Player's 
Handbook) are equally represented among their ranks. 
ORDER OF THE GILDED EYE 
The monastery and cathedral of Helm's Hold stands on 
the edge of the Neverwinter Wood in the North as a safe 
haven for travelers. The Order of the Gilded Eye safe-
guards the hold and serves the surrounding community, 
but their mission has a much broader focus: to guard the 
world from dangers originating on other planes of exis-
tence, especially on the Lower Planes. Many paladins 
and non-paladins have joined the order in response to 
its call to cast fiendish incursions out of the world. In re-
cent years, many have ventured forth from Helm's Hold 
to do the order's work in the wider world. 
Of the options in the Sacred Oath class feature in the 
Player's Handbook, paladins of the Gilded Eye most 
often follow the Oath of Devotion, although a few zealots 
are followers of the Oath of Vengeance. 
ORDER OF SAMULAR 
The Holy Order of Samular, also known as the Knights 
of Samular, is made up of warriors in the service of Tyr. 
The order is based at Summit Hall, while also maintain-
ing a chapter house in Waterdeep. Legendary paladin 
Samular Caradoon founded the order in 952 DR after 
the Second Troll War and the deaths of his brothers 
Renwick "Snowcloak" and Amphail the just during the 
war. When Tyr fell silent and the paladins in his service 
lost their powers, many turned to other gods such as 
Torm, but the Kights of Samular stayed true to Tyr. 
Their patience was recently rewarded when, upon Tyr's 
return to the world, many of their dwindling number 
were invested with the powers of a paladin. Known for 
their support of the law, many paladins of the order fol-
low the Oath of the Crown, which is described below. 
SACRED OATH 
Paladins in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Sacred Oath option, in addition to those in the Play-
er's Handbook. 
OATH OF THE CROWN 
-------
The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civili-
zation, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, 
or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins 
who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving 
society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society 
together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on 
the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barba-
rism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has 
built, and are commonly known as guardians, exem-
plars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath 
are members of an order of knighthood in service to a 
nation or a sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of 
their admission to the order's ranks.
