CHAPTER 2: THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
HIS CHAPTER DETAILS MANY OF THE 
locales of the Sword Coast and the North, 
as seen through the eyes and recollections 
of a person living in Faen1n. Rather than 
being exhaustive descriptions, what 
follows are snippets of information drawn 
from the experience of five individuals 
who have traversed, lived in, and explored these areas. 
Like any other narrators, they have opinions and biases, 
and may be drawing conclusions from incomplete 
information. No one in the Realms knows everything 
about any subject, even its oldest and most learned 
sages, and the views formed from such incomplete 
information can often suggest an inaccurate conclusion. 
This is not to say that any of the information the 
narrators provide is false, only that they may not be 
entirely knowledgeable in their declarations. 
The details given here only begin to scratch the 
surface of the adventuring possibilities in the North. 
Although some of these locales are virtually unknown 
to outsiders, entire books longer than this one could be 
(and have been) written about others. If the descriptions 
leave you wanting to know more, consider them an 
inducement for you and your companions to visit these 
places and experience them firsthand. 
Be aware, also, that there is a great deal more to the 
North than what is presented here. There are ruins 
without names, and settlements so small as to not 
even warrant mention in this tome. What lurks in the 
uncharted areas, waiting to tantalize or perhaps ter-
rorize, is all the more formidable because it can't be 
anticipated. 
THE LORDS' ALLIANCE 
F O R A CENTURY AND A HALF, AND MORE, THE LORDS' 
Alliance has stood as the most important and influential 
group in the North. Its power has kept towns safe from the 
predations of larger powers, has kept the ambitions of Lus-
kan in check, and has taught the rulers of many cities that 
it is better to cooperate, even for a time, then to merely shut 
one's doors and allow the storms to rage outside. It was this 
philosophy that led to the founding of Luruar, and when the 
lesson was lost, so too were the Silver Marches. But it serves 
no purpose to dwell on the folly of the past. Better instead 
to look to the f uture, repair the walls, and wait for word 
from the watching sentries. 
- Andwe Cururen, agent of the Lords' Alliance 
The Lords' Alliance isn't a nation unto itself, but a 
partnership of the rulers of towns and cities across 
the North, who have pledged peace with one another 
and promised to share information and effort against 
common threats such as ore hordes and Northlander 
pirates. It is a loose confederation of those settlements 
and their agents, all of whom owe allegiance first to 
their homelands, and second to the Lords' Alliance. 
In the harsh lands of the North, where winters are 
cold and monsters and human barbarians regularly 
stream out of the mountains to pillage outlying settle-
ments, large nations are rare indeed, particularly in the 
current state of the world. Instead, great city-states have 
emerged, enriched by trade and protected by stout walls 
and loyal defenders. Such cities- including Baldur's 
Gate, Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, and Water-
deep-extend their influence into nearby regions, often 
creating or accepting vassal settlements, but in the end, 
these realms are cities, driven to consider their own pro-
tection and future before other concerns. 
In the years soon after its founding more than one 
hundred fifty years ago, there was more interest in mem-
bership, and the Alliance accepted some members from 
farther south. Since then, events such as the growth of 
Elturgard into a power in its own right, and the recent 
fall of the Silver Marches, have caused the group to 
draw in on itself, restricting its membership to powers 
in the North. The current members of the Alliance are 
Amphail, Baldur's Gate, Daggerford, Longsaddle, Mira-
bar, Mithra! Hall, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, 
and Yartar. There is some doubt that Mithra! Hall will 
be part of the alliance for much longer, but until ruler-
ship of the dwarven city is more firmly established, it 
remains a member. 
It is impossible to ascribe an overall character to 
the individual members of the alliance. As a group, 
the agents of the members are interested in the pres-
ervation of civilization in the North, and they share 
what information they can- and oppose what threats 
they must- to further that goal. In the end, though, a 
merchant of Waterdeep and one of Baidu r's Gate are 
concerned mainly for their own purses and the welfare 
of their home cities, and are unlikely to care what hap-
pens to the other, except inasmuch as it affects trade. 
The advice and insights in this section come from 
Andwe Cururen, a half-elf native of Silverymoon who 
was once a Knight in Silver (a member of the city's 
army), and now serves as an emissary and, when neces-
sary, an active agent for the Lords' Alliance. She travels 
the North on behalf of the Alliance, representing its 
interests and gathering and updating information on its 
settlements for her superiors, fellow agents, and poten-
tial recruits, including adventurers who might serve the 
Alliance or one of its members. 
AM PH AIL 
Named for its founder, a former warlord of Waterdeep, 
the small town of Amphail is home to just over seven 
hundred souls, yet it sought and received membership 
in the Lords' Alliance just under a century ago, thanks 
to the maneuverings of the noble families that control 
its lands. Where once it was simply an example of 
the extent ofWaterdeep's reach, Amphail became the 
playground of that city's noble families, a place where 
they can scheme against their rivals and send their
