ness that energy inside an object until it is called forth 
by its user (who, of course, need not be a spellcaster). 
In some cases, the magic of an item must be tied to 
its wielder; representing an entwining of the threads 
of the Weave between wielder and object known as 
attunement. As with all matters related to magic, the 
number of items to which a single being can be attuned 
is limited, but the benefits of such a relationship can be 
considerable. 
MYTH A LS 
Mythals are some of the most powerful magic in the 
world of Tori!, constructs that bind and shape the 
Weave in a particular location, sometimes so powerfully 
that the rules of magic or even reality can be bent or 
rewritten. 
A mythal is a permanent field of overlapping magical 
wards and effects tied to a specific location. In its origi-
nal usage, this term applied to the works of High Magic 
that protected ancient elven cities. It has since been 
expanded to cover all manner of similar protections, 
from the immense floating cities of fallen Netheril to 
the wards of Silverymoon to the smaller- but no less 
effective- workings of magic that keep safe important 
locations like Candlekeep. Even the many-layered wards 
and effects of Undermountain, beneath Waterdeep, are 
considered a mythal by some. 
Most my thals are defensive in nature, designed to 
restrict the kinds of magic that can be employed in the 
area they govern, and the most common restrictions are 
concerned with teleportation and conjuration magic. Ev-
ereska's mythal influences the weather of the area and 
wards its inhabitants against disease, while the mythal 
of undersea Myth Nantar makes its waters breathable 
and more comfortable for creatures not suited to under-
water life. 
In many ways, a mythal is less like a spell or a magic 
item than a living creation of magic, capable of grow-
ing stronger or weaker, absorbing damage, or dying. 
Mythals can also sometimes heai themselves, as did 
the mythal of Silverymoon, blossoming out of the 
Moonbridge following Mystra's most recent return. 
Each active mythal has one or more beings attuned 
to its effects, who can ignore any restrictions on spell-
casting, can direct targetable effects of the mythal, and 
can teach others of appropriate skill how to access 
its secrets. 
Except in cities such as Silverymoon and Evereska, 
adventurers are most likely to encounter damaged or 
failing mythals in ruined locations where magic once 
had great influence. Although an identify spell might 
reveal some of the simplest effects of a mythal, active 
restrictions on spellcasting can be discovered only by 
trying (and failing) to cast a prohibited spell. A powerful 
spellcaster might learn how to access or repair a mythal 
without assistance, but such feats are legendary, and 
rarely attempted by even the most renowned of mages. 
Any elven city with Myth in its title (Myth Drannor, 
Myth Glaurach, Myth Nantar, and others) has, or had, a 
mythal protecting it. The ruins of such places are cer-
tain to have unpredictable effects related to their dam-
aged or destroyed my thals. 
WEAVE-AFFECTING MAGIC 
Certain spells allow casters to perceive or manipulate the 
effects of the Weave in particular ways. The Weave itself 
also has irregularities that affect spells. 
Detect Magic. Detect magic reveals threads of the Weave 
woven together through spellcasting, or the "knots" of the 
Weave in a magic item. A magic item appears enmeshed 
in the silvery-blue threads of the Weave, and the way the 
threads are arranged reveals what type of magic is used 
(necromancy, abjuration, and so on). Similarly, active 
spells and areas imbued with magic are limned in a silvery 
network of threads, which might twist and reknit them-
selves depending on the magic involved. 
Dispel Magic. Dispel magic unwinds and prematurely 
ends magic, unraveling whatever construct of the Weave 
was put in place. 
Antimagic. Anti magic effects can dispel existing spells 
and unravel any magic woven from the Weave. Perma-
nent effects, such as those from magic items, are usually 
suppressed by anti magic: while the effect is within an 
area of anti magic, the construct of the Weave unravels, 
but the threads snap back into place once the magic is 
outside the area. 
Dead Magic. In rare areas of dead magic, the Weave 
is absent. Not only do spells and magic items cease to 
function, but even the supernatural abilities of creatures 
that are innately tied to the Weave might fail as the knot of 
the Weave they carry with them unravels. 
Wild Magic. In an area of wild magic, the Weave 
becomes "tangled," spontaneously forming its own 
constructs and resulting magic. It also tends to twist the 
constructs of the Weave created by spellcasting, causing 
unexpected results. 
RELIGION IN THE REALMS 
Though wizards work wonders with their Art, and 
adventurers take their fates into their own hands, it is 
on the gods that most folk in the Forgotten Realms de-
pend when they have need. The gods play a role in the 
lives of nearly everyone, from the mightiest lord to the 
meanest urchin. 
The various races of Tori! worship their pantheons, 
which remain largely the same from region to region, 
with different cultures and societies emphasizing some 
deities over others. Although exceptions exist- the gods 
of Mulhorand, for example- all the gods are revered 
across all of FaerCm. 
FORMS OF WORSHIP 
The average person worships different gods in different 
contexts. Most vocations have a patron deity: farmers 
make offerings to Chauntea for the prosperity of their 
crops, clerks sharpen their quills with a prayer to De-
neir, while pious merchants remember to set coins aside 
for Waukeen at the end of the day. Most people worship 
a deity associated with their livelihood, family, or home, 
while others feel called to a particular god for a variety 
of reasons. Individuals often carry or wear a small token 
of their favored deity: a pendant or a pin in the image of 
the god's holy symbol, or some other personal keepsake. 
In addition, people regularly venerate gods based on 
their needs and circumstances: a farmer whose favored 
deity is Chauntea would pray to Amaunator for a few 
clear, sunny days, and a Waterdhavian noble who habit-
