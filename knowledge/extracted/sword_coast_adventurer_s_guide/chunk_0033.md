far to walk to, a small shrine to Sune often stands near 
a street corner. These sites consist of a mirror hung 
beneath a small roof where one can say a prayer while 
checking one's appearance. The spot might feature a 
shelf or a cupboard holding various perfumes and cos-
metics so that those without the funds to purchase such 
items can still make themselves feel beautiful. 
TALON A 
Lady of Poison, Mistress of Disease, the Plague-crone 
One of the most often beseeched of FaerO.n's deities, 
Talona is the goddess of disease and poison, blamed for 
everything from common illnesses to crop failure to brack-
ish wells to plague. Depicted in temple iconography as a 
withered crone with a cup or a vase that holds all the vari-
eties of disease and poison, Talona is a fearsome goddess, 
and many are the prayers that beg her for protection from 
illness and poison. Various rituals to placate her involve the 
use of three drops of blood or three tears- to be dropped 
into a well that has gone bad, dripped into the handkerchief 
of someone beset by coughing, dropped into a fire made 
by burning a withered crop, dripped into the mouth of a 
plague sufferer, and so on. It's common practice to mark a 
container of poison with her holy symbol, three droplets in 
a triangle, and during epidemics folk paint the same image 
on the homes of the infected. 
Though she is often the recipient of prayers, Talona 
has almost no temples and few cults dedicated to her. A 
cult or a shrine to her might arise in an area after it suf-
fers from pestilence, when some of those who survived 
decide to revere her or even become priests. 
TALOS 
S tormlord, the Destroyer 
Talos is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and de-
structive force that might strike at any time. He is the 
god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and 
general destruction. He counts the ravager, the raider, 
the looter, and the brigand among his followers. Those 
who favor him see life as a succession of random effects 
in a sea of chaos, so the devout should grab what they 
can, when they can-for who can say when Talos will 
strike and send them into the afterlife? 
Talos is portrayed as a broad-shouldered, bearded 
young man with a single good eye, the other covered 
by a dark patch. He is said to carry a collection of three 
staffs, made from the first tree cut down in the world, 
SYM B OL OF T ALONA 
CHAPTER 1 I WELCOME TO THE REALMS 
the first silver smelted, and the first iron forged. He uses 
these staffs to raise destructive winds, cause terrible 
storms, and split the land in acts of rage. The three light-
ning bolts of his holy symbol represent these staffs, and 
when he vents his wrath on the world, he is thought to 
hurl them down from the sky as lightning strikes. 
Although Talos is a popular deity, his name is invoked 
more often out of fear than out of reverence. He does 
have priests, mostly traveling doomsayers, who warn 
of disasters to come and accept charity in exchange for 
blessings of protection. Many of his faithful wear a black 
eyepatch, even if both eyes are intact. 
TEMPUS 
The Foehammer, the Lord of Battles 
Tempus is a war god concerned with brave conduct 
during war, using force of arms over talk for settling 
disputes, and encouraging bloodshed. The god of war is 
random in his favors, meaning that his chaotic nature fa-
vors all sides equally. Lord Tempus might be an army's 
ally one day, and its enemy the next. He might seem to 
manifest before a battle, appearing to one side or the 
other. If he is seen riding a white mare (Veiros), then the 
army will succeed. If he rides a black stallion (Deiros), 
then defeat is certain. Most often he appears to be rid-
ing with one foot in each mount's stirrup, signifying the 
unpredictable nature of battle. In such visions, Tempus 
is always a powerfully built warrior dressed for battle in 
the style of those who envision him. 
Tempus's favor might be randomly distributed, but 
over the centuries his priests have made an effort to 
spread and enforce a common code of warfare-to make 
war a thing of rules, respect for reputations, and pro-
fessional behavior. This code, called Tempus's Honor, 
has the purpose of making conflicts brief, decisive, and 
as safe as possible for those not directly involved. The 
rules in the code include the following: arm anyone who 
has need of a weapon; disparage no foe; acquit oneself 
with bravery; train all for battle; and don't engage in 
feuds. Those who poison wells, taint fields, kill noncom-
batants, or engage in torture in the name of war are all 
considered sinners. 
Worshipers of Tempus are legion, and his name is 
often on the lips of soldiers. His priests are tacticians, 
often skilled in the art of war. Many of his ordained 
don't serve in temples, but as battlefield chaplains with 
armies and mercenary companies, encouraging their 
fellow soldiers with both word and blade. Priests of
