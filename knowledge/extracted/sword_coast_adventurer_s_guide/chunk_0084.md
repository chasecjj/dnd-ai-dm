LOST TRIBES OF THE UTHGARDT 
Given the rebirth of the Blue Bear tribe in recent years, it 
might be incorrect to assume that any Uthgardt tribe is 
truly extinct. Nevertheless, several tribes are known today 
only by prior reputation, not present accomplishments. 
The Thunderbeast tribe has not been heard from in 
several years. When the Thunderbeasts made their annual 
pilgrimage to Morgur's Mound in Neverwinter Wood, they 
found their holy site desecrated. Soon thereafter, their 
chieftain took them back into the depths of the High For-
est, and they have not emerged since. 
The Gray Wolf tribe, made up of lycanthropes, was de-
stroyed by a Selunite crusade because of the tribe's curse. 
Some of the su rviving Gray Wolves took shelter among 
other Uthgardt tribes. 
The Griffon tribe came to an untimely end when it rose 
against the forces of Luruar allied with giants and ores. 
The Red Pony and Golden Eagle tribes vanished cen-
turies ago. They were last seen in the vicinity of the 
One Stone, the ancestral mound those tribes shared 
with Sky Pony. 
connection to places she saw as providing prey for 
her tribe. 
If a band of Uthgardt come upon your campsite, my 
advice is this. First, do what you can to hide all signs of 
magic or spellcasting. Then show them hospitality and 
invite them to warm themselves. If you have jewelry or a 
fine weapon, offer these gifts to the one who seems like 
the leader. Ask how their hunting goes, and give them 
a chance to brag. Be appreciative, but not obsequious. 
Tell them you have heard of the prowess of the Uthgardt 
people- their hunting skills and strength first and fore-
most- but attribute these claims to a tribe other than 
their own. The strongest among the band will insist on 
the chance to prove him- or herself better than the sto-
ries you've heard, and will want you to bear away tales 
of about his or her tribe instead. 
You or one of your companions might need to agree 
to a challenge of some kind, a feat of strength or a bout 
of fisticuffs, by which the band may measure your prow-
ess. It doesn't greatly matter if you win or lose, though. 
Simply express a desire or a willingness to compete, 
and you will earn some measure of respect. If you win 
the challenge, be gracious, and express gratitude that 
you finally found someone of great status to test yourself 
against. If you lose, be self-effacing and rueful, and give 
the victor the best part of the meal at hand. 
This advice will not always work, of course. Some 
bands aren't so easily assuaged, particularly if they are 
out deliberately hunting you or folk like you. At all times, 
remember that these are a proud and strong people with 
a fierce love of life and its simple pleasures. Demon-
strate an outlook complementary to theirs, and they 
might make of you a comrade. Show fear or contempt, 
and they will respond with quick violence. 
THE PEOPLE OF UTHGAR 
The Uthgardt trace their origins back to the mighty 
hero Uthgar, a warrior without compare. During my 
time with his tribe, Gyrt spoke freely of the tales of 
Uthgar that have been passed down among his people. 
The saga begins in the distant past when the humans 
of the North lived in fear and isolation. Great spirits 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
roamed the forests of the North, preventing humans 
from banding together to rise up against them. Into 
this turmoil came Uthgar, who challenged each of the 
great spirits, one at a time, besting them and subju-
gating them to his rule. Each of the defeated spirits 
became embodied in the totem of one of the groups of 
humans who followed and revered Uthgar. Thus were 
born the tribes of the Uthgardt, each taking the name 
of their totem spirit. 
The sites of Uthgar's victories are marked even today 
with the great ancestor-mounds of the Uthgardt. Each 
is said to have been built over the remains of a tribe's 
totem spirit, along with the tribesfolk who died while 
helping Uthgar to fight the creature. 
A tribe lays claim to the territory around its ancestral 
mound for many leagues, declaring it as the grounds 
in which the tribe hunts and sets up camps. Generally 
speaking, Uthgardt bands of a given tribe will range as 
far as two to three weeks' travel away from the tribe's 
ancestral mound, with raiding parties going much far-
ther afield. These holy sites are scattered through the 
North; in almost all cases, the exact location of one is 
known to few people other than members of that tribe. 
Almost all of the original tribes of the Uthgardt are 
active in the North today. Even a tribe thought to be 
lost or destroyed might be represented somewhere by 
a small number of humans who claim to be descended 
from the one of the tribes of old, but such people, where 
they exist, aren't numerous by any means, and their 
claims are often spurious. 
The Uthgardt take their ritual practices and taboos 
very seriously. Most taboos and traditions vary from 
tribe to tribe, but at least one stricture is universal 
among the Uthgardt: magic other than that of the sha-
mans or the magic of weapons and armor is forbidden. 
The priests of the Uthgardt revere their ancestor-god 
and also invoke the names of their totems as interces-
sors with the Father of the Tribes. Their ethos is simple: 
strength is rewarded with more strength, and when 
strength fails, it is because a person is not worthy. 
WARLOCK'S CRYPT 
On the western edge of the Troll Hills lies an area of 
bizarre terrain: shattered rubble is strewn across the 
landscape, between and among mounds of upturned 
earth and deep furrows of the sort one commonly sees 
in the wake of trebuchet blows that miss their mark. 
Farther in from the perimeter of this blasted land lies 
a scattered mess of buildings, some relatively intact, 
others half-collapsed and leaning on their neighbors. 
In the center, rising above it all, is a handful of twisted 
towers looking for all the world like talons clawing at 
the sky. These towers can be seen from a good distance, 
seemingly unharmed by the cataclysm that produced 
the damage around them. Indeed, because of their pris-
tine condition, some folk conjecture that these towers 
must have been built after that event. 
The truth of the place now called Warlock's Crypt 
is something different altogether. All of the structures 
visible here, from the now-shattered outbuildings to the 
central towers, comprised a city that floated atop a disc 
of stone during the time of ancient Netheril. When the
