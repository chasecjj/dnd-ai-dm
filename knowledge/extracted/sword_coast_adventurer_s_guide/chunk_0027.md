proper afterlife. Kelemvor's priests teach that those who 
revere the gods according to the rites of their religion 
have done t,heir proper service and will be offered the 
afterlife they seek. 
The faithful of Kelemvor provide people with peaceful 
transitions into the care of the Lord of the Dead. They 
help the dying put their affairs in order, and they offici-
ate at funeral rites for those who can't afford the lavish 
ceremonies of their faith. The tenets of Kelemvor's 
faithful compel them to forestall or prevent untimely 
deaths whenever possible. Different sects and worship-
ers define "untimely" in different ways. One group might 
concentrate on stopping the spread of disease, another 
on the prevention of murder, and yet another on elimi-
nating the scourge of the undead. In fact, all the faithful 
of Kelemvor despise the undead and work to some 
degree to eliminate them, for undead of any sort are 
seen as an abomination of the natural order. This belief 
obviously puts Kelemvor's faithful at odds with necro-
mancers, priests of Myrkul, and others who promote the 
creation of the undead, and it also causes conflict from 
unexpected sources. For instance, priests of Kelemvor 
routinely destroy any writings about the creation of the 
undead that they find-an act that offends those who 
value knowledge for its own sake, such as the faithful of 
Oghma and Deneir. And there also exist undead that ar-
en't evil, such as the baelnorn, which the elves consider 
holy. Kelemvor's devotees seek the end of such beings 
regardless of that fact. 
LATHAN DER 
The Morninglord, Inspiration's Dawn, the Rose-and-
Gold God 
Lathander is the god of the spring, birth, and renewal, a 
deity of conception, vitality, youth, renewal, and self-per-
fection. He is god not of the sun but of the dawn, which 
represents the start of a new day filled with potential. 
Lathander is a god of beginnings. People commonly 
offer a prayer to him before undertaking any journey or 
endeavor. Lathander's name is invoked to seal alliances 
and christen new ventures or companies. As a result, 
the god is very popular among the merchant classes, 
and the church has benefited accordingly. 
The rising sun is his symbol, and his colors are the 
rose, gold, and violet of the dawn. Lathander's temples 
and shrines host a wide range of functions both munic-
ipal and personal. At such places folk get married in 
dawn ceremonies, announce the start of civic projects,

and even give birth when possible, to provide the baby 
good fortune. 
The faithful of Lathander embrace the founding of 
new communities and the growth of civilization, as long 
as that civilization gives everyone the potential to suc-
ceed. They despise the undead, seeing them as both a 
corruption of the natural order and a disavowal of new 
beginnings, because undead cling to their old existence 
rather than moving on. 
LEI RA 
The Lady of the Mists, Mistshadow, the Lady of 
Deception 
Leira has worn many masks, and more than once has 
been thought to be dead or to be another deity alto-
gether. Perhaps such a reputation is only natural for the 
goddess of illusion and deception. Her faithful agree 
that whatever the "truth" might be, their Lady takes 
great delight in the confusion sown by her various incar-
nations. Even the faithful of Cyric once taught that their 
god killed Leira, but now they espouse the strange idea 
that somehow she is his daughter. 
Leira isn't viewed as malicious or as a trickster but is 
seen as enigmatic, quiet, and retiring. She is credited 
with inventing Ruathlek, the language of illusionists and 
the spoken tongue of Nimbral. 
The faithful of Leira seem to be scarce, although it 
is difficult to know this for certain, because those who 
favor her rarely make their inclinations known. Leira 
is the patron of illusionists and liars. She receives little 
regular worship except from illusionists, who pray to the 
Mistshadow for potency in their magic, and con artists, 
for whom she is a kind of champion. Most people pray to 
her when they hope to keep something secret, or placate 
her with a prayer before making an important decision 
when they fear being deceived. Some folk perform a 
swirling motion with a finger behind their backs when 
telling a lie as a way of beseeching her for aid. 
Her priests wear vestments of white and mist-gray, 
and their faces are covered by smooth, featureless 
masks. Only in Nimbral do temples to Leira exist, and 
shrines dedicated to her found across the continent are 
usually disguised as-other kinds of sites, marked with 
signs that only the faithful would recognize.
