AMAUNATOR 
The Keeper of the Eternal Sun, the Light of Law, the 
Yellow God 
Trickery 
Death 
The rule of law and the glory of the sun are both in Am-
aunator's dominion. His priests help establish bureau-
cracies and lawful order in communities. They often wit-
ness contracts and signed agreements, stamping such 
documents with the sun-symbol of Amaunator to signify 
their validity. 
His priests teach that Amaunator has died and been 
reborn time and again. Like the sun, he might pass into 
the realm of darkness, but inevitably his bright gaze 
will fall on the world once again. Amaunator is seen 
as a stern and unforgiving deity, not unlike Silvanus in 
comportment, but his concern isn't for the balance of 
life- he cares that things proceed according to the ce-
lestial order, that promises are kept, and that the rule of 
law persists. 
SYMBOL OF AMAUNATOR 
Red crescent moon with a skull between the 
moon's horns 
White hand, palm outward 
Farmers and travelers beseech him when they pray 
for rain or sun, as do any others looking for a favorable 
change in the weather. But the most common form of 
propitiation to Amaunator is the practice of swearing 
oaths, signing contracts, and declaring laws under the 
light of the sun. So ingrained in the common perception 
is the connection between a solemn oath and the sun 
that those engaged in closing deals or issuing edicts 
often pause and wait for a passing cloud to clear the sun 
before completing the transaction or pronouncement. 
ASMODEUS 
The Lord of the Ninth, The Cloven, Old Hoof and Horn 
Open worship of Asmodeus began roughly a century 
ago when small cults with charismatic leaders sprang 
up in the aftermath of the Spell plague. That catastrophe 
left many asking why the gods were angry or had aban-
doned them. To those questioners, the faithful of Asmo-
deus provided answers and a god who would forgive all
