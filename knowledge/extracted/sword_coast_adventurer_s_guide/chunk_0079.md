his subjects. A guard might swear "by Jarant's crown" 
to emphasize an edict, and the yuan-ti who owned 
the keys to my shackles referred to Najara's laws as 
"Jarant's will." 
No one knows why Jarant chose the time he did to 
make public his kingdom's sovereignty, or what he hoped 
to gain by such an act. The yuan-ti ambassadors he sent 
forth made their king's wishes clear to the nations they 
visited: leave Najaran prosperity alone, and discourage 
intruders (such as adventuring types) from violating 
Najaran borders to steal the fortunes of the serpentfolk. 
In return, the serpents promised that any caravans 
and other legitimate travelers passing through Najara's 
dominion would be unharmed and unhindered- as long 
as they don't stray from the main route. 
Reaction among the places approached raged from 
one extreme to the other. Darkhold reportedly feted 
the ambassadors well, and the serpentfolk left with not 
only an agreement from the Zhentish lords, but also an 
offer of a possible future military alliance. Not surpris-
ingly, Elturgard refused the edict outright- and in the 
process of expressing that refusal, bloodshed erupted. 
The paladins slew all but one of the ambassadors, and 
sent the survivor back to Jarant's court to communicate 
their answer. 
The other responses to the Najaran ambassadors fell 
somewhere in between. Acceptances and refusals to 
cooperate, usually polite, trickled in, but regardless of 
their substance,Jarant's goal had been accomplished: 
Najara's neighbors now saw the realm as a nation, no 
matter whether they viewed it as a potential ally or foe. 
The economy ofNajara, such as it is, depends on 
slaves to exist. Slavery is arguably the only actual trade 
conducted in Najara, with the ruins ofThlohtzin in the 
Forest ofWyrms serving as a gathering place for those 
who would stoop so low as to sell slaves to the yuan-ti. 
Different factions among the Najarans have agents 
waiting near Thlohtzin, each hoping to strike a bargain 
with slavers before others arrive. Slaves with unusual 
abilities or specialized knowledge sometimes set off 
bidding wars among the yuan-ti. I fear that such was the 
fate of that apprentice who accompanied me out of the 
High Moor. 
To everyone of any influence who might read this, 
heed my words: do not be misled. The serpents do 
not intend to coexist peacefully- they merely wish to 
use their strange diplomacy as a cloak and a shield, to 
protect them against the vigilance of others until they 
are ready to put their plans, whatever they may be, 
into fruition. 
THE COURT OF THE SERPENT KING 
I was imprisoned in Ss'khanaja, a mostly subterranean 
city on the Winding Water, where gathers the court of 
Kingjarant. 
During my time in the custody of the Najarans, I 
learned much about- and from- Dhosun Silverscale. A 
yuan-ti pureblood 'in Najara, Dhosun acts as a councilor 
to the king and often seeks to mitigatejarant's excesses. 
I believe that the sending out of the ambassadors was 
Dhosun's idea, for while I was imprisoned, he visited me 
several times, asking what I knew of the arts of embassy 
and ambassadorship. From the talk at court, Dhosun 
makes no secret of his desire to help his king build a 
nation whose status equals or outmatches other realms 
across the face of Faen1n. Jarant keeps him near, it is 
said, because of all the king's courtiers, Dhosun is the 
likeliest to attempt to steal away the Marlspire. Whether 
or not he is capable of such an act, I found the yuan-ti 
naga to be honorable- it was he who secretly arranged 
the opportunity I needed to escape, and I know he has 
done likewise for others in the past. I owe him a debt I 
intend to repay one day. 
Another figure of note in the court is the cunning 
green dragon Emikaiwufeg, often called the Emerald 
Daughter. She is young for a dragon and still small 
enough to fit in tunnels leading down to Jarant's audi-
ence chamber.Jarant is said to appreciate the twists 
and turns of her wit. Some courtiers believe that she is 
frequently kept to hand as a foil to Dhosun, as her slickly 
vicious nature offsets the Dhosun's more honorable ten-
dencies. For my part, I believe she's biding her time. A 
great many metallic dragons dwell in the Serpent Hills, 
and a clear rival for mates, wealth, and power- the 
green dragon known as Ralionate- lives in the nearby 
forest of Wyrms. 
A variety of advisors and hangers-on can be found 
withinjarant's court, which is a dangerous place. A 
trio of yuan-ti warlocks, who claim to have tapped into 
the vestiges of the ancient serpent deity once wor-
shiped at Ss'thar'tiss'ssun, leads the yuan-ti of Najara, 
though at court they frequently lurk in the background, 
simply watching. 
SERPENT HILLS 
The Serpent Hills is a desolate region of red clay hills 
and deep, treacherous ravines, featuring stretches of 
rough, ridged land surrounding tall mesas. Only scrub 
can manage to grow here, tenaciously clinging to the 
dry clay. Beneath this perilous territory- filled with 
serpents and poisonous creatures of all manner- lie the 
Serpent Ways, a series of intricate, well-guarded tunnels 
interspersed with caverns and chambers. The pas-
sages serve as the main pathways for the folk of Najara 
through these lands; indeed, it was while resting within 
such a cavern that the half-elf apprentice and I were 
captured by yuan-ti. I have since learned that in general, 
the serpents don't care who tromps over the hills, so 
long as they stay out of the places under them. The Naja-
ran capital city, Ss'khanaja, is found in the northwest 
of the Serpent Hills, but an even larger population of 
snakefolk live beneath the surface. It is common to find 
settlements inside the large underground chambers 
connected by the tunnels, excavations many centu-
ries in age. 
MARSH OF CHELIMBER 
I didn't have occasion to travel to Chelimber before my 
"sojourn" with the Narajan court, but I did ask Dhosun 
about the place. It was through those questions that 
he divined my intention to escape, in fact, and offered 
his aid. A vast marshland pocked with sulfurous pools 
that often gout their steaming contents high into the 
air, the marsh is inhospitable even to most serpents;
