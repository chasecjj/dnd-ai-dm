the North are unsettled. Rangers are driven to explore 
these lands, searching for fertile soil in which the seeds 
of civilization might grow, seeking resources (such as 
metals) that will benefit settled lands, or rooting out evil 
before it can spread. Other rangers spy on enemy troops 
or hunt down dangerous beasts or criminals. Given that 
so much of the North is frontier, rangers play a critical 
role in keeping communities safe and are often admired 
within them. 
HUMAN RANGERS 
Human rangers of the Moonshaes are devoted to the 
Earthmother, and those that work closely with druid 
circles on the mainland often honor the gods of the 
First Circle, but most rangers among humans favor the 
goddess Mielikki. However, they consider the goddess 
too wild and primal for them to pray to directly. Instead, 
they pray to Gwaeron Windstrom to bring their words to 
the goddess. Gwaeron is said to sleep in a grove of trees 
west of the town of Triboar, and most of his followers 
travel to that place at least once in their lives as a holy 
pilgrimage. Evil human rangers usually honor Malar for 
his ferocity and hunting skill. 
ELF RANGERS 
Elf rangers are usually associated with a particular 
community such as Evereska or the tribes in the Misty 
Forest. Rather than being wandering explorers, elf 
rangers typically act as scouts and guardians of elven 
realms. Such elves usually devote themselves to Rilli-
fane Rallathil or Solonor Thelandria. Elf rangers driven 
to roam might instead favor Fenmarel Mestarine, god of 
lone wanderers, or Shevarash, elven god of vengeance. 
HALFLING RANGERS 
Most halfiings who revere nature and its raw beauty 
come from lightfoot stock. Their bands spend at least as 
much time on the road and river as in village and town, 
and the role of a ranger is a natural fit with the lifestyle 
of most lightfoots. Lightfoot rangers tend to favor the 
god Brandobaris in his aspect as patron of exploration. 
Halfiings more inclined toward nature itself typically 
prefer Sheela Peryroyl. Those who devote themselves 
more to the protection of settlements or travelers honor 
Arvoreen. The few strongheart halfiings who become 
rangers tend to favor those latter two deities. 
DWARF RANGERS 
Most dwarves prefer to hunker down under a mountain, 
rather than roam the wilderness of the surface or the 
Underdark. Most often, a dwarf ranger is either a shield 
dwarf cast out of a clanhold or a clanless dwarf seeking 
a place in the world. Sometimes dwarf rangers are pros-
pectors who explore the world seeking new veins of ore. 
In any case, there are two deities who appeal to such 
dwarves: Marthammor Duin and Dumathoin. 
ROGUES 
There are those whose abilities lie not with sword or the 
Art, but with quiet motion, dexterous action, and stealth. 
Such talents often lead to illegal endeavors, which 
plague most major cities, but can be placed to good use 
in dealing with dangerous monsters and lost treasure. 
Most large cities in the Realms have a number of 
thieves' dens that compete with one another. A few 
places, such as Baldur's Gate, have an organized group 
of rogues that controls all such activity. Most thieves' 
dens are secret gathering spots, often beneath the city, 
and move after they're discovered. 
The city of Waterdeep had once been home to the 
most powerful guild of thieves in the North: the Shadow 
Thieves. The Lords ofWaterdeep smashed that guild, 
forcing its leaders to flee the city (the group still oper-
ates out of Arnn). There are still thieves and even assas-
sins in Waterdeep, but they are broken into innumerable 
small groups or operate alone. 
The most common respite for such robbers is what 
they call the Honest Trade- adventuring, where rogu-
ish abilities may be used without censure and are later 
lionized in song and legend. Many thieves take to this 
life, adhering to a code that keeps them out of trouble in 
civilized areas but still keeps them rich; they vow to bur-
glarize ancient tombs and monstrous lairs instead of the 
homes and businesses of the wealthy in civilized lands.
