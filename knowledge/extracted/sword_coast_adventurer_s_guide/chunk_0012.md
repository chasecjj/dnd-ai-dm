In 882 DR, a village and trading post on the shore of a 
deep bay in the shadow of a great mountain was named 
Nimoar's Hold, after the Uthgardt chieftain who claimed 
the area and fortified it. The place became known to sea 
captains as "Waterdeep," a name that displaced the orig-
inal within a few generations. In 1032 DR, Ahghairon, 
heir to the arts of Netheril, saved the city from itself by 
unseating Waterdeep's warlord and would-be emperor, 
Raurlor. Ahghairon declared that wisdom, not strength 
of arms, would rule in the city from now on, and created 
the Lords of Waterdeep. 
These and other nations and great city-states rose to 
prominence along the Sword Coast, forming a chain 
along the Trade Way from Illusk in the far north to 
Baldur's Gate in the south, near the borders of Arnn. 
Like their elven and dwarven predecessors, they fought 
off attacks by savage humanoids, including ore hordes 
from the Spine of the World. Waterdeep, guided by its 
mysterious Lords, became a rising power, while old 
Illusk fell to the ores for decades, until it was eventually 
reclaimed and the city of Luskan built upon its ruins. 
THE PRESENT AGE 
The four and a half centuries since the establishment of 
the Lords of Waterdeep have been tumultuous times for 
the Sword Coast and the world. Throughout this period, 
civilization struggles against the savage forces of chaos, 
and life attempts to persevere against the agents of death 
and strife, sometimes in places where even the gods 
themselves have not been exempt from destruction. 
The last one hundred fifty years have comprised one 
of the most cataclysmic periods in Faeriln's history. On 
no fewer than three occasions, Tori! has been shaken to 
its core by forces that have repeatedly rewritten the laws 
of reality. 
THE TIME OF TROUBLES 
In 1358 DR, the gods were cast out of their otherworldly 
domain and made to wander the land incarnated as 
mortals. In seeking to recover their divinity, they warred 
among themselves. Magic became unpredictable, and 
the prayers of the faithful went unanswered. Some of 
the gods-turned-mortal were slain, while a handful of 
mortals ascended to godhood, assuming the responsibil-
ities of the dead deities. 
THE RETURN OF NETHERIL 
In 1374 DR, the Empire of Netheril rose again when the 
floating city of Thultanthar, commonly known as Shade, 
returned from a nearly two-thousand-year-long excur-
sion in the Shadowfell, to hover above the Anauroch 
desert. The shadow-touched nobles of the city almost 
immediately began hunting for ancient Netherese ruins 
and artifacts and preparing for a restoration of their 
once-great empire. 
THE SPELLPLAGUE 
In 1385 DR, the ascended deity Cyric, aided by Shar, 
murdered Mystra, the goddess of magic, in her domain 
of Dweomerheart. This act ripped asunder the fabric 
of magic in the world, unleashing its raw power in a 
catastrophe called the Spell plague. Thousands of prac-
titioners of the Art were driven mad or killed, while the 
face of Faeriln was reshaped by waves and veils of mys-
tic blue fire. Entire nations were displaced or exchanged 
with realms from other worlds, and parts of the earth 
were torn free to float in the air. 
THE SECOND SUNDERING 
A century after the S pellplague, the lands and peoples of 
Faeriln had become accustomed to the state of things-
just in time for everything to change again. 
The first indication of new turmoil came in 1482 DR, 
when Bhaal, the long-dead god of murder, was reborn 
in Baldur's Gate amid chaos and bloodshed, leaving two 
of the city's dukes and many of its citizens dead. The 
return of Bhaal and his apparent reclamation of the do-
main of murder from Cyric led some scholars and sages 
to believe that the rules by which all deities must abide 
were in flux. 
In 1484, strange calamities began to occur through-
out Faeriln. An earthquake struck Iriaebor. A plague 
of locusts afflicted Arnn. Droughts gripped the south-
ern lands as the sea steadily receded in places. Amid 
this tumult, conflict broke out in many regions of the 
continent. The ores of Many-Arrows warred against 
the dwarfholds of the North and their allies. Sembia 
invaded the Dalelands, and Cormyr raised an army to 
come to the aid of the Dalesfolk. Netheril brought forces 
to Cormyr's border, and Cormyr was drawn into a war 
on both fronts. 
Throughout this period, tales began to spread of indi-
viduals who had been touched by the gods and granted 
strange powers. Some of these so-called Chosen were 
at the root of the conAicts that grip the land. Some 
seemed driven by divine purpose, while others claimed 
to be mystified as to why they would be singled out. 
In 1485, in Icewind Dale, the Chosen of Auril foments 
war with Ten-Towns and was defeated. In Anauroch, 
seeing that Netherese forces were spread thin, the 
long-subjugated Bedine people rebelled. Having de-
feated or besieged the dwarfholds of the North, ores 
march on Silverymoon. In Cormyr and Sembia, the 
Netherese and the Cormyreans traded ground, while the 
Dalelands became a war zone. As if to offset the drought 
in the south, in the autumn of 1485 the Great Rain be-
gan to fall around the Sea of Fallen Stars and continued 
unceasingly. 
While the waters rose to the east in early 1486, the 
tide turned against the ores in the North, and by the 
end of the year their armies were broken and scattered. 
Also during that year, the elves of Myth Drannor came 
to the aid of the Dalelands and helped push back Sem-
bian forces. On the Sword Coast, the Hosttower of the 
Arcane rose again in Luskan, along with the Arcane 
Brotherhood. In Waterdeep and Neverwinter, efforts 
were made to clear those cities of century-old rubble 
and neglect. Cormyr repulsed the last of the Sembian 
and Netherese forces from the nation, reclaiming its ter-
ritory, and recalled its forces, turning inward to address 
issues of rebuilding. 
Late in 1486, the Great Rain finally abated, but this 
event didn't signify an end to the chaos. The Sea of
