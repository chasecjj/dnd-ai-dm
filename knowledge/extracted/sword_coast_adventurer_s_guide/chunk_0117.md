Monks of Ilmater often travel as wanderers, begging 
for alms, seeking enlightenment, and relieving the suf-
fering of others. They tend to follow the Way of the Open 
Hand, as described in the Monastic Tradition class fea-
ture in the Player's Handbook. 
.THE SUN SOULS 
The Sun Soul monks follow a monastic tradition that 
they believe has its roots in the ancient empire of Neth-
eril. In their philosophy, living things harbor a fragment 
of the sun's mystic essence within them. Just as the body 
has a shadow, so too does the spirit have a light. That 
light is called the sun soul. Brothers and sisters of the 
Order of the Sun Soul train to tap into the "spiritual 
light within" and manifest it as supernatural feats of 
prowess and endurance. Members of this order follow 
the Way of the Sun Soul, which is described in the "Mo-
nastic Traditions" section below. 
To get in touch with their internal light, Sun Soul 
monks follow a strict code of ascetic conduct called the 
Precepts of Incandescence. It emphasizes three pillars: 
Seek physical perfection. To open the way for the 
sun soul to manifest, one should strive to make the 
body beautiful. Fitness, cleanliness, and well-honed 
physicality create a clearer window through which the 
light can shine. 
Seek spiritual virtue. Recognize the light in others, not 
just the darkness. Grant and take each new chance to 
be virtuous. 
Shine light into darkness. Share the soul's light with 
the world. Light up dark places with your presence 
and banish shadow. 
Due to the precepts' similarity to the teachings of 
some faiths, the Order of the Sun Soul has long had 
associations with temples and the faithful of three par-
ticular deities: Sune, SelQne, and Lathander. The dictate 
to seek physical perfection and recognize hidden virtue 
has similarity to Sune's teachings about physical and 
spiritual beauty. Followers of SelQne recognize their 
goddess's exhortation to battle darkness and seek vir-
tue. And of course, Lathander's association with the sun 
links to the Sun Soul philosophy, but more critically for 
worshipers of Lathander, they see the idea of granting 
and taking new chances as similar to Lathander's em-
phasis on new beginnings. 
LONG DEATH MONKS 
Followers of the Way of the Long Death worship the 
principle of death more so than any deity of death. 
These monks seek the secrets of life by studying death 
itself. It is the condition of being dead that concerns 
them most, and not what lies beyond; the afterlife holds 
little interest for them. Their monasteries are full of 
decaying, dying, and dead animal and plant specimens, 
which they study with detached interest. They frequently 
purchase rare specimens from adventurers and mer-
chants that they can't obtain easily themselves. But such 
studies are only part of the monks' daily life: They seek 
to understand death as it pertains especially to intelli-
gent living beings, and to this end they eagerly welcome 
the diseased and the dying so that they might watch and 
CHAPTER 4 I CLASSES 
record their deaths. If such unfortunates seek release 
from pain through death, the monks provide it. They 
view death as a gift that they bestow on those who are 
ready for it. Their means of determining readiness vary 
from one sect (or even one monk) to another. 
The monks suffer no moral qualms about these deeds, 
for death is the most natural thing in the world, from 
their perspective, and to expire in service to its principle 
is one of the most profoundly holy experiences a living 
being can hope to enjoy. It is for this reason that the 
monks themselves do not fear death. 
Most of the order's members are either scholars who 
share mutual fascination with death and dying or clergy 
who worship one of the deities concerned with death. 
Some of the monks consider themselves to be nothing 
less than visionaries whose work will pave the way for 
a better future for all FaerQn. When death is truly un-
derstood, it can be harnessed and used as a tool for the 
betterment of all, or so they rationalize to themselves. 
Monks of this tradition follow the Way of the Long 
Death, which is described in the "Monastic Traditions" 
section below. 
THE YIELDING WAY 
The monastic order of Eldath is the Disciples of the 
Yielding Way, sometimes known as the Brothers and 
Sisters of the Open Palm. These monks guard sacred 
sites where many priests dwell, and they travel the coun-
tryside gathering information for isolated groves and 
fastnesses. They don't ever seek to provoke violence, 
but are quite deadly when defending themselves, their 
charges, and their holy sites. 
MONASTIC TRADITIONS 
Monks in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Monastic Tradition options, in addition to those in the 
Player's Handbook. 
WAY OF THE LONG DEATH 
Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with 
the meaning and mechanics of dying. They capture 
creatures and prepare elaborate experiments to capture, 
record, and understand the moments of their demise. 
They then use this knowledge to guide their understand-
ing of martial arts, yielding a deadly fighting style. 
TOUCH OF DEATH 
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, 
your study of death allows you to extract vitality from an-
other creature as it nears its demise. When you reduce 
a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain 
temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + 
your monk level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). 
HOUR OF REAPING 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to unsettle or terrify 
those around you as an action, for your soul has been 
touched by the shadow of death. When you take this ac-
tion, each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you 
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be fright-
ened of you until the end of your next turn.
