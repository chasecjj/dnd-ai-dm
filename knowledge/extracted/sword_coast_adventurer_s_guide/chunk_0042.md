RUINED KINGDOMS OF THE NORTH 
Many folk consider the start of civilization in the North to 
be marked by the founding ofWaterdeep. More learned 
folk are aware of the deeper history of the region , and 
know of at least some of the kingdoms that have been 
built by the residents of the North down the centuries. 
Ruins of these kingdoms are scattered throughout the 
North, and many present-day cities and towns are built 
atop their remains, sometimes with their residents igno-
rant of what lies just beneath their boots. 
Eaerlann. The elven kingdom of Eaerlann, a survivor of 
the ancient Crown Wars, stretched from the High Forest to 
the Delimbiyr Vale. Weakened by the retreat of much of its 
populace to Evermeet and by ore attacks, Eaerlann finally 
fell six hundred years ago to the demons that burst forth 
from Ascalhorn (once known as Hellgate Keep and now as 
Hellgate Dell). 
11/efarn. Ten thousand years ago, the capital city of llle-
farn occupied the site where Waterdeep stands today. A 
kingdom of elves that accepted both humans and dwarves 
in its lands, lllefarn stood intact for seven millennia. It was 
eventually fragmented by increasing human settlement of 
the area, and repeated ore attacks spelled its doom. 
Athalantar. The short-lived human kingdom of Athalan-
tar lay south of the High Forest in territory claimed by 
its self-styled Stag King thirteen centuries ago. Its rulers 
were briefly supplanted by magelords, but then reclaimed 
the throne, only to be wiped out by ores within a few 
generations. 
Phalorm. Dwarf, elf, and human monarchs all shared 
the rule of Phalorm, also known as the Realm of Three 
Crowns, which was founded nearly a thousand years ago 
in the High Moor. Phalorm lasted barely a century before 
repeated ore and goblin attacks overcame it. 
Kingdom of Man. When Phalorm fell, the surviving hu-
mans of the kingdom established the Kingdom of Man, 
formally known as Delimbiyran, which lasted only two 
generations. Its dissolution left behind a number of petty 
"kingdoms" that welcomed new human settlers in several 
locations, leading to the founding of new cities and towns 
on the Sword Coast and in its environs. 
Netheril. For centuries, the legend of Netheril served 
as a lesson of human hubris and a lure for treasure hunt-
ers too prideful to learn from its story. Long before the 
Dales Compact and the advent of Dalereckoning, Netheril 
arose as a human empire founded on the might of magic 
learned from the golden Nether Scrolls, artifacts at least 
as old as the creator races. Flying Netherese cities drifted 
through the skies all over the North, but primarily they 
hung high over a verdant land that is now the desert 
of Anauroch. 
Then Karsus, one of the mighty mages of Netheril, dared 
to believe that he could wrest control of the Weave and 
become a god himself. He almost succeeded, but in his 
failure Karsus killed the goddess of magic, shredded the 
Weave, and sent the floating enclaves that couldn't flee to 
other planes crashing to the ground. From the moments 
after the crash when the spilt blood was still fresh to the 
present day's moss-covered or dune-buried stones, the ru-
ins of Netheril and its arcane secrets have drawn many to 
their doom. 
or Baldur's Gate. Lady Belinda Anteos (of the Water-
deep noble house) promises that her business is secure 
and that the bank's magical means of communicating 
precise amounts of currency between cities can't be 
tampered with. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE SWORD COAST AND THE NORTH 
Members of local guilds that do business outside the 
town don't entirely trust the Traders' Bank, preferring 
instead to borrow coin from the Hardcheese family of 
halfiings that run the Happy Cow tavern. The Alliance 
officially has no preference, but I find Lady Anteos trust-
worthy enough to be an alternative to carrying large 
sums on the road. It's easier to part with a small portion 
of one's purse than to lose everything to a band of brig-
ands during a journey through the wilds. 
Visitors to Daggerford are advised both to avoid the 
tannery to the west and to swiftly cross Tyndal's Bridge 
when approaching from the south. The tannery's loca-
tion, up on the hill, does little to contain the stink of the 
process, and the Watermen's Guild dumps the city's 
waste over the side of the bridge. On hot days, the scents 
exuded from both sites can be overwhelming, which is 
why I have again asked the Alliance to assign a different 
agent to visit on next summer's rounds. 
Tyndal's Bridge is a low stone structure over which 
travelers pass when approaching from the west, where 
a local boy named Tyndal held off a number of lizard-
folk with only a dagger. He grew to manhood, married 
the local ruler's daughter, named himself duke, and 
built Daggerford atop the ruins of an older castle. This 
story, and most of the area's history, is happily related 
to any who ask by Sir Darfin Floshin, an elf older than 
Daggerford itself. He longs to see a rise in cooperation 
between humans, dwarves, and elves in the region, such 
as was once embodied in the realm of Phalorm. Darfin 
has been advisor to many dukes of Daggerford through 
the yea.rs. Though he was rebuffed by Duke Maldwyn 
during his reign, there are signs that Lady Morwen may 
be more receptive to the advice of a gold elf who has wit-
nessed the fall of the human kingdom of Delimbiyran, 
the founding of Daggerford, and all the days since. 
LONGSADDLE 
The hamlet of Longsaddle is little more than a row of 
buildings on either side of the Long Road, halfway along 
the lengthy journey from Triboar to Mirabar. A path 
leaves the road here and winds to the Ivy Mansion, the 
great house of the wizards of the Harpell family. Since 
the Harpells founded the town more than four centuries 
ago, they have brooked little nonsense and less mayhem. 
Their own behavior sometimes borders on the bizarre 
and can be disturbing- they once turned two rival sects 
of Malarites into rabbits for disturbing Longsaddle with 
their squabbles, leaving them at the mercy of the pred-
ators they had honored- but they are one of the most 
potent gatherings of mages anywhere in the North. 
The Harpells are a jovial, if insular, lot. All wizards, 
they tend to marry wizards as well, and the elder women 
of the family (by blood or marriage) set the course 
for the house and utterly rule matters within the Ivy 
Mansion. The family takes on a number of apprentice 
wizards, using them for menial tasks and for basic 
defense of Longsaddle. Some apprentices are often the 
inadvertent test subjects for an experimental spell, but 
such is the danger of apprenticing to the Harpells. It 
is likely this spirit of experimentation that caused the 
Harpells to found their town so far away from other 
settlements. Young wizards with oddly sized or shaped
