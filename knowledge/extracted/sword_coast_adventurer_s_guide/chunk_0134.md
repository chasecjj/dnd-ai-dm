stance against unauthorized involvement with other 
nations and organizations. You might have been exiled 
for breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws, 
or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the 
gods of magic. 
Kara-Tur. The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of 
Faen1n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar 
to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, 
the people of Faerfin likely refer to you as Shou, even if 
that isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanket 
term they use for everyone who shares your origin. 
The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerfin as 
diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous 
merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of 
some such delegation, then decided to stay when the 
mission was over. 
Mulhorand. From the terrain to the architecture to 
the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly every-
thing about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the 
Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of 
culture shock when you left your desert home and trav-
eled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerfin. Recent 
events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slav-
ery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between 
Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerfin. 
Those who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering des-
erts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different 
life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North 
simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, 
or because you have made too many enemies among the 
desert communities of your home. 
Sossal. Few have heard of your homeland, but many 
have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from 
Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and 
white hair, and typically dressed in white. 
Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against 
the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other 
sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the 
Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort 
to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing 
reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek 
something incredibly important. 
Zakhara. As the saying goes among those in Faerfin 
who know of the place, "To get to Zakhara, go south. 
Then go south some more." Of course, you followed an 
equally long route when you came north from your place 
of birth. Though it isn't unusual for Zakharans to visit 
the southern extremes of Faerfin for trading purposes, 
few of them stray as far from home as you have. 
You might be traveling to discover what wonders are 
to be found outside the deserts and sword-like moun-
tains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrim-
age to understand the gods that others worship, so that 
you might better appreciate your own deities. 
The Underdark. Though your home is physically 
closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations dis-
cussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one 
of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its 
own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one 
of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are 
probably a member of the race that occupies the place-
but you might also have grown up there after being cap-
tured and brought below when you were a child. 
If you are a true Underdark native, you might have 
come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or 
perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior 
(whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your 
reason for leaving "home" probably has something to do 
with getting away from a bad situation. 
FEATURE: ALL EYES ON You 
Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and per-
haps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. 
Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, 
which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly 
interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, 
to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear 
stories of your homeland. 
You can parley this attention into access to people 
and places you might not otherwise have, for you and 
your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and 
merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in 
hearing about your distant homeland and people.
