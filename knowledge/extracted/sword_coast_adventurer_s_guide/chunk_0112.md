CLERICS 
The gods are most active through their chosen clerics, 
who carry out the gods' work on the Material Plane. A 
typical cleric in Faerun serves a single divine patron, 
but some individuals feel called to serve a group, such 
as the elemental gods Akadi, Grumbar, Kossuth, and 
Istishia, while others serve deities that are intertwined 
gods, such as the elves' Angharradh. 
Some clerics in Faerun belong to an established 
religious hierarchy, but many do not. The gods choose 
whomever they will, and sometimes a devoted wor-
shiper is blessed with all the abilities of a cleric, despite 
not being a priest of any kind. That cleric might be a 
contemplative hermit, a wandering prophet, or simply 
a devout peasant. Religious orders often try to recruit 
such clerics and bring them into the fold, but not all of 
those clerics wish to be bound to a hierarchy. 
Conversely, not everyone who pursues a religious vo-
cation is a true cleric. Some acolytes discover a different 
path for their lives than the path of the cleric. They serve 
their faiths in other roles, such as priests, scholars, or 
artisans, while some go on to vocations that have noth-
ing to do with religion. A few souls who are denied the 
path of the cleric become embittered and seek favor with 
sinister or forbidden gods or forge pacts with other pow-
erful entities. Religious scholars in the Realms debate 
whether divine rejection led such a person to embrace a 
dark path or whether the person was rejected because 
the gods foresaw the potential for darkness in the per-
son's future. The gods remain silent on the matter. 
Some clerics are homebodies who serve a particular 
community of the faithful, but adventuring clerics tend 
to have a certain crusading zeal to do their deity's work 
in the wider world. This work may include ministering 
to far-flung communities, as well as seeking out and de-
feating threats to the civilized world. 
DIVINE DOMAIN 
Clerics in the Forgotten Realms have the following 
Divine Domain option, in addition to those in the Play-
er's Handbook. 
ARCANA DOMAIN 
Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and 
that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the 
Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic 
intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowl-
edge is a great responsibility that comes with a special 
understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of 
Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its 
wielder sees fit. 
The gods of this domain are often associated with 
knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go 
hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain in-
clude Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian 
of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain 
includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple 
moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; 
and Boccob, Vecna, and WeeJas of Greyhawk.

ARCANE INITIATE 
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain pro-
ficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips 
of your choice from the wizard spell list. For you, these 
cantrips count as cleric cantrips. 
CHANNEL DIVINITY: ARCANE ABJURATION 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity 
to abjure otherworldly creatures. 
As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one 
celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that 
is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving 
throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If 
the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 min-
ute or until it takes any damage.
