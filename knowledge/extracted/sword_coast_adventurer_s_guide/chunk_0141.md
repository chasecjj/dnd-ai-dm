to a specific dragon type. Use the tiger totem for a red 
dragon totem and the elk for a silver dragon totem. 
CLERIC 
The Arcana Domain maps to the portfolios overseen by 
Aureon of the Sovereign Host and the Shadow from the 
Dark Six. Blood of Vol cultists who are clerics can also 
take this domain. 
FIGHTER 
With the Last War in the recent past, the Purple Dragon 
Knight's role as a combat leader can apply to any fighter 
who served in one of Khorvaire's militaries as an officer. 
Soldiers from Karrnath, with its strong martial tradi-
tion, are especially likely to choose this option. 
MONK 
The Way of the Long Death captures the cruel and sinis-
ter nature of monks devoted to the Mockery. In contrast, 
the Way of the Sun Soul is the perfect option for monks 
dedicated to the Silver Flame, especially those who also 
take levels in the paladin class. 
PALADIN 
The Oath of the Crown represents paladins who place 
loyalty to their sovereign ruler above all other concerns. 
The military tradition of Karrnath produces paladins 
who take this oath, especially those whose fanaticism 
leads them to join the Order of the Emerald Claw. 
ROGUE 
Both the Mastermind and the Swashbuckler are per-
fectly at home in the city of Sham. In addition, the ranks 
of the dragonmarked houses are filled with scheming, 
adventurous entrepreneurs best captured by the Master-
mind's abilities. 
While the Mastermind lacks a specific ability in inves-
tigation, pairing it with the right skill selections and abil-
ity scores (a high Wisdom is a must) yields a good model 
for an inquisitive. 
SORCERER 
Storm Sorcery is a natural match for House Lyrandar. 
Drawing on the power conferred by that house's dragon-
mark, a Lyrandar storm sorcerer can help guide ships 
through the air and across the sea. Such sorcerers are 
likely elite members of the house, since they can guaran-
tee safe passage through dangerous weather. 
WARLOCK 
The elves of Aerenal are an ideal match for the Undying. 
Some of these elves enter pacts with their deathless 
ancestors, pledging service and obedience in return for 
ancient secrets of the elves that unlock magical powers, 
as well as mastery over the undead. 
WIZARD 
Bladesingers can be found in Aundair, serving as spe-
cially trained agents of the Arcane Congress. Bladesing-
APPENDIX I CLASS OPTIONS IN OTHER WORLDS 
ers are specifically tasked with protecting the congress's 
secrets and ensuring that they never fall into the wrong 
hands. At times, they are dispatched to distant lands 
in search of magic items long thought lost or to deal 
with nascent, magical threats before they grow too 
dangerous. 
GREYHAWK 
Use the following guidelines to adapt this book's class 
options to a campaign set on Oerth. 
BARBARIAN 
Barbarians are common throughout the northern 
reaches of Oerik. From the lands of the Wolf Nomads 
to the enclaves of the Ice Barbarians, these characters 
venture south in search of loot, glory, and power. Others 
are exiles, forced to leave their homeland under pen-
alty of death. 
The Path of the Battlerager lacks a direct analog on 
Oerth. Most likely, a battlerager could be of any race 
and formerly trained as a pit fighter by the vicious Slave 
Lords. The Slave Lords are a much-feared cabal who 
direct raids on seaside communities, carrying off pris-
oners to a wretched life of servitude. A battlerager might 
be one such unfortunate victim. A prisoner who shows 
signs of martial aptitude might be trained in an exotic 
fighting style sure to fetch a high price from a blood-
thirsty buyer. 
The tiger totem is an easy match for barbarians who 
hail from the realm of the Tiger Nomads. The elk totem 
is most common among the Rovers of the Barrens, pre-
serving an ancient Flan tradition. 
CLERIC 
The Arcana Domain is a perfect match for clerics of 
Boccob. They are charged with using their abilities to 
seek out lost magic items and to help counter the slow 
but relentless disappearance of magic from Oerth. 
FIGHTER 
The Purple Dragon Knight's focus on combat leadership 
makes it the ideal model for the Knights of the Watch. 
Charged with protecting the lands of Bissel, Gran 
March, Geoff, and Keoland from Baklunish incursions, 
these knights combine strict discipline, a near-monastic 
way of life, and ample study of battle tactics and strategy 
to remain vigilant against attack. 
MONK 
Monks are relatively rare on Oerth, with the notable ex-
ception of the sinister Scarlet Brotherhood. 
Among the Scarlet Brotherhood, the Way of the Long 
Death is a secretive technique taught to those who com-
bine the brotherhood's expertise in unarmed fighting 
with its preference for assassination to remove trouble-
some enemies. 
The Way of the Sun Soul is a perfect fit for monks 
who worship Pholtus or Pelor. The monastic orders 
among the Baklunish lands could easily yield an order 
of monks dedicated to Al'Akbar.
