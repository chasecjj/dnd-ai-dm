HALF-ELVES 
An elf who looks upon a half-elf sees a human, and a hu-
man who beholds the same person sees an elf. Though 
this characterization is simplistic, it gets to the heart of 
what it means to be a half-elf in Faerftn. 
To elves who have an extreme viewpoint on the mat-
ter, half-elves are emblematic of the decline of elven civi-
lization, a dilution of the race's heritage and culture that 
will lead to its eventual dissolution. To the humans at 
the other end of the spectrum, half-elves have an unfair 
advantage over their fully human peers, and are seen 
as privileged or favored regardless of the actual circum-
stances of their birth. 
For most folk in Faerftn, the issue isn't so cut and 
dried. Half-elves are generally tolerated wherever they 
go, or wherever they take up residence- with the proviso 
that a society that doesn't look kindly on elves or hu-
mans is likely to feel the same way about someone who 
has the blood of both races. Conversely, a society that 
holds humans or elves in high esteem doesn't usually 
bestow the same status on half-elves (though such indi-
viduals are generally not ostracized). 
YOUNG RAC~ 
OLD ROOTS 
In the distant past, half-elves were scarce because 
humans and elves came into contact only infrequently. 
The ancient elven kingdoms of Cormanthyr and Myth 
Drannor had significant populations of half-elves. It is 
CHAPTER 3 I RACES OF THE REALMS 
only in the past thousand years or so, as the races have 
intermingled more and more, that the number of half-
elves has increased so that they are now found through-
out Faerftn. 
Not surprisingly, half-elves enjoy the company of 
others of their kind, such that where half-elves congre-
gate, they are likely to be joined by others. Most of the 
half-elves in the North and along the Sword Coast are 
of moon elf heritage mixed with Illuskan or Tethyrian 
blood. In other parts of Faerftn, half-elves have signif-
icant communities in the Yuirwood and throughout 
Aglarond. Aquatic half-elves are found along the coasts, 
including near Aglarond, the Dragon Coast, Impiltur, 
Sembia, and the Vilhon Reach. Drow half-elves are 
most numerous in the nation of Dambrath, which was 
conquered by the dark elves years ago, and in the Un-
derdark, where House Ousstyl of Menzoberranzan is 
particularly infamous for having mated with humans. 
MIXED HERITAGE 
Half-elves are a diverse lot, given the number of combi-
nations of elf subraces and human ethnicities in their 
ranks. Most of them consider their dual nature a bless-
ing more than a disadvantage, because it gives them a 
set of capabilities and a perspective on the world that 
full-blooded humans and elves can't hope to match. 
At the same time, the mixed heritage of half-elves 
dictates that they make an effort to fit in with humans 
or elves when possible. For instance, half-elves born 
and raised in human settlements tend to have human 
names, while half-elves in elven communities generally 
have elven names. In some places half-elf children are 
named according to the "other" parent, or with a mix of 
human and elven names, as a way of setting half-elves 
apart from the rest of their community. 
Half-elves speak both Common and Elvish. In addi-
tion, half-elves from the Yuirwood commonly speak 
Aglarondan. 
Half-elves in Faerftn have the racial traits of half-elves 
in the Player's Handbook, although some variations are 
possible; see the "Half-Elf Variants" sidebar. 
THE Gans OF Two PEOPLES 
There are no half-elven gods, so half-elves follow el-
ven or human deities of their choosing-although just 
as many religious half-elves believe that their gods 
choose them. Half-elves often revere the gods of the 
culture in which they were raised, although some rebel 
HALF-ELF VARIANTS 
Some half-elves in FaerOn have a racial trait in place of 
the Skill Versatility trait. If your DM allows it, your half-elf 
character can forgo Skill Versatility and instead take the elf 
trait Keen Senses or a trait based on your elf parentage: 
• A half-elf of wood elf descent can choose the wood elf's 
Elf Weapon Training, Fleet of Foot, or Mask of the Wild. 
• A half-elf of moon elf or sun elf descent can choose the 
high elf's Elf Weapon Training or Cantrip. 
• A half-elf of drow descent can choose the drow's 
Drow Magic. 
A half-elf of aquatic heritage can choose a swimming 
speed of 30 feet.
