their kin in favor of living close to nature. Wood elves 
have not claimed a large realm of their own since the 
kingdom of Eaerlann was destroyed millennia ago. 
Instead they maintain a number of smaller settlements, 
the better to keep those communities hidden or pro-
tected. Wood elves claim territory in the High Forest, 
the Great Dale, the Western Heartlands, and beyond. 
Some wood elves live in other elven communities 
and territories, where they serve as scouts, rangers, 
and hunters. 
Despite seeing themselves as part of the world, wood 
elves don't commonly emerge from their homes to 
encounter non-elves. Likewise, in the deep woods and 
forests of the world, most wood elves don't come across 
members of other races. Adventurers, diplomats, couri-
ers, and those who pursue similar professions are the 
exceptions, traveling far outside their sylvan domains 
and meeting a wide variety of folk. 
Wood elves in Faerfin have the racial traits of wood 
elves in the Player's Handbook. They have tan or 
coppery skin, with hair of wood brown, golden blond, 
black, or a shining metallic copper, and eyes of green, 
brown, or hazel. 
Skilled naturalists, wood elves often take up profes-
sions that allow them to remain close to the wild or to 
make use of their knowledge of woodcraft, wildlife, and 
forestry. Wood elves are more than capable in warfare, 
particularly archery. They are less magically inclined 
than their cousins, but have their fair share of practi-
tioners of the Art, as well as clerics and many druids. 
DARK ELVES (DROW) 
The drow are descended from the dark elves who 
retreated into the Underdark after the Crown Wars. 
They are infamous for their cruelty, evilness, and drive 
to dominate. 
For much of history, many believed that all drow were 
beings of inherent and irredeemable evil. In truth, most 
drow do align with evil, engaging in torture, slavery, 
murder, and other nefarious activities in the name of 
their demon-goddess. Almost always, dark elves who 
reject the ways of their people are exiled, or executed 
for being rebels, heretics, and insurrectionists who have 
turned against drow culture and the will of Lolth. But 
the existence of noble and self-sacrificing drow such as 
Liriel Baenre and Drizzt Do'Urden suggests that the evil 
of the drow isn't innate and can be overcome. The ac-
tions of these few heroic drow have tempered some peo-
ple's opinions toward the race, although the appearance 
of a dark elf on the surface remains a rare event and a 
cause for alarm. 
Many drow in Faerun hail from Menzoberranzan, the 
infamous City of Spiders, or one of the other drow city-
states in the Underdark, such asJhachalkhyn or Ched 
Nasad. Dark elves encountered on the surface are usu-
ally found near entrances to the Underdark, because 
they are harmed by the light of day, which weakens 
them and their magic. Drow who become adventurers 
often do so after fleeing the oppressive, cruel theoc-
racy of the city-states. Most of these individuals live as 
outcasts and wanderers, though a rare few find new 
homes with another race or culture. 
Drow have the racial traits of dark elves in the Player's 
Handbook. Drow characters can come from any back-
ground, though most have a history that links to one of 
the drow city-states of the Underdark. 
Inherent magical abilities and a preference for dark 
places make drow naturally adept as assassins, thieves, 
and spies. Traditionally, male drow are warriors and 
wizards, and female drow occupy leadership roles as 
warriors or priestesses of Lolth. Drow exiles tend to fol-
low their own path regardless of gender. 
ELVEN DEITIES 
The gods of the Tel'Quessir, collectively known as the 
Seldarine, have embodied the ideals of the elf people 
since time immemorial. They are believed to dwell in 
the realm of Arvandor on the plane of Arborea. 
GoD OF THE ELVES 
Corellon Larethian is the wise leader of the Seldarine, 
the god of elves, magic, poetry, rulership, and warcraft. 
He is thought of as the father of the race, but he is de-
picted as female as often as he is depicted as male. 
GODDESS OF WISDOM 
Angharradh, triune goddess of wisdom and the fierce 
mother-protector of the elf people, is Corellon's consort. 
Her three aspects are: Aerdrie Faenya, wild goddess of 
the winds and weather, as well as patron of the avariel; 
Hanali Celani!, the Winsome Rose, goddess of love,
