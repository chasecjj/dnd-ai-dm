D EATHLOCK M AST ERMIND 
Though deathlocks exist to serve their patrons, they 
retain some freedom when it comes to devising par-
ticular tactics and carrying out their plans. Powerful 
deathlocks recruit lesser creatures to help them carry 
out their missions and, in this capacity, become the mas-
terminds behind vast conspiracies and intrigues that 
culminate in the accomplishment of great acts of evil.

Spellcasting. The deathlock is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spell-

target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3 necrotic damage). 
Crave Bolts. Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one 
or two targets. Hit: 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. If the target is 
Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving 
throw or become restrained as shadowy tendrils wrap around it 
for 1 minute. A restrained target can use its action to repeat the 
saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
D EATH LO CK WIGH T 
Bereft of much of its magic, a deathlock wight lingers

succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point 
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. 
This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The tar-
get dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. 
A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zom-
bie under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is restored 
to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more 
than twelve zombies under its control at one time.
