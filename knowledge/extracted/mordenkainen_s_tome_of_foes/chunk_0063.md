ABBA THOR 
The Great Master of Greed exerts an influence, no 
matter how subtle, over every dwarven heart. Abbathor 
teaches that greed isn't only desirable, but necessary to 
keep the dwarves in a strong and safe position. 
Abbathor has no skill in crafting. Instead, he relies on 
his ability as a thief to take ownership of what he wants. 
Why work so hard to manufacture something when a 
much easier path to riches lies open? 
Abbathor is the only advocate for change within the 
dwarven pantheon. He can inspire dwarves to seek 
shortcuts, normally frowned upon, but sometimes those 
methods turn out to be efficient techniques that improve 
a clan's capabilities. 
BERRONAR T'RUESILVER 
The Matron of Home and Hearth is the patron of family, 
honor, and law. She lays out the rules for managing a 
dwarf clan. 
Berronar's code establishes the laws of the dwarves, 
including contracts, trade agreements, and every other 
kind of bond forged through words and deeds. As Mora-

din provides the example that dwarves strive to match, 
Berronar provides the bonds that create dwarven soci-
ety and culture. 
Berronar's priests arrange marriages, using a process 
that finds the best matches and is designed to ensure 
that each generation of a clan is stronger and more 
talented than the last. Their dictates in this respect are 
sacrosanct, and a dwarf designated for an arranged 
marriage must obey the priests or risk exile. 
CLANGEDDIN SILVERBEARD 
Known as the Father of Battle, Clangeddin Silverbeard 
is the patron of dwarf warriors. Impetuous and brave yet 
a cunning strategist, Clangeddin embodies the warrior's 
spirit that makes dwarven armies such formidable foes. 
Clanged din encourages dwarf warriors to venture out 
of the stronghold in search of foes to defeat. He particu-
larly hates goblinoids, giants, and dragons. He compels 
his followers to seek out and dispatch such enemies be-
fore they can become a threat to the stronghold. 
Clangeddin's faithful are mainly full-time warriors 
assigned to weapon training from an early age and ex-
pected to take the fight to the enemy. The two axes he 
wields embody his attitude, since he forsakes the added 
protection of a shield for the chance to deal more dam-
age to his enemies. 
Clangeddin's priests are warriors who lead from the 
front. When defending a stronghold, they guard the 
walls and lead sorties against enemy positions. When an 
external threat is near, the priests plan guerrilla raids to 
disrupt invaders before they can besiege the stronghold.
