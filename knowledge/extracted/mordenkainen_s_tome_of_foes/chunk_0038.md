but who have not yet begun to withdraw into themselves. 
Their duties involve guiding elves who have recently 
experienced Remembrance, and are thus beginning the 
journey into introversion in the waning days of one's 
mortal life. The priests also preside over funeral cele-
brations, since Labelas is also honored for his role in 
seeing that elves experience beneficial reincarnations. 
Eternal Witness. S hrines and temples to Labelas 
Enoreth are mostly made of or decorated with ephem-
eral things. Patterns and images made with colored 
sand, cut flowers, precariously stacked stones, and 
images made from thin paper are all commonly found 
there. These places of veneration are usually located in 
desolate, high places where the ever-changing sky and 
the setting sun can be seen and contemplated. Along 
with the setting sun, images of clouds are a major motif 
for followers of Labelas, who often tattoo such designs 
on their bodies or embroider them on their robes to sig-
nify the ephemeral nature of the physical world. 
Labelas Enoreth is the custodian of time, monitoring 
its passing and making sure that the warp and weft of 
history isn't torn asunder by powerful maniacs and er-
rant demigods. He is also the eternal witness, watching 
the souls of the elves as they dance from incarnation to 
incarnation, each mortal lifetime representing a role an 
actor would take in a play. From his cosmic perspective, 
Labelas looks on each elven life as a story to be written, 
nudging wayward souls toward incarnations that he 
deems suitable for their overall development, and thus 
weaving the life of each elven soul into a tapestry that 
spans the ages. In acknowledgment of this gift, priests 
and devotees of Labelas often weave modest tapestries 
of their own and donate them to shines in his honor. 
Despite Labelas's influence in the Seldarine, elves 
can become psychologically immersed in their mortal 
incarnations, forgetting about the tick of time and the 
eventual end of their physical forms. Even Labelas's ap-
pearance, with his obvious signs of aging, isn't enough 
to dissuade some elves from growing attached to their 
youthful features, long life, and worldly treasures. But 
all such naive behavior is brought to heel when the Re-
membrance occurs, and an elf's inward examination be-
gins as one journeys toward death and a new beginning. 
Priests of Labelas smile with compassion when these 
wide-eyed elves show up at their temples, suddenly full 
of contrition and offerings for Labelas, still shaken from 
the vision of their Remembrance and the gravity of its 
meaning. 
To enhance an elf's Remembrance, the priests of La-
belas use a special mirror made of polished black onyx. 
Small versions of these can be seen at many shrines 
dedicated to the Seldarine, as a reminder to the passing 
faithful of the importance of Remembrance. The priests 
advise those in their care to look into the mirror in order 
to deepen the trance of Remembrance. In the black void 
of the mirror, they see the faces of their former selves 
and scenes from their past lives- a glimpse into the 
grand tapestry of the each soul's existence as Labelas 
begins to weave yet another incarnation. 
RI LLIFANE R ALLATHIL 
Like the other elven deities, Rillifane Rallathil was once 
a primal elf sprung from droplets of Corellon's blood. 
CH APTER 2 I ELVES 
The original primal elves- and indeed, Corellon him-
self- have no "true form." Their common, elf-like por-
trayals are a convenience adopted after the elves took on 
permanent humanoid form. 
When the other elven deities decided on humanoid 
forms, Rillifane took a different approach. He took as his 
principal form that of an enormous oak tree, taller and 
wider than any other. Its roots are so deep and far-reach-
ing that they touch the roots of every other plant in the 
world, or so it's said. Through this network of tendrils, 
Rillifane remains aware of everything that happens in 
the forest. 
When he chooses to travel to other planes and worlds, 
Rillifane takes the appearance of an uncommonly tall 
and strong wood elf with dark skin, handsome features, 
and twigs and leaves protruding from his hair. 
In either guise, his main concerns are the welfare of 
forests and prairies, the passing of the seasons, and the 
lives of beasts. Most of his followers and priests are elf 
druids. They're just as insular and secretive as any other 
druids, which means their motives are often not clear to 
those around them. 
Energetic debates have been held over whether Rilli-
fane's oak tree exists only on Arvandor; has roots that 
extend to all worlds; is duplicated fully on every world 
that has plant life; or is only a metaphor for Rillifane's 
deep connection to nature. A growing sentiment among 
Rillifane's druids holds that the correct answer is "All of 
the above or none of the above, depending on Rillifane's 
mood." 
Roots Run Deep. Ancient trees are almost always in-
corporated into shrines to Rillifane Rallathil. Many for-
ests in elven lands have sacred groves where such trees 
stand as silent witnesses to the events of the world. At 
the base of such a tree, amid its immense, gnarled roots, 
the druids of Rillifane place their offerings. Carvings of 
animals, golden acorns, snowdrops, and sprigs of holly 
or witch hazel are all common offerings to the god of 
the passing seasons and the beasts of the forest. Often 
a shrine to Rillifane contains resting places where one 
can bend knee and meditate at the base of the great tree. 
The druids of Rillifane consider trees to be symbolic 
of the connection between the mental and the physical, 
between what is illuminated and what remains mysteri-
ous. Trunks and branches reach high into the expanse 
of the mind and the realm of revelation, while roots sink 
deep, anchoring themselves in the known and enwrap-
ping what remains hidden. When Rillifane's druids med-
itate at the site of a great tree, they can receive visions 
that afford them a new way of seeing the world. Often 
these flashes compel the devotee to undertake a quest 
to bring balance to the natural order by delivering a vital 
message or completing some other task. 
SEHANINE MOONBOW 
Sehanine is Corellon's beloved; Corellon is Sehanine's 
creator. Sehanine is Corellon's shadow; Corellon is Se-
hanine's reflection. Sehanine is the moon; Corellon is 
the moon's crescent. Sehanine is the night sky; Corellon 
is the sun and all the stars. 
No god of the Seldarine is as intertwined with Corel-
lon or presents so many paradoxes for worshipers to 
unravel, but this role befits Sehanine, for she is a god
