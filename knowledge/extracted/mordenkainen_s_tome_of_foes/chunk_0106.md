BONECLAW 
A wizard who tries to become a lich but fails might 
become a boneclaw instead. These hideous, cackling 
undead share a few of the lich's attributes-but where 
liches are immortal masters of the arcane, boneclaws 
are slaves to darkness, hatred, and pain. 
The most important part of the transformation ritual 
occurs when the soul of the aspiring lich migrates to a 
prepared phylactery. If the spellcaster is too physically 
or magically weak to compel the soul into its prison, 
the soul instead seeks out a new master-a humanoid 
within a few miles who has an unusually hate-filled 
heart. The soul bonds itself to the foul essence it finds in 
that person, and the boneclaw becomes forever enslaved 
to its new master's wishes and subconscious whims. It 
forms near its master, sometimes appearing before that 
individual to receive orders and other times simply set-
ting about the fulfillment of its master's desires. 
Limited Immortality. A boneclaw can't be destroyed 
while its master lives. No matter what happens to a 
boneclaw's body, it re-forms within hours and returns to 
whatever duty its master assigned. 
The boneclaw can serve only evil. If its master finds 
redemption or sincerely turns away from the path of evil, 
the boneclaw is permanently destroyed. 
Cacklins Slayers. Boneclaws delight in murder, and 
nothing pleases them more than causing horrific pain. 
They lurk like spiders in shadowy recesses, waiting 
for victims to approach within reach of their long, bony 
limbs. Once speared, a creature is pulled into the dark-
ness to be sliced apart or teleported elsewhere to be 
tortured to death. 
Dark Reflections. A boneclaw's master might not 
want such a servant or even know it has one. Boneclaws 
bind to petty criminals, bullies, and even particularly 
cruel children. Even if the master is unaware of its new, 
horrid bodyguard, its local area will be plagued by disap-
pearances and grisly murders, tied together by the com-
mon thread of the master's envy or hunger for revenge. 
Undead Nature. A boneclaw doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep.

body appears within l mile of the boneclaw's master. 
Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the boneclaw 
can take the Hide action as a bonus action. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The boneclaw makes two claw attacks. 
Piercing Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach l S ft., one 
target. Hit: 20 (3dl0 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a 
creature, the boneclaw can pull the target up to 10 feet toward 
itself, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). The boneclaw 
has two claws. While a claw grapples a target, the claw can at-
tack only that target. 
Shadow jump. If the boneclaw is in dim light or darkness, 
each creature of the boneclaw's choice within 5 feet of it must 
succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 34 (5dl2 
+ 2) necrotic damage. 
The boneclaw then magically teleports up to 60 feet to an 
unoccupied space it can see. It can bring one creature it's 
grappling, teleporting that creature to an unoccupied space it 
can see within 5 feet of its destination. The destination spaces 
of this teleportation must be in dim light or darkness. 
REACTIONS 
Deadly Reach. In response to a visible enemy moving into its 
reach, the boneclaw makes one claw attack against that enemy. 
If the attack hits, the boneclaw can make a second claw attack 
against the target.
