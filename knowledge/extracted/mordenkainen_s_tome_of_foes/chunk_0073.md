CHAPTER 4: 
GITH AND THEIR ENDLESS WAR 
HE STORY OF THE GITH IS ROOTED IN A CRUEL 
twist of cosmic fate. Inspired by the great 
leader for whom the race is named, the gith 
rose up to overthrow the mind flayers that 
held them in servitude. But after they won 
their freedom, two factions among the gith 
disagreed on what kind of civilization they 
would forge. That disagreement quickly flared into open 
hostility, and the two groups distanced themselves from 
one another to pursue their separate agendas. They 
remain bitter enemies today, each side willing to fight to 
the death whenever they cross paths. 
The githyanki were motivated by revenge and con-
vinced that they deserved to take whatever they wanted 
from the worlds they traveled. Ranging out from the 
titanic city ofTu'narath on the Astral Plane, they send 
raiders out to plunder the Material Plane and other 
worlds, bringing treasures and slaves back to their age-
less realm. At the same time, they hunt down and kill 
mind flayers whenever possible, as recompense for what 
the illithids did to them. 
The githzerai believed that the path to an enlightened 
civilization lay in seclusion, not conflict. Their dedi-
cation to the principles of order is so strong that they 
can manipulate the stuff of chaos and use it to their 
benefit; thus, they have carved out a stronghold for 
themselves on the plane of Limbo that is virtually im-
pervious. Though the githzerai are pacifists by nature, 
they share the githyanki's racial hatred for mind fl.ayers, 
and from time to time they send out squads to destroy 
illithid outposts. 
If the two races were ever to team up against the 
illithids, a combined force of gith could conceivably tip 
the balance in their favor. But as long as the githyanki 
and githzerai stay at each other's throats, their goal of 
ultimate victory over their original common enemy will 
likely remain unachieved. 
GITHYANKI 
S ince winning their freedom from the mind flayers, the 
githyanki have become corrupt raiders and destroyers 
under the rulership of their dread lich-queen, Vlaakith. 
They dwell on the Astral Plane in the city of Tu'narath, a 
metropolis built on and in the corpse of a deity. 
Vlaakith commands the loyalty of the githyanki from 
her personal stronghold, Susurrus, also called the 
Palace of Whispers, which is located deep inside the 
floating city. She sits on her Throne of Bones, a mighty 
artifact fueled by the intellects of mind flayers and elder 
brains that were defeated by her minions. It is crafted 
from mind flayer skulls and extremities, and the cushion 
she sits on is made of leather produced from the cured 
remains of an elder brain. A grand statue of Gith, an 
obsidian monument over 100 feet tall, stands beside 
the palace.
