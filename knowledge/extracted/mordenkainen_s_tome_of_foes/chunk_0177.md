Amorphous. The oblex can move through a space as narrow as 
l inch wide without squeezing. 
Aversion to Fire. If the oblex takes fire damage, it has disad-
vantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its 
next turn. 
Innate Spellcasting. The oblex's innate spellcasting ability is In· 
telligence (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following 
spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: charm person (as 5th-level spell), detect thoughts, 
hold person 
3/day each: confusion, dimension door, dominate person.fear, 
hallucinatory terrain, hold monster, hypnotic pattern, telekinesis 
Sulfurous Impersonation. As a bonus action, the oblex can 
extrude a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one 
Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. 
This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the 
creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The 
oblex can impersonate 2d6 + l different creatures, each one 
tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 
120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is 
the oblex, meaning the oblex occupies its space and the simu-
lacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to 
damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch 
wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The 
simulacrum disappears ifthe tether is severed.

ACTIONS 
I I 
Multiattack. The elder oblex makes two pseudopod attacks 
and uses Eat Memories. 
Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) psy-
chic damage. 
Eat Memories. The oblex targets one creature it can see within 
5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom 
saving throw or take 44 (8dl 0) psychic damage and become 
memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it 
benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, 
oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. 
While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and sub-
tract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it 
makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the 
first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 
becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which 
point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect 
then ends. 
When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, 
the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains 
all its proficiencies, except any saving throw proficiencies.
