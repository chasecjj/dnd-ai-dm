prayer. Corellon wants them to enjoy life, to try new 
things, to imagine what they desire and then pursue it, 
and to be kind to others. In return for this freedom from 
the usual requirements of religion, Corellon expects 
them to address their own problems and not pray for 
aid in every crisis. These precepts are instilled within 
every elf, since all elves are ultimately descended from 
fragments of Corellon. When elves ask their priests how 
one might become able to sense Corellon's presence, the 
priests often say, "First, truly know yourself. Only then 
can you feel our creator near." 
Services in Corellon's honor are typically conducted 
in natural stone amphitheaters or bowl-shaped forest 
clearings. In keeping with Corellon's chief command-
ment for everyone to be free, all who attend are allowed 
to show their obeisance however they choose, as long 
as their way of contributing combines with the others to 
form a grand display of reverence. Such a gathering has 
the atmosphere of a festival rather than of an organized 
worship service. 
Many elf wizards honor Corellon and adorn their 
spellbooks and towers with the god's symbols. Some of 
them speculate that Corellon is the personification of 
raw magic itself, the primal force that underlies the mul-
tiverse. Corellon is not magic tamed or shaped-not the 
Weave, as some name it- but magic in its original form: 
a well of endless, splendid possibilities. 
The Mysteries of Arvandor. Only those long-lived 
scholars who have researched the elves with the great-
est tenacity have heard of the Mysteries of Arvandor, 
CHAPTER 2 I ELVES 
and all these luminaries have ever been able to glean is 
that it is a secret gathering of elves dedicated to Corellon 
where a magical replaying of the elven myths of creation 
is communally experienced. 
The truth is that the Mysteries of Arvandor is a phe-
nomenon that elves recognize as a summons from their 
creator, which they can choose to accept or disregard. 
The event occurs on one plane or multiple planes within 
the multiverse in a single moment, and there is no guar-
antee that it will ever occur again; the ability to hear 
the call is a rare gift. Depending on Corellon's need, the 
god might call a few dozen or several thousand elves to 
gather, each elf returning to Corellon's body temporarily 
for some task that only the god can comprehend. 
Before this gathering begins, the elves who have been 
selected start to have powerful dreams and waking 
visions, urging them to travel to a certain location. At 
this point, each of the summoned elves must choose 
whether to follow the visions, because it is known that 
not every elf returns from an encounter with Corellon. 
It's true that to be absorbed into the god once more, and 
returned to awareness before the Drawing of the Veil, 
is the fulfillment of every elf's longing, but some elves 
have grown attached to the mortal and mundane world, 
and thus they turn away from their god's summons. 
Those who answer the call of Corellon are telepathically 
guided to their destination, often for hundreds of miles 
across unknown terrain, or even across planes. 
Most elves who return to their homes from the Mys-
teries are forever transformed. These participants 
generally remain silent about their experience, out of 
reverence and appreciation. Those who speak about the 
Mysteries of Arvandor struggle for the right words, but 
they all say in one way or another that experiencing the 
Mysteries is a way for elves to join with Corellon, gifting 
the god with their life force- and in return, they revert 
back to their free, formless nature for a time. After this 
mystical communion, many elves have a deeper under-
THE BLESSED OF CORELLON 
Ever changing, mirthful, and beautiful, the primal elves 
could assume whatever sex they liked. When they bowed 
to Lolth's influence and chose to fix their physical forms, 
elves lost the ability to transform in this way. Yet occasion-
ally elves are born who are so androgynous that they are 
proclaimed to be among the blessed of Corellon-living 
symbols of the god's love and of the primal elves' original 
fluid state of being. Many of Corellon's chief priests bear 
this blessing. 
The rarest of these blessed elves can change their sex 
whenever they finish a long rest-a miracle celebrated by 
elves of all sorts except drow. (The DM decides whether an 
elf can manifest this miracle.) Dark elves find this ability 
to be terrifying and characterize it as a curse, for it could 
destabilize their entire society. lfCorellon's blessing mani-
fests in a drow, that elf usually flees to the surface world to 
seek shelter among those dedicated to Corellon.
