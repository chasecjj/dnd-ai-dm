T H E R EVERED QUEEN 
To SLAY IN HER NAME IS OUR GREATEST SERVlCE. To DIE 
in her name is our last act of reverence. 
-Meldavh, githyanki knight 
Vlaakith sits at the center of everything concerning the 
githyanki. She is their ruler in every sphere of activity 
and, as such, demands and receives utter obedience. 
During the war with the illithids, Vlaakith urged Gith 
to seek out allies from among the planes and in particu-
lar advised her to seek counsel with Tiamat. Gith agreed 
to venture into the Nine Hells to forge an alliance with 
the Queen of Dragons. She didn't return. Instead, the 
great red dragon Ephelomon brought news to the gith: 
Tiamat had pledged many of her red dragon servants 
to the gith cause. They would refrain from attacking 
gith and would provide support against the illithids and 
protection for the gith's outposts on the Material Plane. 
In return, a few select young dragons would serve along-
side the gith for a time, for purposes known only to Tia-
mat. Ephelomon also proclaimed that Vlaakith was to 
rule in Gith's place until she returned. 
After the gith overthrew the mind flayers and Zerthi-
mon's followers began to emerge as a threat to Gith's 
preeminence, Vlaakith played a critical role in ensuring 
that the githyanki under her rule were protected from an 
immediate, direct assault by their kin. Using her mas-
tery of arcane magic, she helped the githyanki establish 
a permanent stronghold on the Astral Plane. From 
there, she began making plans to strike back at both the 
hated mind flayers and the traitorous githzerai. 
THE GRAND PROCLAMATION 
Vlaakith cemented her position as the supreme ruler of 
the githyanki with a grand proclamation that defined the 
githyanki's all-encompassing mission. They had been 
bred and trained for war by their one-time masters and 
had never known anything other than a martial exis-
tence. They needed a clear purpose and a forceful com-
mander to spur them on, and Vlaakith provided both. 
Vlaakith decreed that, having defeated the mind flay-
ers, the githyanki would take the place of the illithids 
as sovereigns of the Material Plane. The many worlds 
of the Material Plane would be the githyanki's gardens, 
prime for harvesting as they saw fit. The Astral Plane 
would be their home domain, because in that timeless 
realm they could ignore the need for food, water, and 
other mundane concerns that plague lesser races. 
Vlaakith also proclaimed that githyanki who proved 
themselves skilled in battle would ascend to an even 
greater paradise. A long lifetime of service would earn 
any githyanki a journey to the boundless delights of her 
innermost court- the wondrous realm that Gith discov-
ered in her journeys, and where she awaits those who 
have proven themselves worthy. 
THE B I TTER TRUTH 
In the time since Vlaakith made this promise to her 
people, she has called many of the most formidable 
githyanki warriors to their reward. At the culmination 
of a grand ceremony that supposedly readies them for 
CHAPTER 4 I C ITH ,\ND THEIR ENDLESS WAR 
their journey to where Gith awaits, the supplicants enter 
her inner sanctum and are never seen again. 
In truth, instead of sending them to paradise, Vlaakith 
drains their souls and absorbs their strength, gaining 
more power with every "ascension." Her knowledge of 
arcane magic equals that of a conclave of archmages, 
while her combat skill matches the combined talents of 
hundreds of sword masters. 
Perhaps the Heh-queen's promise isn't a complete 
fabrication, but no others can say for sure. IfVlaakith 
knows anything more, she has taken drastic measures 
to keep it secret. A few sages and spellcasters have 
sought to learn the truth about Gith's fate using arcane 
magic, only to fall victim to a bizarre curse that trans-
forms them into the formless creatures known as allips. 
All attempts to learn about Gith through divine magic 
return utter silence. Those who try experience a strange 
sensation, as if their minds were teetering on the edge of 
a great abyss, one that spans time, space, and memory. 
BORN TO SERVE 
UNDER THE ILLITHIDS, WE AND THE CITHYANKI FOUGHT 
and died across a thousand worlds for implacable mas-
ters. Under Vlaakith, our kin fight and die across a thou-
sand words for an implacable master. And they call that 
liberation? 
- Adaka Fell Hand, githzerai monk 
From birth, githyanki are conditioned to fight and die for 
their queen. Children endure a brutal upbringing that 
constantly preaches devotion to Vlaakith. Each of the 
fortified settlements where young githyanki are raised 
and trained is a combination of military academy and 
cult headquarters.
