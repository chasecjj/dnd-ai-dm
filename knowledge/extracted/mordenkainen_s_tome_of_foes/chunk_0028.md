These primal elves were much akin to Corellon, not 
nearly as powerful but just as changeable and auda-
cious. Splendid fey creatures, they traveled in Corellon's 
shadow, sparkling like the reflections from a finely cut 
gem. When Corellon came to notice these glorious 
echoes, the god tarried with them in the place that 
became the realm of Arvandor. While enjoying the com-
pany of these primal elves, Corellon came to appreciate 
their ideas, which were both novel and familiar, and 
singled out those of great repute for special treatment. 
Corellon gave each of these luminaries a unique name-
Aerdrie, Keptolo, Solonor, Naralis, Erevan, Hanali, Tar-
sellis, Rillifane, Zandilar, Labelas, and many more- and 
with each name uttered, a new elf god was born. 
One of these beings, although privileged to be elevated 
above the rest of the primal elves, was not satisfied with 
being one of Corellon's trusted underlings. She-for she 
had declared herself thus- saw in the multiverse around 
them other beings making an impact in various worlds. 
The entity who called herself Lolth spoke to the other 
new gods and wove an enticing tale of how the elves 
could attain superiority if only they could relinquish a bit 
of their individual freedom. Together, united in purpose, 
the gods could be the vanguard of this effort. Wasn't 
losing freedom to achieve greatness worth the price? 
Through this argument, Lolth persuaded the primal en-
tities to take static forms, largely resembling what elves 
look like today, and thereby turn away from the example 
of Corellon's wild, ever-shifting ways. 
As these primal reflections of Corellon changed their 
nature and defined themselves, they came to see Corel-
Ion and Lolth in new lights. They now viewed Corellon 
as their father, the one who had sired them, and Lolth 
as their mother, the one who set them on the path to 
their destiny. Each of the other primal elves, as children 
will do, favored one parent or the other. Corellon was 
revolted by this perceived betrayal and railed against 
Lolth's intrusion. Some of the primal elves rose to her 
defense. They argued that no entity who sprang from 
Corellon, no matter how rebellious, should be attacked. 
Those who remained advocates of Corellon insisted that 
their sire also wanted greatness for the elves and that 
such greatness could be achieved if all the primal elves 
followed Corellon's lead. 
The primal elves gathered in great hosts around Lolth 
and Corellon as each entity pleaded its case. At a time 
when Corellon became distracted and lost in thought, 
Lolth crept up on him and sought to strike a mortal 
blow. The elves who favored Corellon helped to blunt 
the attack, but those in Lolth's camp remained aloof and 
detached, doing nothing to prevent her onslaught. 
This act rent the elves asunder. Lolth and Corellon 
parted ways, Lolth to become a demon lord in the Abyss 
and Corellon to become the de facto leader of a pan-
theon that could no longer be trusted. The elf gods who 
sided with Corellon became the Seldarine, and those 
who fled along with Lolth became the Seldarine's dark 
reflection. Save for those who had been named gods, 
Corellon cast out the primal elves from Arvandor and 
consigned them to a physical existence on the Material 
Plane and other worlds of the multi verse such as the 
Feywild and the Shadowfell. From then on, all elves 
CHAPTER 2 I ELVES 
would be mortal, fixed in the forms they had adopted in 
defiance of Corellon's will. The elves who most revered 
Lolth became drow, and the others divided themselves 
into a multitude of surface-dwelling groups, each wor-
shiping some or all of the Seldarine in their respective 
enclaves. 
As a consequence of this rift, no elf would ever fully 
return to Corellon's embrace to enjoy life eternal in 
Arvandor. Instead, when an elven soul returns to Arvan-
dor, it is adopted by the other gods of the S eldarine and 
given respite from the world for a time, during which it 
is left alone to contemplate its creator's disappointment. 
Then the soul emerges from Arvandor, to be reborn into 
a lissome, graceful body that lives for an incredibly long 
time- evidence that their creator holds a love for them 
that, deep down, is boundless. 
THE ELVEN DIASPORA 
The primal elves cavorted on various planes of existence 
before the rift between Corellon and Lolth. Outside the 
glory of Arvandor, their favorite place was the Feywild, 
also called Faerie-a realm of unbridled passion. It is to 
that place of splendors that the elves fled after they were 
flung from Corellon's presence. It is in that place where 
they transformed from fey creatures into humanoids. 
Afterward, they often wept as they realized what they 
had lost, their sorrow made even deeper by the influence 
of the Feywild. But it was also in the Feywild where 
they discovered the potential joys of being a person in a 
world of fixed forms. 
Most of the elves eventually spread from the Feywild 
to other worlds, as wanderlust and curiosity drove 
them to the far reaches of the multiverse. In those other 
worlds, the elves developed the forms of culture and so-
ciety that are now associated with their people. In some 
places, the name Corellon has passed from the memory 
of the elves, but the god's blood flows within them still, 
even if they know nothing of its source. 
No matter where they are in the multiverse, elves of all 
sorts feel a special connection to the realm of Faerie, for 
it was their race's first home after they were cast adrift. 
Even if they can't name that realm or don't know how to 
return there, vestigial memories of the place sometimes 
glimmer in their minds when they trance. 
One group of elves, the eladrin, never left that first 
refuge. After being exposed to the pervasive magic of 
the Feywild for centuries, these elves have a supernat-
ural quality not shared by their cousins on the Material 
Plane. Some eladrin have been transformed so thor-
oughly that they have become fey creatures again and 
have been permitted to return to Arvandor, where they 
are a fascination and a delight to the Seldarine.
