Our three rules come from the actions of Laduguer him-
self, as he quested through the Nine Hells on his mission 
to bring glory to the duergar. 
First, the devils sought to turn his greed against him. 
They offered as much treasure as he could carry, thinking 
that he would take too much and collapse in exhaustion. 
Instead, Laduguer used his cunning magic to twist his 
pockets into bottomless pits, so that there was no limit to 
the treasure he could carry. 
Then, in their frustration at his stratagem, the devils fell 
upon him with claw and blade. They didn't understand 
that with each treasure he claimed, Laduguer's will to win 
grew stronger and stronger. With so much to fight for, he 
lashed out and broke the backs of Hell's legions. 
Finally, Asmodeus confronted Laduguer. The Lord of 
the Nine laughed, joked, and cajoled with all his guile, but 
Laduguer remained grim and stoic, refusing to be affected 
even when the mightiest celestials might have admitted 
some grudging amusement at the devil's antics. Laduguer 
was resolute because he wanted one final treasure: the 
allegiance of Hell in the coming war against the mind 
flayers. Asmodeus offered a world's worth of other temp-
tations, but Laduguer's countenance never changed. Even 
when Asmodeus relented at last, Laduguer accepted the 
arrangement as nothing less than his due and refused to 
display any reaction. 
Thus did Laduguer deliver the three rules that govern 
our people. These principles liberated our people from the 
illithids, and to this day they keep us strong.

CHAPTER 3 I DWARVES AND DUERGAR 
THREE RULES OF CONDUCT 
Duergar psychology, culture, and society are predicated 
on three principles set down by their god Laduguer. 
Adherence to these precepts is now enforced by Ladugu-
er's chief lieutenant, Deep Duerra. 
OUR POCKETS ARE NEVER FULL 
The duergar are fueled in all their actions by two per-
vasive feelings: ambition that never flags and greed that 
can never be satisfied. Though they might scheme and 
plot at great lengths to gain treasure or prestige, success 
is never a cause for celebration. Each acquisition, once 
in hand, is like a meal that quickly loses its appeal, leav-
ing the duergar hungry for more. No matter how much 
wealth or power they gain, it's never enough. 
OUR FIGHT ls NEVER DONE 
As duergar acquire treasure and prestige, they need 
to become ever mightier to hold on to what they have. 
When the duergar wage war on other races, they demon-
strate that the weak aren't fit to possess that which is 
meant for the strong. And to the duergar, no creatures 
are more unworthy of holding wealth than dwarves. 
When duergar have an opportunity to strike at dwarves. 
especially in their strongholds, they fight with utmost vi-
ciousness and cunning, matching the value of the spoils 
to be gained with the intensity of their onslaught. 
OUR RESOLVE ls NEVER SHAKEN 
Any show of weakness is a mortal sin among the du-
ergar, and that stricture extends to personal conduct 
as well as to the workings of a duergar clan. Displays
