might surreptitiously dig for weeks to penetrate a dwarf 
treasure vault, hoping to seize a clan's riches from be-
neath its noses. 
For their part, the dwarves keep safety and defense 
uppermost in their priorities, realizing that there is 
little to be gained from trying to mount a large-scale 
assault against the duergar. They actively protect their 
strongholds, keeping careful watch for signs of tunnel-
ing, and- dwarven pride being what it is- send bands of 
warriors out from time to time to deal reprisals to duer-
gar camps and fortresses. In addition to these rare of-
fensive thrusts, dwarves sometimes send small squads 
of explorers or scouts into the Underdark to learn about 
duergar activity or to recover stolen treasures if they can 
do so without attracting too much attention. 
This eternal enmity between duergar and dwarves 
doesn't consume either side; both have other concerns 
and needs that take much of their time and attention, At 
the same time, the never-ending state of war is never out 
of mind- every dwarf knows that a chance encounter 
with a duergar could be fatal, and every duergar would 
like nothing better than to have such an opportunity. 
D WARVES 
The dwarf god Moradin forged the first dwarves in his 
great workshop, causing them to spring to life from in-
ert metal when he cooled the heated castings with his 
breath. Since then. the dwarves have revered Moradin 
and sought to follow in his footsteps. Through con-
stant, steady work, they strive to emulate the perfect 
example set by the originator of the arts and skills the 
dwarves pursue. 
To the dwarves, Moradin is the Creator. With his im-
peccable skills, he crafted the first dwarves and imbued 
them with a sense of relentless purpose, driven to apply 
their own crafting skills to the raw materials around 
them and thereby unlock the beauty that hides within. 
Moradin is also worshiped as the All-Father, in ac-
knowledgment of his role as the progenitor of the dwar-
ven race. In this aspect as well, he is credited not only 
for the birth of the dwarves but for fostering in them a 
deep appreciation for clan and family. He demonstrates 
how dwarf parents should raise their children, instilling 
in them the urge to further not only themselves but to 
contribute to the success of the larger group.Just as 
Moradin looks out for all dwarves, all dwarves in a clan 
look out for one another. 
THE PATH TO PERFECTION 
EVERY FALL OF THE HAMMER ON THE ANVIL, EVERY FIRE 
stoked in the forge. is a step on a journey set before me by 
Moradin himself. It isn"t work. It is a challenge to achieve 
greatness. 
- Balifra Evcrsharp 
Dwarves have a strong sense of their progress, and each 
day that goes by must bring them closer to the standard 
set by Morad in. Acutely aware of their mortality, they 
see the many centuries afforded to them as too short a 
time to risk wasting even a single day in indolence. 
Moradin crafted the dwarves' sturdy bodies, giving 
them the strength to work for long periods of time. 
Rather than imparting his skills to them, he fueled their 
spirits with a burning desire to follow his example. His 
gifts of durability and purpose gave the dwarves all they 
needed to devote their lives to steady work, refining their 
skills and improving their inner selves while they trans-
form rock and ore into wondrous creations. 
LIFETIMES OF GLORIOUS LABOR 
Dwarf artisans regard the fruits of their labors with 
the same love that members of other races reserve 
for their children. A dwarf's works are built to last for 
centuries, to carry a legacy into the world long after the 
dwarf is gone. Each item a dwarf crafts is a milepost on 
the path to perfection, a step taken toward mastering 
a technique. All of one's works taken together are the 
physical representation of a dwarf's accomplishments. A 
dwarf who has lived a good, fruitful life leaves behind a 
rich legacy of wondrous goods- gleaming metal goblets, 
gem-encrusted stone sculptures, tapestries made of ores 
and minerals, finely honed weapons, or the end result 
of any other endeavor that enriches the crafter while it 
pays homage to the Creator. 
Dwarves guard their personal creations with the 
vigilance and ferocity of a dragon protecting a treasure 
hoard. Such protectiveness isn't often called for in the 
company of friends and family- but just as a parent 
doesn't leave a child unattended, a dwarf doesn't craft 
an item and then knowingly leave it vulnerable to being 
stolen (or worse). A dwarf who loses an item to thievery 
pursues the item's recovery or seeks vengeance against 
the thieves with the same fury that parents direct 
against those who kidnapped their child. 
At the other extreme, a dwarf's gift of a personal item 
to someone else is a deep expression of commitment, 
Jove, and trust. The beneficiary of the gift is expected 
to provide the item with the same careful stewardship 
exhibited by its creator-never letting it fall into an ene-
my's hands and sparing no effort to recover it if is stolen. 
MINDS AS RIGID AS STONE 
Although the dwarves' obsessive pursuit of perfection in 
the arts of crafting leads them to produce great works, 
it comes at a price. Dwarves value stability, repetition, 
and tradition above all else. Chaos and change cause 
distractions from the task at hand. Dwarves crave pre-
dictability, routine, and safety. A mind not fully focused 
can't give a task its proper attention. 
This rigidity in outlook, though a fundamental part of 
the dwarven psyche, can sometimes be a disadvantage. 
Dwarves don't change their minds easily, and once set 
on a course rarely alter their strategy. Their commit-
ment to following a plan serves them well when they 
build a stone bridge designed to last for centuries, but 
the same inflexibility can bring problems when applied 
to the unpredictable dangers of the world. A clan might
