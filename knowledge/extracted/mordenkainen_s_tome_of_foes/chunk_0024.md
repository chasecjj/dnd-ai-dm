DEMONIC BOONS 
Wicked folk who seek power from demons are scattered 
across the multiverse. Some of them gather in cults, but 
many of them act on their own or in small groups. What-
ever their organization, they are united in their desire to 
draw power from the bottomless evil of the Abyss. 
The following entries outline boons that a DM can 
grant to monsters and NPCs dedicated to a particular 
demon lord. The entries also list signature spells associ-
ated with a demon lord. If the monster or NPC can cast 
spells, you can replace any of those spells with spells 
from that list, as long as the new spell is of the same 
level as the spell it replaces. 
A typical demon can impart boons to a number of 
creatures equal to the demon's number of Hit Dice. In 
contrast, demon lords have no limit on the number of 
creatures that can receive their boons. 
Boons from demons are fickle gifts. They remain in 
place only as long as the demon is pleased. Accepting 
such a boon is a damning act that corrupts the soul and 
drives a person toward acts of chaos, evil, and madness. 
Rejecting a boon likely provokes a demon's wrath.
