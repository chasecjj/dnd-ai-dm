a special application. A clan's elders aren't authority 
figures in the traditional sense; they are respected, and 
their words are heeded, because of the stories they tell. 
Their best tales deliver practical knowledge within the 
framework of a mythic saga. An elder doesn't simply an-
nounce, "We must be always ready for a goblin attack." 
Instead, that advice is delivered in a story about how a 
village long ago turned back a goblin invasion, which 
both entertains the villagers and teaches them what to 
do if goblin raiders find the village. 
For the most part, halflings aren't the targets of war-
ring nations. Their villages are of little tactical value, 
nor are they likely to be coveted by evil wizards or to 
become the object of wrath for some dark force. The 
only enemies that a halfl.ing village must watch for on 
an ongoing basis are roving bands of ores or goblins, 
and the occasional hungry ogre or other solitary mon-
ster. And, as halfling luck would have it, these incidents 
are so rare that a single one might be talked about for 
generations. In one village, the story of the ogre that ate 
Farmer Keller's billy goat is a cautionary tale that will 
be repeated and embellished for decades. 
HOMES AWAY FROM HOME 
An individual halfling or a family might leave its com-
munity behind for a number of reasons. A clan that is 
forced to relocate (perhaps because of invading crea-
tures or a natural disaster) might decide to seek refuge 
or opportunity in a city or town, rather than trying to 
find another secluded spot in the wilderness. 
A city or a large town is likely to have a halfling neigh-
borhood already, meaning that newcomers have a place 
to go that they can call home. Often, they join other 
halflings who have set up shop and support whatever en-
terprises their newfound friends have created, making a 
living as storytellers, bakers, chefs, or shopkeepers. 
BAD APPLES 
Although most halflings are energetic and jovial, as with 
any other race individuals among them can be dour or 
curmudgeonly, standoffish or suspicious. Such traits 
might appear in someone who ends up turning fully to 
the cause of evil-an event that is rare in the extreme, 
but has happened often enough that every community 
tells at least one story of this sort. 
A halfling who turns evil usually severs all links to 
their family, friends, and village. Slowly, over time, half-
lings who pursue a dark path-especially those who 
break too many oaths or hurt other halfiings along the

way-lose the protection of Yondalla and the other half-
ling gods. Some say that the minds of these halflings 
eventually become twisted, and they turn into cruel, par-
anoid creatures wracked by misery and despair. 
HALFLING GODS AND MYTHS 
Halflings see their gods more as extended family mem-
bers than as divine beings. They don't worship them in 
the same way as elves and dwarves revere their gods, 
because the halfting gods are viewed as folk heroes-
mortal beings who ascended to divinity, rather than di-
vine entities who descend from their realms to influence 
the world. Because of this outlook, halflings rarely wor-
ship a single deity exclusively; they revere all the gods 
equally and pay their respects in modest ways. 
Halflings speak ofYondalla the way humans would 
describe a strong and protective parent. They talk about 
Brandobaris as others might refer to a mischievous and 
dashing uncle. They don't beseech the gods for daily 
favors, and they have no sense of metaphysical distance 
or separation between them and their gods. To halflings, 
their gods are part of the family. And as family members 
do, the gods set an example that is reaffirmed through 
the stories of their heroic deeds, with each tale helping 
to teach important lessons to the next generation. 
The Hal fling Deities table lists the members of the 
halfling pantheon. For each god, the table notes align-
ment, province (the god's main areas of interest and 
responsibility), suggested domains for clerics who serve 
the god, and a common symbol of the god. Each of the 
gods in the table is described below. 
YON DALLA 
The story ofYondalla begins at the dawn of the world, 
when halfiings were timid wanderers, scraping out a 
meager existence. The goddess Yondalla took note of 
them and decided to adopt the halfl.ings as her people. 
She was a strong leader with a vision for her people, 
and she dedicated her life to gathering them together 
and protecting them. Over time, she elevated to godhood 
those halflings who were the most adept at the skills 
halflings needed to survive. Those legendary halflings 
comprise the rest of the pantheon.
