YuGOLOTHS 
Mercenaries that ply their trade throughout the Lower 
Planes and in other realms, yugoloths have a reputation 
for effectiveness that is matched only by their desire for 
ever more wealth. Although yugoloths aren't especially 
loyal and typically try to exploit every potential loophole 
in a contract, they undertake any task for which they are 
hired, no matter how despicable. Yugoloths come in a 
wide variety of forms, including those described in the 
Monster Manual and the six creatures presented here. 
CANO LOTH 
Canoloths prefer to enter into contracts to guard valu-
able treasures and important locations. They always do 
exactly as asked- never any more, never any less. 
With senses sharp enough to pinpoint the locations 
of nearby invisible creatures, canoloths respond unfail-
ingly to any threat to their charges. Furthermore, they 
emit a magical distortion field that prevents creatures 
close to them from teleporting. 
Canoloths confront intruders with swift and terrible 
force, projecting long, spiny tongues to grab their foes 
and drag them close. What happens next depends on 
the contract. Unless instructed to kill, a canoloth merely 
holds onto its prisoner, but if given the order to do so, it 
tears its prey limb from limb.

Cll APTER 6 I BESTIARY 
Dhergoloths rush into battle like whirlwinds of destruc-
tion, lashing out with five sets of claws, which extend 
from their squat, barrel-shaped bodies. They take 
contracts to put down uprisings, clear out rabble, and 
eliminate scouts and skirmishers, and they revel in the 
butchery they create, their unhinged laughter rising 
above their victims' screams. 
Since dhergoloths are little more than dumb brutes, 
employers must use caution when instructing these 
fiends. They can handle simple orders that don't take 
a lot of time to resolve. When given anything complex 
to do, they either forget what they're told or don't listen 
in the first place, and then bungle the task that was 
set for them.
