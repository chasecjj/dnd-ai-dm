raids. All githyanki are required to report to one of these 
districts regularly for weapon practice. Non-githyanki 
that venture into these areas are attacked on sight un-
less accompanied by a knight who can vouch for them. 
Mlar District. This area passes for an artisan's dis-
trict. Githyanki engaged in distractions that involve 
artistry or creation gather here, both to share their skills 
and to show off their goods. Outsiders can pass through 
the district if appropriately disguised; the githyanki 
bring captured artisans here to provide insight and tu-
telage, but rarely keep a close watch on them. After all, 
they have little chance of escaping the city. 
Shipyards. The githyanki store and maintain their 
vessels at docks and outcrops that adjoin the military 
districts. Those who are assigned to ship maintenance 
enjoy a high status and are allowed to consider their 
work as part of their military service. Githyanki war-
riors provide labor as needed. 
Dragon Caves. The shattered lower body of the dead 
god contains an abundance of natural caves and fis-
sures. Each of the red dragons that serve the githyanki 
has a lair deep within this region, jealously guarding its 
hoard until it is called for service. No one has ever suc-
cessfully mapped out the strange passages and tunnels, 
and a variety of scavengers, astral predators, and other 
creatures lair here, some of them likely dating from the 
time before the githyanki came along. The residents of 
Tu'narath don't typically spend time in the caves, except 
as necessary to tend to the dragons. On occasion, a 
githyanki craving a new experience might venture into 
this area for a respite from boredom. Those who don't 
return, it can be assumed, found what they were after. 
CHAPTER 4 I GITH AND THEIR l::NDLESS WAR 
Rumors persist of an enormous dungeon that lies be-
yond the caves, a hidden fortress occupied by a mighty 
demigod who claimed The One in the Void as its home 
before the githyanki occupied it. Coteries of Red Wiz-
ards from the land of Thay on Faeriin, accompanied by 
githyanki knights, have ventured into this area in recent 
years. Supposedly, the Thayans once emerged with a 
huge adamantine container that rumbled and shook, as 
if to the beat of a monstrous heart. 
SURVIVOR COMMUNITIES 
As befits a society of conquerors, the githyanki have no 
regard for the victims of their raids. They take lives to 
assert their dominance, not out of anger or because they 
feel threatened. From time to time, instead of killing every· 
one they encounter on a raid, they bring captives back to 
Tu'narath for various reasons. 
The githyanki treat prisoners with the same detachment 
and disdain they show for those they slay. When captives 
are no longer useful, their masters might end their lives, or 
they might simply stop caring about their possessions and 
leave the creatures to fend for themselves. 
The hardiest and most elusive of these folk make their 
way to the District of Discards, where they can take refuge 
from the threats that face them in other parts of the city 
and live in relative obscurity. The githyanki care nothing 
for what goes on in these survivor communities, unless a 
disruption becomes serious enough to attract their atten-
tion. A group of would-be infiltrators might be able to get a 
foothold in Tu'narath by stealthily entering the district and 
blending in with a community of survivors.
