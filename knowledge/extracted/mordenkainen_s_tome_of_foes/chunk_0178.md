OGRES 
Ogres are infamously dim-witted, but with enough time 
and patience, some of them can be trained to carry 
out specialized missions in battle. The names they are 
given- the battering ram, the bolt launcher, the chain 
brute, and the howdah- reflect their particular func-
tions. These jobs are simple, but they're tailored to take 
advantage of an ogre's strengths. 
OGRE BATTERING RAM 
An ogre battering ram carries an enormous club used 
primarily for bashing doors into kindling, but which also 
works well for smashing foes. These ogres are drilled 
in two simple tasks: rushing forward to shatter enemy 
fortifications, and using their weapons to force an ad-
vancing enemy to halt. 
OGRE BOLT LAUNCHER 
A bolt launcher carries a gigantic crossbow-a weapon 
so large it's essentially an ogre-held ballista. An ogre 
bolt launcher can load this immense weapon and loose 
its deadly missile as quickly as a dwarf handles a cross-
bow. The bolts are so large that few ogres can carry 
more than a half-dozen at a time, but bolt launchers 
have been known to uproot small trees or tear beams 
out of buildings and launch those when their ammuni-
tion runs low .
