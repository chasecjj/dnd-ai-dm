works. It also might be evidence of a lesson that she 
learned all too well from the way Corellon reacted to her 
betrayal of him: the smallest flame of resistance must be 
snuffed out before it grows into a conflagration. 
SOCIETY OF BLOOD AND POISON 
The principal organization in drow culture and society 
is the house, an extended clan that comprises many 
related families, plus a number of lesser families who 
have pledged loyalty to the house. A house's member-
ship also includes some (potentially very large) number 
of indentured drow servants and slaves of other species. 
A house usually specializes in a business, a service, or a 
craft that supports by providing income. 
Houses are in constant competition with one another. 
They vie for money, for prestige, and, more than any-
thing else, for power over others- the surest sign of 
Lolth's approval. 
No tactic is outside the rules in this ongoing conflict. 
Raids against another house's outlying property (farm-
ing caverns, trade caravans, or hunting parties) are com-
monplace. Rumors about disloyalty, conspiracies with 
surface elves, or heresy against Lolth are circulated so 
frequently that no one knows what to be sure of. Assas-
sinations, both by blade and by the use of special drow 
poisons, are a constant threat. Bodyguards and food 
tasters are as necessary to the survival of a high-rank-
ing drow as air and water. Squabbles within a house 
also occur from time to time as relatives jockey for po-
sition. It's a rare occurrence, though far from unknown, 
for drow to assassinate their own parents or siblings if 
that's what it takes to create a path for advancement. 
CITIES WITHOUT SUNLIGHT 
The drow might have not chosen to live in the Under-
dark, but just the same they consider it their home, not 
a prison.Just as the sea elves adapted to their aquatic 
realm, the drow have long been accustomed to the harsh 
conditions of life in the Underdark. They've lived away 
from sunlight for so long that they can't bear the touch 
of it on their flesh, and thus they prefer to visit the sur-
face only at night. 
Even though they Live underground, drow are much 
more than cave-dwellers. Their cities are as magnificent 
as anything built by surface elves, and their defenses 
are even more secure. Their most important sites are 
located inside immense, hollowed-out stalactites and 
stalagmites, with entrances well guarded. 
D RI DERS: LOW EST OF TH E Low 
Much confusion and misinformation exists about driders 
among non-drow, but all dark elves know exactly what drid-
ers are: failures. They have either fared badly in Lolth's test 
or displeased her in some other way. 
Once its transformation has taken hold, a newly created 
drider is shunned by its house and exiled from the com· 
munity, with nothing but a few meager supplies and its 
knowledge of the Underdark to protect it. Drow congregate 
to throw stones at the still-dazed creature and drive it into 
the tunnels beyond the city's environs. If it's unlucky, it's 
attacked by a roper, a carrion crawler, or another drider. If 
it's lucky, the new drider finds a safe place to hide while its 
wounds heal. 
So begins a drider's life in exile. Another widespread 
misunderstanding about driders is that they serve the 
drow as pickets, elite troops, or even suicide squads. They 
do none of those things. They are despised outcasts who 
live on the fringes of drow territory. Even though drow 
revile driders, they don't kill them, because a drider's pun· 
ishment is to live a long life in wretchedness. Killing one 
would cut short Lolth's judgment and possibly earn the 
same sentence for the perpetrator. 
Driders that survive for a long time can become accom-
plished hunters and navigators in the Underdark. Nothing 
will reopen the doors of drow society to them, but some· 
times a drider can find a place in another community. 
Someone who needs a guide through the Underdark might 
not find a better one than a centuries-old drider that has 
faced every hazard those tunnels hold. 
RULE OF MATRIARCHS 
Females are the top figures in drow society. At the head 
of each house is someone who is a shrewd business op-
erator, a skilled tactician, a high priestess of Lolth, and 
probably also a merciless assassin with blood on her 
hands. Unlike with many other races, female drow are 
typically taller and more robust than males. 
To rise to the top echelons of power, a female must 
first become a priestess of Lolth. Then, to ascend to 
the status of high priestess, she must take advantage 
of powerful connections or craft special alliances. The 
path to ultimate power in drow society is never direct 
and is always paved with death. 
A male drow can advance in standing as a combatant, 
a consort, or both. Physical beauty and fitness are highly 
prized in male drow, and those who are especially fa. 
vored in this regard can earn protection and gifts from 
their matrons. A few males can attain high status in 
their society, especially those who serve as mages, but 
they never overshadow the females of their houses. Even 
the most intelligent, strong-willed, and devious male will 
never be more than a second-class citizen in any drow 
city or house. That situation will never change as long as 
Lolth reigns as their queen. 
NOCTURNAL RAIDERS 
-------
If the drow kept to themselves in their subterranean 
cities and fortresses, few other creatures would care. 
The dark elves could indulge their evil practices until 
their caverns were heaped with corpses and awash in 
blood. Even the surface elves might be content to over-
look their hatred for their kin and leave the drow alone,
