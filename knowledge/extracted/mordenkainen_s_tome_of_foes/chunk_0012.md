Second, Asmodeus decreed that any deal Baalzebul 
strikes shall end in disaster for the other party. For th'is 
reason, other devils avoid forming alliances with him, 
even though they know he is compelled not to lie to 
them. Mortals, on the other hand, know nothing of the 
situation and still offer their souls to him. 
His ability to scheme neutralized by these limitations, 
Baalzebul continues to ensure that the devils' bureau-
cracy runs smoothly. He focuses most of his attention on 
gathering souls from the Material Plane, a task to which 
his talent for lying is well suited. 
A MAZE OF INFORMATION 
Every edict, policy statement, scientific treatise, and 
other document in the Nine Hells is recorded, copied, 
and filed away in Maladomini's archives. These store-
houses are buried deep underground, so that they 
would remain intact if the layer is ever again hit by the 
sort of devastation that occurred when Baalzebul was 
brought to heel. 
Each document in the archives is important in its own 
way, and all these sites are heavily guarded by devils 
and traps. Even if would-be thieves could get around the 
defenses, they would have figure out how to navigate the 
complex classification system that marks the precise 
location of each bit of paperwork stored within. 
THE PRICE OF REDEMPTION 
Baalzebul and his agents recruit mortals that are 
desperate for redemption of some sort, perhaps the 
restoration of lost status or the recovery of resources 
that were lost because of treachery or incompetence. 
To these people who have been humbled by unfortunate 
events, Baalzebul offers a supernatural means of re-
gaining one's reputation or riches. The failed merchant 
desperate for another chance at making his fortune or 
the once-traitorous knight eager to restore her honor are 
examples of the individuals he deals with. 
What those folk don't know is that Baalzebul is a mas-
ter manipulator. He directs his agents to embed clauses 
and specifications in contracts that trip up the unwary. 
Because Baalzebul's targets are typically desperate, he 
almost always bargains from a position of strength. 
Although Baalzebul claims a great number of unsus-
pecting souls, almost all of them are pathetic, incom-
petent wretches best suited for the dreg legions, whose 
only task is to die as slowly as possible so that they 
might delay the advance of an abyssal army. 
MEPHISTOPHELES 
THERE ARE FEW PROBLEMS THAT CANNOT BE SOLVED 
through the application of overwhelming arcane firepower. 
- Mephistopheles 
Cania, like Stygia above it, is a bitterly cold realm of 
glaciers and howling ice storms. Mephistopheles holds 
court here with the ice devils that make up his retinue. 
Operating from his great tower, the icy citadel of Me-
phistar, he conducts a never-ending series of experi-
ments that expand his understanding of arcane magic 
and of the planes of existence. 
CHAPTER l I THE BLOOD WAR 
Mephistopheles keeps his realm churning with pun-
ishing storms. He doesn't entertain visitors, and Asmo-
deus has charged him with maintaining a stout security 
force around Nessus. Travelers that aren't protected 
against the environment, which is cold enough to kill a 
creature in seconds, have little hope of surviving. 
The foremost wizard in the Hells, Mephistopheles 
suffers nothing that would compromise his intellectual 
focus. He hates distractions and allows only particular 
devils to speak to him without first being spoken to. He 
has been known to disintegrate minions for the smallest 
transgressions, and sometimes carries out an execution 
simply because he suspected that a devil was about to 
do something to annoy him. 
Mephistopheles is able to devote almost all his time to 
his research thanks to the loyalty of Hutijin, his top lieu-
tenant. Even though Hutijin commands enough power to 
threaten his master's position, he is content to remain at 
the right hand of the throne, at least for the time being. 
EXPERIMENTS IN THE UNKNOWN 
Cania is essentially an enormous laboratory. Mephis-
topheles and his devotees prefer to conduct their studies 
in a wasteland where they can unleash gouts of arcane 
energy without destroying anything important. Experi-
ments involving new spells, new magic items, and other 
innovations for the infernal arsenal regularly cause lo-
calized cataclysms in this place. 
This activity attracts numerous spies despite the 
inhospitable environment. Merely observing Mephis-
topheles's disciples at work can provide insights into 
the nature of their research and the discoveries they 
have made. His court is constantly alert for agents from 
Dis, since it greatly pains Dispater that Mephistophe-
les might come across a scrap of information that he 
doesn't possess. A number of renowned archmages, 
including Mordenkainen, have at times found their way 
into this realm on a search for forgotten lore or in the 
hope of confirming a theory of arcane magic. 
KEEPER OF ARCANE SOULS 
Mephistopheles and his followers specialize in luring 
wizards and sages into making compacts with the Nine 
Hells. Of all the Lords of the Nine, he has the lowest 
quotas but the highest standards. He harvests the souls 
of skilled wizards and cunning sages, exactly the sort of 
folk he needs to further his research. Curiosity and am-
bition are motivating factors that entice such souls into 
his service- often, a mage who gets an opportunity to
