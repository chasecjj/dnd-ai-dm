concerned but not alarmed. They attribute these acts 
of rambunctiousness to Brandobaris's meddling, and 
almost all children outgrow this tendency to put them-
selves at risk. But if one persists in these antics, the 
other villagers say the youngster has "fancy feet." 
The term refers to the persistent urge to wander be-
yond the boundaries of the community- activity that 
is in the purview of Brandobaris, who is said to have 
"the fanciest feet of all." Each village has its own way of 
coping with this phenomenon. Some elders- especially 
those who once had fancy feet themselves- just shrug, 
smile, and say it is the way of things. Nevertheless, 
well-meaning villagers might try to dissuade a youngster 
from leaving the community. Other villages are much 
more supportive of one of their members who demon-
strates the urge to adventure, likely because some of 
their elders have gone into the world and returned to tell 
about it. In one of these places, a youngster about to set 
out is celebrated with a rousing party that goes far into 
the night, during which the adventurer-to-be is regaled 
by tales of other "fancy-footed" heroes of halfling history. 
HALFLINCS OF THE MULTIVERSE 
In the worlds of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, many kinds of half-
lings exist, and they vary greatly from place to place. 
In the Forgotten Realms, halflings are of the lightfoot 
and strongheart varieties. Lightfoot halflings are taller and 
thinner than stronghearts, although "thinner" is a relative 
word by halfling standards. Lightfoots prefer to live on 
the move in traveling bands, and their members are most 
likely to take to a life of adventuring. Stronghearts are 
homebodies by nature, most of them likely to spend their 
lives tucked away in their secluded villages, and are also 
quite happy living in the communities of other races, work-
ing as farmers, innkeepers, cobblers and bakers. 
In the Dragonlance setting, kender are the counterparts 
ofhalflings. Possessed of shorter life spans than their 
counterparts on other worlds, the kender have pointed 
ears and become wizened as they age. Great mimics and 
vocalists, kender are consummate storytellers, but they of-
ten speak too fast for other races not accustomed to their 
frenetic cadence. 
Halflings in the world of Greyhawk live in underground 
burrows or small cottages in the grasslands or hills. They 
are lightly covered with hair over most of their bodies, 
especially on the backs of their hands and the tops of their 
feet, and they rarely wear shoes. The three subraces are 
the hairfeet, which are the most numerous; the tallfellows, 
which are the tallest and least athletic of the halflings, 
somewhat resembling elves; and the stouts, which are 
more akin to dwarves in temperament and stature than 
the other two. 
On the world of Athas in the Dark Sun setting, halflings 
are feral creatures, prone to devouring the flesh of humans 
and elves. Small, furtive and sun-bronzed, they live a hard 
life under their chief, eking out a savage existence by hunt-
ing, foraging, and raiding. Outside their tribe, halflings are 
mistrusting, cynical, and often paranoid, since they think 
that all other races are as fond of devouring humanoids 
as they are. 
LEGENDS IN THE MAKING 
Halflings who take up a life of adventure are embold-
ened by the stories told by their elders- tales of halfling 
heroes slinking through human cities, plundering dun-
geons laden with treasure, and being received in the hall 
of a dwarven king. Each new would-be hero hopes to 
have adventures that merit exciting stories of their own, 
to inspire and delight new generations for years to come. 
Of course, not every journey into the world involves 
risking one's life or claiming great riches. An adven-
ture for a halfling could mean traveling with a caravan, 
sneaking on board a tall ship, serving as a messenger 
for a lord, or living with the dwarves for a few years 
as an apprentice. From the point of view of a ha I fling 
villager, going anywhere beyond home is an adventure, 
and anyone who does so must have a fine story or two 
to tell upon their return. Even on a dangerous mission, 
halflings find enjoyment all around them. If it's raining, 
a halfling is playing in the puddles; in a stiff wind, a ha If-
ling might fly a kite instead of seeking shelter. 
HALFLING TABLES

ers and DMs who want to choose or randomly generate
