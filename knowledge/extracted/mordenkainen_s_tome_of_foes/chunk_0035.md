Few among the elves, and an even smaller number 
of half-elves, have the honor of being inducted into the 
ranks of the bladesingers. One must have the mind nec-
essary to be a great wizard, and also the agility of the 
greatest dancers. 
THE SELDARIN E 
The pantheon of elven deities, called the Seldarine, 
includes Corellon and the group of primal elves whom 
he graced with divinity. These gods were the ones who 
brought word to Corellon of Lolth's radical ideas, and 
their creator rewarded them with a vast increase in their 
divine power. When Lolth lured some of the primal elves 
away from Corellon with her promises, this high-rank-
ing core of divine entities remained loyal. Because they 
rejected Lolth's treacherous ways, they retained their 
primal power and their immortality. 
Surface elves, and other elves who dwell in the light, 
revere these entities for remaining true to Corellon. In

practice, this reverence is expressed more as the honor-
ing of an ancestor than the worshiping of a god, for all 
the elves are descended from the Seldarine. 
The Elf Deities table enumerates the members of the 
Seldarine. For each god, the table notes alignment, prov-
ince (the god's main areas of interest and responsibility), 
suggested domains for clerics who serve the god, and a 
common symbol of the god. Several of the gods in the 
table are described in this section. 
CORELLON LARETHIAN 
The creator of all elves is both chaos and beauty per-
sonified. Corellon is as fluid and changeable as a breeze 
or a brook- quick to anger, but equally quick to forgive 
and forget. The god loves magic, artistry, nature, and 
freedom. Anyone who has felt the mystical presence of 
Corellon describes it as a joy like no other, followed by a 
deep melancholy when his presence is no longer felt. 
Corellon doesn't expect much from followers-no 
complex rituals or frequent ceremonies or even regular
