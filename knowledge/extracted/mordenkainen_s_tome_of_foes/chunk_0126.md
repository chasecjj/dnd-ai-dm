• Fraz-Urb'luu creates a wave of anguish. Each crea-
ture he can see within the lair must succeed on a 
DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 33 (6d10) psy-
chic damage. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing Fraz-Urb'luu's lair is warped by 
his magic, creating one or more of the following effects: 
Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the lair fre-
quently see hallucinations of long-dead friends and 
comrades that vanish after only a brief glimpse. 
Roads and paths within 6 miles of the lair twist and 
turn back on themselves, making navigation in the 
area exceedingly difficult. 
If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile 
of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 
Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness 
determined by the Madness of Fraz-Urb'luu table. A 
creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be 
affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours. 
If Fraz-Urb'luu dies, these effects fade over the course of 
ldlO days. 
MADNESS OF FRAZ- URB'LUU 
If a creature goes mad in Fraz-Urb'luu's lair or within 
line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of 
Fraz-Urb'luu table to determine the nature of the 
madness, which is a character flaw that lasts 
until cured. See the Dungeon Master's 
Guide for more on madness.

eficial to me."

"I have intermittent hallucinations and fits of cata-

"My mind wanders as I have elaborate fantasies 
that have no bearing on reality. When I return my

"I convince myself that things are true, even in the 
face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary."

"My perception of reality doesn't match anyone 
else's. It makes me prone to violent delusions that 
make no sense to anyone else."

GRAZ
1ZT 
The appearance of the Dark Prince is a warning that 
not all beautiful things are good. Standing nearly nine 
feet tall, Graz'zt strikes the perfect figure of untamed de-
sire, every plane and curve of his body, every glance of 
his burning eyes, promising a mixture of pleasure and 
pain. A subtle wrongness pervades his beauty, from the 
cruel cast of his features to the six fingers on each hand 
and six toes on each foot. Graz'zt can also transform 
himself at will, appearing in any humanoid form that 
pleases him, or his onlookers, all equally tempting in 
their own ways. 
Graz'zt surrounds himself with the finest of things 
and the most attractive of servants, and he adorns him-
self in silks and leathers both striking and disturbing 
in their workmanship. His lair, and those of his cultists, 
are pleasure palaces where nothing is forbidden, save 
moderation or kindness. 
The dark Prince of Pleasure considers restriction the 
only sin, and takes what he wants. Cults devoted to him 
are secret societies of indulgence, often using their de-
bauchery to subjugate others through blackmail, addic-
tion, and manipulation. They frequently wear alabaster 
masks with ecstatic expressions and ostentatious dress 
and body ornamentation to their secret assignations. 
Although he prefers charm and subtle manipulation, 
Graz'zt is capable of terrible violence when provoked. 
He wields the greatsword Angdrelve, also called Wave 
of Sorrow, its wavy, razor-edged blade dripping acid at 
his command. 
GRAz'zT's L AIR 
Graz'zt's principal lair is his Argent Palace, a grandiose 
structure in the city of Zelatar, found within his abyssal 
domain of Azzatar. Graz'zt's maddening influence radi-
ates outward in a tangible ripple, warping reality around 
him. Given enough time in a single location, Graz'zt 
can twist it with his madness. Graz'zt's lair is a den of 
ostentation and hedonism. It is adorned with finery and 
decorations so decadent that even the wealthiest of mor-
tals would blush at the excess. Within Graz'zt's lairs, 
followers, thralls, and subjects alike are forced to slake 
Graz'zt's thirst for pageantry and pleasure.

CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Graz'zt can 
take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he 
can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
• Graz'zt casts the command spell on every creature of 
his choice in the lair. He needn't see each one, but he 
must be aware that an individual is in the lair to target 
that creature. He issues the same command to all 
the targets. 
• Smooth surfaces within the lair become as reflective 
as a polished mirror. Until a different lair action is 
used, creatures within the lair have disadvantage on 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
