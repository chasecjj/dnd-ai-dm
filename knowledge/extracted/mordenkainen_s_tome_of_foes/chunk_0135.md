BLUE ABISHAI 
Seekers of forgotten lore and lost relics, blue abishais 
are the most cunning and learned of their kind. Their 
research into occult subjects gleaned from tomes and 
grimoires plundered from across the multiverse enables 
them to become accomplished spellcasters. They use 
their magic to devastate their mistress's enemies. 
GREEN ABISHAI 
The envoys ofTiamat's armies, green abishais represent 
the god's interests in the Nine Hells and beyond. Their 
keen senses make them adept at discovering secrets 
and other sensitive information, while their diplomatic 
skills and their magic ensure that they can manipulate 
even the shrewdest opponents. 
RED ABISHAI 
Red abishais have no equals among the abishais when 
it comes to leadership ability and raw power. They can 
invoke Tiamat's authority to bend even dragons to their 
will. Red abishais lead other devils into battle or take 
charge of troublesome cults to ensure that they continue 
to carry out Tiamat's commands. A red abishai cuts a 
fearsome figure, and that sight can be inspiring to the 
abishai's allies, filling them with a fanatical willing-
ness to fight. 
WHITE ABISHAI 
Though they are the least of their kind, white abishais 
fight with a reckless fury, making them ideally suited for 
bolstering the ranks ofTiamat's armies. White abishais 
fight without fear, becoming whirlwinds of destruction 
on the battlefield.
