The dark elves believe that Selvetarm walked in soli-
tude for many centuries, spurning both Lolth and Corel-
lon, for he was not wholly given over to evil but neither 
was he fully aligned with the forces of light. Eventually 
his path crossed that of Eilistraee, and he began to ap-
preciate the goodness of the Dark Maiden, as exhibited 
in her teachings and deeds. By aiding in Selvetarm's 
redemption, Eilistraee hoped to begin to heal the 
breach between drow and the Setdarine. That hope was 
dashed, however, by the insidious plotting ofLolth. 
The Queen of Spiders had long resented the existence 
of Zanassu, a minor demon lord that competed with 
her for divine authority over spiders. She hated almost 
as much the possibility of Eilistraee's winning an ally 
among the drow pantheon. A prime opportunity arose 
when the spider demon lost much of its power in a con-
flict on the Material Plane. Lolth convinced Selvetarm 
to destroy Zanassu in its depleted state and seize the 
spider demon's burgeoning divine power. She did so by 
suggesting to Selvetarm that a victory would win him 
favor in the eyes of Eilistraee, whom he greatly admired. 
But when Selvetarm prevailed in battle over the spider 
demon, the wholly evil and chaotic nature of the divine 
power he absorbed overwhelmed Selvetarm's innate 
goodness and weakened him enough that the Spider 
Queen could bound his will tightly to her own. 
Enraged by Lolth's duplicity, Selvetarm is an engine 
of destruction, an eight-limbed maestro of slaughter. If 
allowed to operate unchecked, he could rend his way 
through an entire cl row city in a berserk rage. Keeping 
him restrained is one of the few acts of Lolth that can be 
described as merciful. 
Because of his status as a captive, Selvetarm draws 
little attention from drow of high status. Low-caste 
drow warriors who are themselves slaves or indentured 
servants, or who have no chance to rise in rank, can be-
seech Selvctarm for prowess in battle without suffering 
any shame. Anyone of high standing or who hopes to 
attain high standing shies away from openly expressing 
reverence for Selvetarm, though such an individual 
might still beg his aid privately. 
VHAERAUN 
Vhaeraun stands for the dark elves' superiority over 
other races and for the primacy of individual drow over 
other drow. He is a god of arrogance, and thus he con-
dones all acts of avarice, fair and foul alike. Those who 
take what they want from whom they wish, whether 
through stealth or bullying, pay homage to Vhaeraun. 
He is patron to thieves and often the object of prayer be-
fore drow embark on a raid. 
Among the male gods of the Dark Seldarine, he is as 
widely recognized and accepted as Keptolo. But Vhaer-
aun represents a different aspect of drow masculinity: 
strong, silent, obedient, swift, and deadly. He is thought 
of as Lolth's favored son, in contrast to Keptolo's role as 
her beautiful consort. 
Due to his high status in the Dark Seldarine (for a 
male} and because of his arrogance, a few of his wor-
shipers look on him as an advocate of equality between 
male and female drow. That heresy, when it is expressed 
openly. is liable to be savagely crushed by the priest-
esses of Loi th. So most of Vhaeraun's male followers 
honor him simply by trying to carve out better lives for 
themselves, and that activity is tolerated. Even so, adher-
ents of Vhaeraun don't appear in public without wearing 
masks. This practice exists in part because Vhaeraun is
