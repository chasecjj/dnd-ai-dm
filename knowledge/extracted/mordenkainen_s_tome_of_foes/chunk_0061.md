by dwarf artisans, slabs of stone that fit so precisely in 
their openings that no one but a dwarf knows how to 
locate and open one. 
Unlike some other races that guard their territory by 
creating features that actively deter invaders, dwarves 
rarely use arrow traps, pit traps, and other such mea-
sures that could cause harm to clan members. They see 
little sense in risking injury if a trap of that sort mal-
functioned or was accidentally triggered by a dwarf. A 
defensive measure isn't doing its job if it ends up hurting 
those it was meant to protect. 
D WARVES OF THE MULTIVERSE 
Like any race, dwarves display a wide array of skin 
tones, hair colors, and other physical traits. Adding to 
this diversity, they have a variety of cultural identities 
from world to world across the multiverse. 
DWARVES OF GREYHAWK 
The hill dwarves and mountain dwarves of war-wracked 
Ocrth have endured many centuries of turbulence. Their 
outlook on the world is shaped largely by how they per-
ceive outsiders and how much of a threat those outsid-
ers might pose. 
Hill Dwarves. Most of the dwarves on Oerth are hill 
dwarves. Compared to the mountain dwarves, they have 
a relaxed and open attitude toward the outside world. 
Because they dwell in regions that lack the towering 
peaks that their mountain kin favor, they build stone 
fortresses that start above ground and end in chambers 
that tunnel deep beneath the surface. A typical clan's 
settlement features stout walls and a sturdy gate, in-
side which are living quarters, community areas, and a 
well-protected treasure vault. 
Hill dwarves are more perceptive and empathic than 
their kin. They rely on their intuition and insight to 
guide them in relationships with other races. To offset 
the disadvantage of not being protected by mountains, 
they frequently form defensive pacts with humans, 
gnomes, and elves that live nearby. 
Although the best artisans are revered for their skills, 
just as in any dwarf clan, hill dwarves put special em-
phasis on diplomacy and trade as key elements in the 
clan's survival. They appreciate the value of creating 
high-quality goods to trade with others, both to enrich 
the clan and to form bonds with neighbors. 
Mountain Dwarves. As tough and strong as the nat-
ural stoneworks they dwell among, mountain dwarves 
see themselves as the true progenitors of their race and 
the exemplars of their gods' traditions and teachings. 
Mountain dwarves maintain a strong martial tradi-
tion. They know that the great wealth they accumulate 
in their vaults makes them prime targets for raiders. As 
a result, all the adults in a typical mountain dwarf clan 
are trained in the use of armor and weapons. 
Miners are among the most revered members of a 
clan, since the tunnels and shafts they dig in search of 
ore are considered works of art in themselves-as much 
a part of a clan's legacy as any treasure chamber heaped 
with gold and gems. 
The mountain dwarves' militancy and the need to 
protect their mines leads them into frequent clashes 
with Underdark monsters. Creatures or raiding parties 
that enter the mines from below invite retributive raids 
by dwarf war parties. The dwarves will mount an am-
bitious assault to reclaim even a single miner captured 
by attackers. Even the cruel drow are reluctant to raid 
mountain dwarf settlements, since they know a single 
attack will ignite the flames of war. 
Hill dwarves view their mountain cousins as overly 
grim shut-ins who refuse to believe that life is anything 
but a constant battle for survival. Mountain dwarves 
view their hill-dwelling relatives as painfully naive op-
timists who risk losing their precious works because of 
their overexposure to the outside world. 
DWARVES OF THE FORGOTTEN REALMS 
In an age long s ince passed into myth, the dwarves of 
Toril were one people dwelling in the mountains where 
three contincnts- FaerOn, Kara-Tur, and Zakhara- met. 
A gradual diaspora over millennia spread them across 
the world, giving rise to diverse types of dwarves. In 
FaerOn, the two most numerous subraces are gold 
dwarves and shield dwarves. 
The dwarves of FaerOn traveled north from the 
southern mountains and founded an extensive subter-
ranean empire called Bhaerynden, which lay beneath 
a hot savannah now known as the Shaar. A rift in the 
leadership of the dwarves caused a schism among 
their people. One group left Bhaerynden and built new 
kingdoms in the North and the Heartlands, becoming 
the shield dwarves. Those who remained became the 
gold dwarves. 
Gold dwarf scholars point to Abbathor as the cause of 
this division, claiming that the deity's influence weak-
ened Bhaerynden and left it vulnerable to the dark elves 
that threatened its borders. That claim might well be 
true, but shield dwarf scholars point out that those who 
abandoned Bhaerynden did so two millennia before 
the drow conquered the place. They put the blame for 
its fall on the complacency that drove their ancestors to 
leave. "Gold dwarves endure. Shield dwarves adapt." 
That is a truism that both subraces of dwarves repeat 
with pride and derision, each extolling the qualities of 
their own kind. 
Gold Dwarves. The conquest of Bhaerynden by the 
drow spurred its survivors to create many separate out-
posts in southern lands. During the same period, the 
dark elves fell victim to infighting, which culminated in 
the collapse of the great cavern. Emboldened by this de-
velopment, armies of gold dwarves returned to drive the 
drow from the region. At the site that would come to be 
known as the Great Rift, they shaped the underground 
canyons and passages to their needs, and from there 
they tunneled under the Shaar for miles around, carving 
a new empire from stone. 
Gold dwarves consider themselves the true keepers of 
dwarf culture. More so than shield dwarves, they prefer 
to dwell underground. Many gold dwarves live their lives 
without seeing the sun. Surrounded by the artistry and 
wealth that earlier generations have drawn from the 
earth, they are accustomed to Haunting their fortune, 
dressing in bejeweled and glittering garments. Gold 
dwarves who interact with other races (including shield
