PRINCES OF THE ABYSS 
The Abyss is a vast wound in the cosmic order, a bot-
tomless pit teeming with creatures that exist only to 
rend, tear, and destroy. The demon princes, individual 
demons of great power and determination, bend and 
shape the Abyss and its inhabitants to meet their every 
whim. These mighty beings imagine themselves at the 
center of the cosmos. Each demon prince believes that 
the universe will one day be theirs to command, its laws 
and structure twisted and warped to match the demons' 
ideal of perfection. 
The demon princes' arrogance is exceeded only by 
their ambition. While any rational being would dismiss 
their goals as empty ambitions sparked by madness, the 
truth remains that the demon princes and their thralls 
are among the mightiest forces in the planes. It is con-
ceivable that, if the Blood War turns dramatically in 
their favor, the demon princes could put the rest of their 
apocalyptic plans in motion. 
SCOURGE OF WORLDS 
You MUST UNDERSTAND THAT MY AMBITIONS DO NOT 
stop here in Doraaka, or even at the doorstep of Greyhawk 
or the Amedio jungles beyond. Oerth is but the first of many 
worlds that will fall. 
- Iuz the Old 
The Abyss and its demonic inhabitants are akin to a vi-
rus. While most other factions across the planes spread 
their influence into other realms through conquest, con-
version, or diplomacy, demons infect a world by travel-
ing there and beginning to transform their environment 
to resemble the malleable, chaotic substance of their 
home plane. If demons dwell in a place for a significant 
amount of time, the area starts to warp in response to 
the abyssal energy that churns within it. If a demonic 
infestation is left unchecked, a portal to the Abyss is the 
result, and more and more of the essence of the Abyss 
pushes its way through. In time, a plane or a world could 
become a colony of the Abyss, overrun with demons and 
devoid of all other forms of life. 
INITIAL INFECTION 
A full-fledged demonic incursion takes time to develop. 
A demon prince might rampage across a world for a few 
days or weeks before returning home, but that event 
doesn't qualify as an incursion. After the demon is ban-
ished, the world suffers no long-term effects, aside from 
the destruction wrought by the demon. 
But if demons can dwell undisturbed on a plane for a 
period of time, their continued presence begins to erode 
the barriers between their location and the Abyss. It 
can take a few years for weaker demons to warp their 
environment, while changes begin to occur around the 
location of a demon prince in about a month. 
To bring about these changes, the invaders must 
remain in the same location for some time, usually an 
area no more than six miles on a side, to combine their 
influence. Fortunately for their would-be victims, the 
chaotic evil nature of demons means that they rarely 
C HAPT ER I I THE BLOOD WAR 
organize in a way to cause such a disturbance. Demons 
that enter the world are bent on destruction, not con-
cerned with greater matters, and inclined to go their 
separate ways unless a powerful leader can keep them 
under control long enough for the virus to take hold. 
During the first stages of an abyssal incursion, the 
natural world recoils from the demonic presence. Plants 
become twisted versions of themselves. Leering faces 
appear in leaf patterns, vines writhe of their own accord, 
and trees grow foul-smelling tumors instead of leaves 
as their branches wither and die. Bodies of water in the 
area become tainted and sometimes poisonous, and the 
weather might feature extremes of heat, cold, wind, rain, 
or snow that aren't typical of the normal climate. Living 
things in the area flee or are killed by the demons. 
At this stage, natives can stop the incursion by killing 
or driving away the demons that infest the area. The ef-
fects of the event might persist for a few months or even 
centuries, but the barriers between the Abyss and the 
world remain intact. 
A GROWING MENACE 
If the first stage of the infection continues long enough, 
a portal opens in the corrupted environment that con-
nects to a random location in the Abyss. Demons that 
happen to be near the portal can travel through it and 
into the world, while the raw stuff of the Abyss also be-
gins to seep through the passage. 
Even at this stage, the infection has almost no chance 
of developing into a true incursion. The immensity of 
the Abyss means that a portal's random location is more 
likely to be an empty, uninhabited place than anything 
else, and demons can't make use of the portal unless 
they can locate it. The incursion might be long delayed 
as a result, but the portal's opening on the other plane 
remains a lurking threat until it is closed. 
As more demons find and use the portal, the Abyss 
becomes strongly linked to the world, and the region's 
transformation grows more extreme. The odd but still 
mundane weather gives way to storms that drop burning 
embers, or winds that shriek in all directions, seizing 
living creatures and hurling them against the ground. 
The environment becomes inimical to all living things. 
At this point, the incursion is still in a state of fiux. 
The demons aren't yet directed by a single will. Unless 
a powerful demon dominates all the others, the area is 
wracked by fighting as one demon after another claims 
primacy, only to be overcome. The tie to the Abyss is 
still fragile enough that, as demons are slain, the portal 
grows smaller and weaker. If the invaders are reduced 
to about half the number that were present when the 
portal was created, the opening winks out of existence. 
A STAIN ON REALITY 
In its third phase, the demonic virus invades fully and 
becomes a part of the world. Simply killing the demons 
in an afflicted area is no longer enough to remove the 
Abyss's stain.
