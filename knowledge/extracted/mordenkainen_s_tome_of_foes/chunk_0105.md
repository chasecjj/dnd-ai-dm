• The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet 
of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom 
saving throw or the balhannoth becomes invisible to 
that creature for 1 minute. This effect ends if the bal-
hannoth attacks the target. 
REGIONAL E FFECTS 
A region containing a balhannoth's lair becomes warped 
by the creature's unnatural presence, which creates one 
or more of the following effects: 
• Creatures within 1 mile of the balhannoth's lair ex-
perience a sensation of being close to whatever they 
desire most. The sensation grows stronger the closer 
the creatures come to the balhannoth's lair. 
• The balhannoth can sense the strongest desires of 
any humanoid within 1 mile of it and learns whether 
those desires involve a place: a safe location to rest, a 
temple, home, or somewhere else. 
If the balhannoth dies, these effects end immediately.

BERBALANG 
Berbalangs creep across the petrified remains of 
dead gods adrift on the Astral Plane. Obsessed with 
gathering secrets, both from the gods they inhabit and 
from the bones of dead creatures, they call forth the 
spirits of the dead and force them to divulge what they 
learned in life. 
Speakers of the Dead. Berbalangs prefer to speak 
only to dead things, and specifically only to the spirits 
they call forth in the hope of learning secrets. They 
record their stories on the bones that once belonged 
to these creatures, thus preserving the information 
they gain. 
Spectral Spy. The pursuit of knowledge drives every-
thing berbala ngs do. Although they mostly learn their 
secrets from the dead, they aren't above spying on the 
living to take knowledge from them as well. A berbal-
ang can create a spectral duplicate of itself and send 
the duplicate out to gather information on other planes 
by watching places where the gods and their servants 
gather. When a berbalang is perceiving its environment 
through its duplicate, its actual body is unconscious 
and can't protect or nourish itself. Thus, a berbalang 
typically uses its duplicate for only a short time before 
returning its consciousness to its body. 
Weird Oracles. The knowledge that 
berbalangs accumulate makes them 
great sources of information for power-
ful people traveling the planes. Berba-
langs ignore petitioners, however, unless 
they come bearing a choice secret or 
the bones of a particularly interesting 
creature. Githyanki have found a way to 
coexist with berbalangs, and sometimes 
use the creatures to spy on their ene-
mies and to watch over their creches on 
the Material Plane.

Spectral Duplicate (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). As 
a bonus action, the berbalang creates one spectral duplicate 
of itself in an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it. 
While the duplicate exists, the berbalang is unconscious. A 
berbalang can have only one duplicate at a time. The duplicate

disappears when it or the berbalang drops to 0 hit points or 
when the berbalang dismisses it (no action required). 
The duplicate has the same statistics and knowledge as 
the berbalang, and everything experienced by the duplicate is 
known by the berbalang. All damage dealt by the duplicate's 
attacks is psychic damage. 
Innate Spellcasting. The berbalang's innate spellcasting ability 
is Intelligence (spell save DC 13). The berbalang can innately 
cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: speak with dead 
l/day: plane shift (self only)
