CLOCKWORKS 
The gnomes' efforts to invent and tinker with magic and 
mechanical devices produce many failed constructs, but 
also result in genuine advances, such as clockworks. 
Since their discovery, the methods used to craft clock-
works have passed from one community of gnomes to 
another and down the generations. 
Constructed Nature. A clockwork doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep. 
BRONZE SCOUT 
A bronze scout seldom emerges from below ground; 
thanks to its telescoping eyestalks, it can observe ene-
mies at close range while most of its segmented, worm-
like body remains buried. If it is detected, the bronze 
scout deters pursuers by sending electrical shocks 
through the ground while it retreats to safety. 
IRON COBRA 
An iron cobra is exactly what its name implies: a metal 
snake with a poisonous bite. In addition to standard 
poisons, gnomes load this clockwork with alchemical 
concoctions that can paralyze creatures and cloud their 
minds with paranoia. 
OAKEN BOLTER 
No ordinary ballista, an oaken bolter is a construct ca-
pable of striking at long distances. The bolts it launches 
can rend flesh, destroy armor, or drag enemies toward 
traps or melee-oriented clockworks- and at shorter 
ranges, burst with explosive force. 
STONE DEFEN DER 
Thick plates of stone riveted onto a stone defender give 
it substantial protection and allow it to conceal itself 
against a stony surface. Its chief role isn't as an am-
busher, however, but as a bodyguard for gnomes and 
other clockworks. 
INDIVIDUAL DESIGNS 
A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork 
more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies 
too much from another creation. For that reason, even 
clockworks that fit established designs, such as those 
described here, are seldom identical. 
A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the 
following enhancements and one potential malfunction 
to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a 
pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the 
clockwork's builder.

Enhancement 
Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in 
Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, 
it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine. 
2 
Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision 
becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains pro-
ficiency in Perception ifit doesn't already have it.

3 
Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2. 
4 
Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 
10 feet. 
5 
Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resis-
tance to force, lightning, and thunder damage. 
6 
Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with 
at least l hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes 
lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the 
start of its next turn. 
7 
Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum in-
creases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice. 
8 
Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 
feet. 
9 
Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to 
speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's 
choice). 
10 
Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming 
speed of 30 feet.

Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clock-
work's turn. If you roll a l , the clockwork is blinded 
until the end of its turn. 
Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clock-
work's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes at-
tack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn. 
Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to 
lightning damage. 
Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clock· 
work's turn. If you roll al , the clockwork mistakes 
one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. 
The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 
minute or until that creature attacks it or deals dam-
age to it. 
Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clock-
work's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level 
of exhaustion that it isn't immune to. 
Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a 
straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before mov-
ing and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can 
rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its 
turn. 
Overactive Sense of Self· Preservation. If the clock-
work has half its hit points or fewer at the start of 
its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats 
from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues 
fighting. 
8 
Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's 
turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated un-
til the end of its turn. 
9 
Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on ini-
tiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet. 
10 
Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to blud-
geoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-
magical attacks that aren't adamantine.
