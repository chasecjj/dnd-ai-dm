GAERDAL lRONHAND 
The Shield of the Golden Hills, Gaerdal Ironhand, has 
no use for amusements, and she doesn't deign to smile 
at any prank except those of Gari Glittergold. Gaerdal 
obsesses about defense and vigilance, and she is an 
expert in fortification, siege tactics, combat, and traps. 
Instead of bustling about as gnome deities normally 
do, Gaerdal has a tendency to dig in and hide out, and 
in many tales Gari finds it difficult to convince her to 
leave her home to join the others on adventures. Some 
legends say this reluctance is due in part to an escapade 
that cost her the loss of her hand. Flandal and Nebelun 
worked together to replace it with a stronger one made 
of iron, but her resentment over the mishap lingers. 
Gnomes build their homes in hidden and defensible 
places because Gaerdal teaches them these techniques. 
Every secret door, spy hole, and intruder alarm in a 
gnome warren is a tribute to Gaerdal's principles. 
NEBELUN 
Nebelun, also known as the Meddler, is fearless, per-
haps foolishly so. Every invention of Nebelun's starts 
with a wild idea, nothing goes entirely according to plan, 
and her greatest exploits often spring from mistakes. 
Who else would stroll in and steal Semuanya's tail as 
the lizard folk god splashed in his favorite pool? Who 
else would use Thor's hammer to pound a nail and thus 
be inspired to invent the lightning rod? Gari never needs 
to persuade Nebelun to join an excursion, but he and 
the rest of the pantheon do have to focus her attention 
on the task at hand, so that her madcap inventiveness 
doesn't derail the effort. 
All gnomes see Nebelun as the delightful spirit of 
invention and discovery, even those whose livelihoods 
have nothing to do with the construction of odd devices. 
Any accident that fortuitously results in a new discovery 
might be credited to Nebelun's benevolent meddling in 
the affairs of mortal gnomes. 
SEGOJAN EARTHCALLER 
The gnomes know Segojan Earthcaller as a kind, 
modest hero. He is said to be the best cook among the 
gnome gods and to have the power to heal any sickness, 
because he knows the medicinal and culinary uses of 
every creature and plant that lives underground. During 
the misadventures of the gnome pantheon, Segojan 
contributes to the group through his healing abilities 
and the restorative power of his meals, and on many 
occasions the other gnome gods call upon him to use his 
ability to burrow through any substance. 
G IFTS FROM TH E Goos 
The gnome gods enjoy traveling about the multiverse in 
the guise of ordinary gnomes. Those who offer them aid 
or treat them with respect might receive a modest token 
of appreciation in return. Sometimes the deity reveals it-
self before giving the gift, and sometimes the item simply 
appears on the recipient's pillow or in a loot sack. Typical 
gifts include a golden whistle that can mimic any bird 
song, a clockwork beetle made of silver that can fly and 
obey simple commands, and a seed that, when planted, 
grows into a miniature fruit tree and bears fruit within a 
few hours. 
CHAPTER 5 I TTALFL!NGS AND GNOMES 
Forest gnomes believe that their ability to speak with 
burrowing animals comes from Segojan. All gnomes 
see Segojan as a healer of the sick and a protector of 
the hearth. He is also revered in his role as a guide for 
gnomish souls after death, as long as the body is buried 
before worms claim it. If a gnome's body isn't entrusted 
to Segojan by interring it, the soul is forced to find its 
own way to the afterlife. 
URDLEN 
Many pantheons include in their number a miscreant or 
an outlier-someone not to be emulated in the custom-
ary way, and often an entity whose existence serves as 
an object lesson and an example of what befalls mortals 
who conduct themselves the same way. For the gnomes, 
this niche is filled by Urdlen, also known as the Glutton 
for its selfish and cruel behavior. 
Though the details differ from telling to telling, all 
gnomes know the story of how Gari banished Urdlen 
from the Golden Hills because Urdlen refused to go on 
an important quest. Despite Garl's efforts and the pleas 
of the rest of the pantheon, Urdlen selfishly refused to 
set his own interests aside and contribute to the group. 
Every version of this story ends in some sort of trag-
edy- perhaps the loss of Gaerdal's hand, the affliction 
that caused Flandal to need new skin, or the disappear-
ance ofBaravar's shadow- and each one concludes with 
"And that is why Gari sent Urdlen into exile." In tales 
of his later life, Urdlen is no longer a gnome but has 
become a greedy and destructive monster, a great blind 
and hairless mole with iron claws and teeth. 
Gnomes believe that Urdlen exerts influence on their 
lives when they experience jealousy, greed, petulance, 
or envy. Individuals are more likely to fall prey to these 
feelings when they don't spend enough time in activities 
with others, and so tales of Urdlen serve as a somber 
reminder of the importance of participating in society. 
THE GOLDEN HILLS 
Seven hills set in a ring on Dothion, the more pastoral 
half of the plane of Bytopia, are the homes of the gnome 
gods. Each one of the Golden Hills, described below, is 
the domain of a certain deity, except for Callarduran, 
who dwells deep beneath them all in a set of caverns 
called Deephome: 
Glitterhome. Garl's hill is no larger than the rest, but 
it glows more brightly than the others beneath the 
light of the eternal sunset that gives the place its 
name. Yet the true "glitter" lies inside- treasures from 
Garl's many adventures, displayed in a hall tiled with 
gemstones. 
The Mithral Forge. Mines containing every kind of min-
eral run throughout Flandal's hill, which also features 
tunnels that lead to large ore deposits on other planes. 
When Flandal is at work, the whole hill vibrates to the 
rhythm of his hammer working at the forge for which 
his hill is named. 
The Hidden Knoll. Baravar conceals the entrance to 
her hill with illusions and riddles, never allowing any 
who visit her to enter twice by the same way. Those 
who persevere through her trickery to discover her in-
ner sanctum might be rewarded with a treasure.
