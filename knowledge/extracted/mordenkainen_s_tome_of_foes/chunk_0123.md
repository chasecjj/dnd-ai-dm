REGIONAL EFFECT S 
The region containing Baphomet's lair is warped by his 
magic, creating one or more of the following effects: 
Plant life within 1 mile of the lair grows thick and 
forms walls of trees, hedges, and other flora in the 
form of small mazes. 
Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become frightened and 
disoriented, as though constantly under threat of be-
ing hunted, and might lash out or panic even when no 
visible threat is nearby. 
If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile 
of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 
Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness 
determined by the Madness of Baphomet table. A 
creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be 
affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours. 
If Baphomet dies, these effects fade over the course of 
ldlO days.

Charge. If Baphomet moves at least 10 feet straight toward a 
target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the 
target takes an extra 16 (3dl 0) piercing damage. If the target is 
a creature, it must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw 
or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone. 
Innate Spellcasting. Baphomet's spellcasting ability is Cha-
risma (spell save DC 18). He can innately cast the following 
spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: detect magic 
3/day each: dispel magic, dominate beast, hunter's mark, maze, 
wall of stone 
1/day: teleport 
Labyrinthine Recall. Baphomet can perfectly recall any path he 
has traveled, and he is immune to the maze spell. 
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Baphomet fails a saving throw, 
he can choose to succeed instead. 
MADNESS OF BAPHOMET 
If a creature goes mad in Baphomet's lair or within 
line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of 
Baphomet table to determine the nature of the madness, 
which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the 
Dungeon Master's Guide for more on madness.

like a wild animal than a thinking being." 
41- 60 
"The world is my hunting ground. Others are my 
prey."

"Hate comes easily to me and explodes into rage."

"I see those who oppose me not as people, but as 
beasts meant to be preyed upon." 
Magic Resistance. Baphomet has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Magic Weapons. Baphomet's weapon attacks are magical. 
Reckless. At the start of his turn, Baphomet can gain advantage 
on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack 
rolls against him have advantage until the start of his next turn. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. Baphomet makes three attacks: one with Heart-
cleaver, one with his bite, and one with his gore attack . 
Heartc/eaver. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one

Frightful Presence. Each creature of Baphomet's choice within 
120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 18 
Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for l minute. A 
frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. These 
later saves have disadvantage if Baphomet is within line of 
sight of the creature. 
If a creature succeeds on any of these saves or the effect ends 
on it, the creature is immune to Baphomet's Frightful Presence 
for the next 24 hours. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
Baphomet can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the op-
tions below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a

Heartcleaver.
