MAUREZHI 
When Doresain, the King of Ghouls, corrupted a society 
of elves, he created a new breed of demons to lead packs 
of ghouls and ghasts in the material world . 
H orrid Infiltrator s. When a maurezhi consumes the 
corpse of a humanoid it has slain- a process that takes 
about 10 minutes- it instantly assumes the creature's 
appearance as it was in life. The new appearance begins 
to rot away over the next few days, eventually revealing 
the demon's original form. 
A Pla~ue of Ghouls. Maurezhi are contagion incar-
nate. Their bite attacks can drain a victim's sense of self. 
If this affliction is allowed to go far enough, the victim is 
infected with an unholy hunger for flesh that overpowers 
their personality and transforms them into a ghoul.

Assume Form. The maurezhi can assume the appearance of any 
Medium humanoid it has eaten. It remains in this form for ld6 
days, during which time the form gradually decays until, when 
the effect ends, the form sloughs from the demon's body. 
Magic Resistance. The maurezhi has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The maurezhi makes two attacks: one with its bite 
and one with its claws. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 14 (2dl0 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, 
its Charisma score is reduced by ld4. This reduction lasts until 
the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if this 
reduces its Charisma to 0. It rises 24 hours later as a ghoul, un· 
less it has been revived or its corpse has been destroyed. 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature 
other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution 
saving throw or be paralyzed for l minute. The target can re· 
peat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the 
effect on itself on a success. 
Raise Ghoul (Recharge 5-6). The maurezhi targets one dead 
ghoul or ghast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target is

MOLYDEUS 
The most ruthless and dangerous of demons-more 
feared than the dreaded balor- the molydeus speaks 
with the authority of the demon lord it serves as it en-
forces its master's will. Standing some 12 feet tall, a 
molydeus has a red-skinned, humanoid body and two 
heads- one that of a slavering wolf and the other that 
of a serpent with dripping fangs perched atop a long 
neck. Molydei might guard their masters' possessions, 
roam the battlefields of the Abyss to ensure the loyalty of 
troops, or bring swift death to their enemies. 
Branded and Bound. When a demon earns the at-
tention of a demon lord through ferocity, cunning, or an 
act of surprising devotion, the demon lord might reward 
such service by snatching up the fiend and subjecting it 
to excruciating torments to remake it into a molydeus. 
Voice of the Master. A demon lord has a direct link 
to its molydeus and uses the serpent head to communi-
cate its wishes. A molydeus is, therefore, said to utter 
its master's will, commanding other demons to carry 
out orders and using violence to ensure they obey. A 
molydeus must constantly be ready for the scrutiny of its 
master, for the demon lord can decide at any moment to 
observe the molydeus through the serpent. Thus, there 
is no room for treachery in a molydeus.

Innate Spellcasting. The molydeus's innate spellcasting ability 
is Charisma (spell save DC 22). It can innately cast the follow-
ing spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: dispel magic, polymorph, telekinesis, teleport 
3/day: lightning bolt 
1/day: imprisonment 
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the molydeus fails a saving 
throw, it can choose to succeed instead. 
Magic Resistance. The molydeus has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. 
Magic Weapons. The molydeus's weapon attacks are magical. 
CHAPTER 6 I BESTI ARY 
VARIANT: DEMON SUMMONING 
You can give a molydeus the ability to summon 
other demons. 
Summon Demon (1 /Day). As an action, the molydeus 
has a SO percent chance of summoning its choice of ld6 
babaus, ld4 chasmes, or one marilith. A summoned 
demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of 
the molydeus, acts as an ally of the molydeus, and can't 
summon other demons. It remains for l minute, until it or 
the molydeus dies, or until the molydeus dismisses it as 
an action. 
Special Weapon. As part of a demon lord's trust in 
its molydeus, it bestows a powerful weapon upon the 
guardian demon. The demon lord fashions the weapon 
from a portion of the fiend's essence, so that the demon 
and its weapon are forever bound. If the molydeus dies, 
the weapon dissolves into a pool of foul-smelling slime. 
It's possible to steal such a weapon, but a molydeus de-
prived of its weapon will stop at nothing to regain it. 
The weapon a molydeus wields reflects the nature of 
its master. Those that serve Baphomet carry a glaive; 
Demogorgon, a whip; Fraz-Urb'luu, a battleaxe; Graz'zt, 
a greatsword; Orcus, a morningstar; and Yeenoghu, a 
flail. The weapon's form doesn't affect its capabilities. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The molydeus makes three attacks: one with its 
weapon, one with its wolf bite, and one with its snakebite. 
Demonic Weapon. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 
1 S ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2dl0 + 9) slashing damage. If the 
target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on 
the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't 
survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if 
it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge 
or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage 
from the hit. 
Wolf Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) piercing damage. 
Snakebite. Melee Weapon Attack: +1 6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one 
creature. Hit: 12 (ld6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target 
must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or its hit 
point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage 
taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. 
The target transforms into a manes if this reduces its hit point 
maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a 
wish spell. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The molydeus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from 
the options below. Only one legendary action option can be 
used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. 
The molydeus regains spent legendary actions at the start 
of its turn. 
Attack. The molydeus makes one attack, either with its de-
monic weapon or with its snakebite. 
Move. The molydeus moves without provoking opportu· 
nity attacks. 
Cast a Spell. The molydeus casts one spell from its Innate 
Spellcasting trait.
