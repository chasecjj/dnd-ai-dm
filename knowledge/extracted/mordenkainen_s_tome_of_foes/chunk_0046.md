Worship of That Which Lurks is widespread in the 
Underdark. Not just drow pay respect to it. Even crea-
tures that are considered to be mindless, such as ooz.es 
and jellies, sometimes behave in ways that seem consis-
tent with reverence for That Which Lurks. 
Those who are faithful to Lolth often oppose Ghau-
nadaur's cultists, driving them into hiding or forcing 
them into open conflict. Some priestesses and scholars 
believe that this enmity exists because Ghaunadaur 
betrayed Lolth shortly after she betrayed Corellon. In 
these legends, Ghaunadaur tried to curry favor with 
Corellon and recapture his earlier formless nature by 
turning on Lolth. Ghaunadaur's double act of betrayal 
brought retribution from both gods, and he was cast 
down into the world as a skinless, boneless mass. Other 
stories portray Ghaunadaur as an incredibly ancient and 
ineffable deity, one of the so-called Great Old Ones. Both 
claims might have merit, because the truth about the 
time of the birth of gods can never be known for certain. 
KEPTOLO 
KEPTOLO SHOWS THE WAY. FEED THE VANITY OF YOUR 
mistress, and all her treasures shall be yours. Be careful 
whomyou offend, and keep an expendable companion 
nearby to hold culpable for your crimes. Gossip can be as 
dead(y as the venom on an assassin's blade. Use the poison 
of words to destroy your rivals, that you may claim for 
yourself all they once presumed was theirs. 
-Tezzeryn, Head Consort of House Bhaerynden, 
instructing his son 
The ideal of what a male drow can become, Keptolo is 
handsome, stylish, witty, hedonistic, an outrageous flat-
terer, and sought after as a lover. He is also dangerous 
in his aspects as a subtle assassin and a whisperer of ru-
mors. For those attributes, he is worshiped by ambitious 
males who hope to emulate him. Some succeed admi-
rably and achieve great things beyond the reach of most 
males, but many more succumb to excesses of the flesh, 
dissipation, and disease, or they are ruined or murdered 
by a rival- who is also a true disciple of Keptolo. 
In most myths, Keptolo resides in the Demonweb Pits 
alongside Lolth, whom he serves as consort, more than 
a plaything but much less than an equal. Keptolo is a bit-
ter enemy of Zinzerena, who deceives and uses him as a 
tool in many of the stories about the Dark Seldarine. 
KIARANSALEE 
The drow god of vengeance and undeath, called the 
Revenancer, is portrayed in some legends as a fierce 
female clad in silver and translucent veils, and in others 
as a banshee. In either version, her hands bear many 
glittering silver rings, and this image is recognized as 
her symbol. 
Drow see Kiaransalee as the patron of vengeance be-
cause she is said to have died and returned from death 
to get her revenge, bringing an army of the dead back 
with her. Various communities of her worshipers have 
differing ideas about who killed her and why, but typi-
cally the murderer is portrayed as having the features 
CHAPT.ER 2 I El.YES 
of some kind of creature the drow have great hatred 
for. Followers of Kiaransalee don't trouble themselves 
greatly over these details, because all the stories could 
be true: the Revenancer is believed to have returned 
from death over and over again. 
Vengeance is the aspect of Kiaransalee that appeals to 
most drow, because it becomes a necessity in every am-
bitious drow's life-usually more than once. The state of 
undeath is of less concern to them, but those who prac-
tice necromancy turn to Kiaransalee for guidance and 
for protection from undead. Some of her most fervent 
followers seek out the secret of attaining undeath for 
themselves. Kiaransalee favors them by bringing them 
back as undead, but unlike other gods of similar sort, 
Kiaransalee doesn't offer the undeath of lichdom but a 
lowly existence as a banshee, a revenant, or a wight. 
Drow believe that Kiaransalee was driven mad by re-
turning from death as a god so many times, but her fol-
lowers aren't discouraged by this assessment. Despite 
her madness, her actions are guided by a deep and devi-
ous cunning- a trait that drow attach more importance 
to than they do to sanity. 
MALYK 
Malyk embodies rebellion and chaos. Drow know of his 
influence from the appearance of wild mages among 
their number. Such an individual, possessed of sorcer-
ous powers seemingly bestowed at random, is often 
seen as a threat to the established order. Many drow, 
especially males and even females of low station, try to 
attract Malyk's attention by secretly making sacrifices to 
him. Meanwhile, house matrons and others steeped in 
the faith of Lolth attempt to purge Malyk's worship from 
drow society- at the same time that some of them pray 
to him for power. 
Malyk is associated with rebellion because when a 
wild mage's true nature is revealed, the individual often 
has no recourse but to openly attack others and create 
chaos. Most other drow vie to receive Lolth's blessing 
by being the one to bring such a blasphemer to justice. 
In order to survive, a wild mage must defeat or elude 
all attackers and forge an alliance with those who can 
be threatened or bribed to provide a safe haven. Most 
wild mages who are discovered are put to death, some 
survive as outcasts, and a rare few rise to positions of 
status, declaring their allegiance to Lolth- or at least 
pretending to. 
SELVETARM 
Drow regard Selvetarm as the Champion of Loi th and 
the patron of drow warriors. He is portrayed as an eight-
armed drow that represents the epitome of fighting 
prowess. But Lolth rarely looses her champion to do her 
bidding, keeping him snared by unbreakable webs that 
she removes only in times of direst need.
