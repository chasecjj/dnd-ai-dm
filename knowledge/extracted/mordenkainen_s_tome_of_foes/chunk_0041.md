elf wizards of FaerOn summoned into the world a piece 
of Arvandor and bound it there. Their intent was to craft 
a new homeland for the elves, a place protected from the 
outside world and so similar to their afterlife as to allow 
elves to live in a virtual heaven on earth. 
Although the performance of the ritual was an act 
of supreme sacrilege, it didn't bring divine retribution 
down on those responsible. Perhaps the Seldarine 
deemed the consequences of the act to be punishment 
enough. The ritual ripped continents apart. It shifted 
seas. The lives lost couldn't be counted. Even time and 
space were, for a time, torn asunder. This event was the 
first Sundering of FaerOn, and the world was forever 
changed by it. 
Millennia later, Evermeet still exists, although now it 
is unmoored from the world, somewhere in the space 
between the Feywild, Arvandor, and the Material Plane. 
By using secret pathways, entering a fairy ring on spe-
cial nights, or traversing a moonlit sea by following cer-
tain stars, elves of many worlds can get to Evermeet-if 
they're lucky. Even from FaerOn, for instance, one can 
sail to Ever meet only on a ship captained by an elf who 
has been there before. And if the captain slips up, the 
ship might become adrift on the Astral Plane. 
Despite all these obstacles, when elves feel the pull of 
Arvandor, some find the way to assuage that feeling by 
traveling to Evermeet instead. Unlike on Arvandor, elves 
who visit Evermeet can do so for as long as they like and 
leave when they want- or can choose to stay, as many 
elves do in the later decades of their lives. 
The arrival of elves from worlds other than FaerOn is 
a phenomenon of just the last few decades. When Ever-
meet became detached from Faerun, it also lost its great 
queen, Amlaruil Moonflower, said to have been invested 
with powers by all of the Seldarine. Her throne 
has sat empty ever since. The consensus of the 
ruling houses in Evermeet is that the Seldarine 
now want Evermeet to be open to all elves and 
not ruled by any single mortal. 
ELADRIN AND THE 
FEYWILD 
The Feywild exists separate from but parallel 
to the Material Plane. It's a realm of nature run 
amok, and most of its inhabitants are sylvan or fey 
creatures. In these respects, the Feywild has certain 
similarities to Arvandor. First-time visitors might be ex-
cused for not being sure which of the two planes they're 
on for a time after arriving. Unlike Arvandor, however, 
which is a plane of good, the Feywild leans toward nei-
ther good nor evil; both are equally prevalent and pow-
erful there. For that reason, parts of the Feywild where 
evil holds sway are substantially more dangerous than 
any place in Arvandor. 
All kinds of elves live in the Feywild, but one sub-
race- the eladrin- has adopted it as their home. Of all 
the elves, eladrin are closest in form and ability to the 
first generation of elves. Some could pass for high elves, 
but most are distinctly eladrin in appearance: very slen-
der, with hair and skin color determined by the season 
with which they feel the closest affinity. And their eyes 
often glimmer with fey magic.
