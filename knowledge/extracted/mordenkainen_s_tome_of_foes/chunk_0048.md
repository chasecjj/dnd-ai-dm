H O LES I N LOLT H 'S WEB 
Lolth is far from omniscient, despite what her priestesses 
say. There are drow who live without bending to the tyr-
anny of her worship. Communities of renegades who 
dispute Lolth's primacy often raise another of the Dark 
Seldarine up as their patron. Although this amounts to ex-
changing one evil oppressor for another, any escape from 
Lolth's web can feel like freedom. 
The Acropolis ofThanatos, erected in the ruins of a 
drow city wiped out by plague in the Underdark of FaerOn, 
was home to a drow settlement of a few thousand ruled 
by necromancer clerics of Kiaransalee. It existed for a few 
decades before worshipers of Lolth and worshipers of Eil-
istraee teamed up to eliminate its leaders. 
never portrayed unmasked, and partly because anonym-
ity is a wise precaution when one challenges the social 
structure of the drow in even a small way. 
To quash any challenge to the matriarchy that Vhaer-
aun might inspire in his followers, some drow commu-
nities preach that he wears a mask to hide the terrible 
scars from the wounds inflicted on him by Lolth as pun-
ishment for his arrogance. His silence, too, is part of his 
punishment, for his tongue was removed for questioning 
Lolth's orders. Worshipers of Vhaeraun who believe this 
dogma sometimes ritually scar and silence themselves 
as signs of their devotion, and then serve as voiceless, 
masked bodyguards for the matrons of their house. 
ZINZERENA 
As the patron of assassination, illusions, and lies, 
Zinzerena personifies cruelty, stealth, misdirection, and 
survival by any means necessary. In some ways, Malyk 
is her reflection, and in many interpretations of the 
age-old stories, the two gods are siblings or lovers. But 
Zinzerena is more palatable to female drow than Malyk, 
and she condones the study of arcane magic. 
The liturgy of Zinzerena is passed on in the form of 
folk tales, for her faith has no place among the lead-
ership of drow society. Her tales usually describe her 
hiding and waiting until her foes are weakened or lax 
in their attention before she attacks. Those who respect 
or revere Zinzerena are almost always of modest social 
status, or worse. Even the most prestigious of noble 
estates, where a high priestess reigns supreme, might 
have a number of her followers among the commoners 
who work as servants and staff. Only the most capri-
cious of nobles would enter her priesthood, though 
some have done so. Inevitably, when such traitors are 
discovered, they are cast out from their houses. Ironi-
cally, these maverick nobles often become leading fig-
ures in Zinzerena's cult, for they are the best educated 
and most politically experienced of her followers. Her 
adherents come from a wide range of occupations, in-
cluding common thieves, laborers, guides, physicians, 
poets, and nearly any other profession. What they all 
share is a rebellious spirit and a desire for change. 
In some stories, Zinzerena is Lolth's daughter, who 
was spirited away and hidden from her by iJlusions. 
In other tales, she begins life as a mortal elf who uses 
glamors to trick her way into the company of the gods. 
Regardless, Zinzerena always has some element of 
illusion magic about her, and she uses it and other de-
CH1\ PTER 2 I ELVES 
ceptions to get the better of more powerful opponents. 
Deceit and taking advantage of others' weaknesses are 
recurring themes in the tales of her exploits. The only 
figure in the Dark Seldarine immune to Zinzerena's de-
ceptions is Lolth, although even the Queen of Spiders is 
sometimes tricked when Zinzerena shifts blame for her 
actions onto others. 
Not many female drow devote their lives to the study 
of magic, because it's held to be a low-status avocation 
more suited to males. Most females who pursue it seri-
ously do so in secret. Even rumors that a drow matron 
practices arcane magic, if they aren't quashed, can sab-
otage her standing in society. Yet there's no denying that 
knowledge of arcane magic could be a great boon to an 
ambitious female. Zinzerena's worshipers encourage 
this pursuit and offer tutelage and tools in exchange for 
a candidate's alliance with Zinzerena's secret cult. 
EILISTRAEE 
Most drow know nothing of Eilistraee. Matron mothers 
of the most powerful houses closely guard the scrolls 
that chronicle her existence. They retain them for the 
sake of remaining aware of the enemy they describe: a 
drow god who would spirit away all of Lolth's worship-
ers to the surface world. 
The matron mothers warn those who go to the surface 
on raids to retreat if they can see the moon- practical 
advice, it would seem. But an equally important reason 
is that Eilistraee is known to work her wiles under the 
light of the moon, so that drow are more susceptible to 
her lure at such times. The matrons also direct the raid-
ers to flee back underground if any of their number hear 
music they find appealing, such as a parent's lullaby 
or the chorus of a rousing song carried on the mind, 
because Eilistraee's call to drow who would be free of 
Lolth's web is often delivered within dulcet tunes that 
aren't of otherworldly origin. 
Eilistraee is a god of moonlight, song, dance, and, 
most important, the rejection of the evil ways of Loi th. 
Drow who feel like outsiders in their society, who react 
with disgust to the evils perpetrated by their kind, who 
come to the surface and fall in love with the stars- these 
are the ones who might be pleased to hear Eilistraee's 
call. If they respond to it by going to the surface and 
staying there, Eilistraee offers no guarantee of their 
safety and no promise of acceptance in the world above. 
But she opens her followers' hearts to the wonder of the 
nature in the night, and her songs and signs can show a 
drow how to persevere in that alien environment. 
The scrolls that the matron mothers guard so closely 
attest that Eilistraee turned against Lolth but knew 
better than to seek solace among the Seldarine. Her po-
sition among the other drow gods remains uncertain, as 
is the fate of the souls of those who turn to her worship. 
Drow who are beloved by Eilistraee sometimes appear 
to vanish when they die, as the body dissolves into pale 
light and leaves no clue to where the soul has gone. 
VULKOOR 
Drow of the world of Eberron worship a scorpion-god 
named Vulkoor, which is their world's equivalent of 
Lolth. Vulkoor is often portrayed or envisioned as a 
giant scorpion or as a hybrid creature with the head,
