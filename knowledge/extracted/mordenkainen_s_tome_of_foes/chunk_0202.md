YAGNOLOTH 
Anyone who would contract yugoloths for a task usually 
ends up dealing with a yagnoloth. Cunning negotiators, 
these strange fiends handle the writing of contracts for 
all of their kind. Once a yagnoloth is hired, it communi-
cates its employer's desires to the fiends it commands. 
Although they are entrusted with leading lesser yu-
goloths, yagnoloths ultimately take their orders from 
arcanaloths and ultroloths. Aside from their superiors, 
yagnoloths have full authority over and expect obedi-
ence from the fiends under their command. A yagnoloth 
follows the dictates in a contract it negotiated, but it is 
certain to have included a loophole to escape its obliga-
tion if the situation warrants. 
A yagnoloth has one arm of human size and one 
giant-sized arm, and it always covers one or the other 
with a long cape. During negotiations, the yagnoloth 
uncovers its human arm and uses it to draft and sign 
contracts. When a show of force is necessary or when 
combat is joined, it shifts its cape to reveal its brutally 
powerful giant appendage.

ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The yagnoloth makes one massive arm attack 
and one electrified touch attack, or it makes one massive arm 
attack and teleports before or after the attack. 
Electrified Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., 
one target. Hit: 27 (6d8) lightning damage. 
Massive Arm. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one 
target. Hit: 23 (3dl2 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a 
creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw 
or become stunned until the end of the yagnoloth's next turn. 
Life Leech. The yagnoloth touches one incapacitated creature 
within 15 feet of it. The target takes 36 (7d8 + 4) necrotic dam-
age, and the yagnoloth gains temporary hit points equal to half 
the damage dealt. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Consti-
tution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an 
amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until 
the target finishes a long rest, and the target dies if its hit point 
maximum is reduced to 0. 
Battle.field Cunning (Recharge 4- 6). Up to two allied yugoloths 
within 60 feet of the yagnoloth that can hear it can use their 
reactions to make one melee attack each. 
Teleport. The yagnoloth magically teleports, along with any 
equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccu-
pied space it can see.
