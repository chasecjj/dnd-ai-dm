THE UNKNOWABLE ABYSS 
The Abyss is a puzzle to those who study demons and 
an attraction for those who seek power. It isn't as purely 
chaotic as Limbo nor as pliable, and yet demon lords 
can shape its essence by their subconscious will. Some 
demon lords emerge from the planar stuff, others seem 
to have been in existence since the start of time, and 
still others are interlopers from outside the Abyss. Sev-
eral theories exist about what principles dictate who can 
gain a demon lord's power, or, if no such principles exist, 
how that power might be seized. 
Most mortals would rather be annihilated than have 
their souls travel to the Abyss, but some see its chaos as 
something that can be harnessed and manipulated by 
those of sufficient will. A powerful soul might be able to 
dominate demons, retrieve weapons of the Blood War 
to use in mortal conflicts, or discover spells known only 
in the Abyss- and the madly ambitious might even seek 
out the means of becoming a demon lord. 
EVER- CHANGING LAYERS 
The physical nature of the Abyss is something that few 
mortal minds can understand. Those who discuss such 
matters use the term "layer" to define a certain part of 
this infinite expanse. That nomenclature, to the extent 
that it implies a particular configuration, is misleading. 
The Abyss is a chaotic tangle of miniature worlds, 
each one shaped by the demon lord that claims primacy 
over it. Within the layers it controls, a demon lord ma-
nipulates conditions to match its view of how that world 
best serves the lord's desires. 
Of course, keeping control of a layer involves fighting 
off other demons that are looking to expand their do-
mains. From time to time, a layer changes hands or is 
seemingly obliterated in a battle (perhaps to be reborn 
in another location). For this reason, imposing a sense 
of order on the relationship between the Abyss's layers 
is a fool's errand. All that can be determined at any 
given time is which lord holds sway over which parts 
of the Abyss, and which areas are being contested by 
two or more lords. And as soon as such a fact becomes 
known, it might already be obsolete. 
GETTING AROUND 
Portals connect various locations in the Abyss, but these 
passages are as unreliable as anything else in this envi-
ronment. Most of them fluctuate, sometimes winking in 
and out of existence or connecting to different layers at 
random. Rituals exist that travelers can use to attune a 
portal to a certain domain. However, the exact specifica-
tions of such a ritual vary for each potential destination. 
CHAPTER l I TH.k. BLOOD \\AR 
Those who would navigate the Abyss always enter the 
place in a random location. From there, they must locate 
a portal and then perform the ritual that enables them to 
find a specific destination. Escaping the Abyss likewise 
requires knowledge of the specific ritual needed to do 
so. Without it, visitors are trapped unless they have ac-
cess to magic that permits travel between planes. 
EVIL I NCHOATE 
I WILL BE THE LAST CREATURE WHEN I AM DONE. THE 
cosmos will then be perfect.free of the braying abomina-
tions that are all other living things. 
- Orcus 
As beings of utter chaos and absolute evil, demons have 
no concept of empathy. Each demon believes that only 
its needs and desires matter. 
This self-centeredness applies even with regard to 
other demons. These fiends have no particular affinity 
for their own kind, which is the biggest reason why they 
seldom cooperate with one another unless they are 
forced to submit to a demon lord or other leader. 
Going even farther, every demon sees itself as the 
rightful inheritor of the cosmos. It is driven to destroy 
all other living creatures, or at least command their 
absolute loyalty. In due time, the laws of the universe 
will bend to its will, shifting to bring about its vision of a 
world of absolute perfection with the demon at its center. 
ONE COSMOS, INFINITE VISIONS 
All demons seek to satisfy their whims and force others 
around them to serve their purposes. What specifically 
motivates a demon varies greatly from one to another 
and often changes within the same demon, but it is al-
ways attached to fulfillment of its desires. 
Less intelligent and less powerful demons typically 
have correspondingly modest visions for what it means 
to be the center of their universes. All demons have an 
instinctive sense of their own status, and they typically 
don't set impossible goals-a lesser demon, for instance, 
might simply run amok when unleashed into the world, 
its only desire to spread chaos, but a marilith or other 
powerful demon usually has an intent that goes beyond 
merely causing carnage, and a plan to achieve it. 
DEMONIC AMULETS: BLESSING AND CURSE 
Some demon lords have a way of cheating death, but this 
great benefit doesn't come without its own perils. A de-
mon that stores part of its essence in a demonic amulet 
can avoid being destroyed even if it is killed in the Abyss. 
On the other hand, anyone else who lays claim to such an 
item can command the demon to do as they wish. 
For this reason, demon lords hide their amulets away 
and trust no one, not even their followers, with knowledge 
of the location. Such a site is usually protected with in-
tricate traps, mindless servants, and other defenses that 
bring no risk of subversion or betrayal. 
If an archdevil were ever to acquire a demonic amulet, 
that event could signal a tipping point in the Blood War. If 
Asmodeus held Demogorgon's amulet, for instance, the 
demon lord might find itself in a position from which there 
is no escape.
