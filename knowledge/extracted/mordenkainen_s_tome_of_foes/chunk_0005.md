little longer, and it will inform you that you are alive only 
because of the devils' heroic efforts. If there was truly

devils' role in preserving the cosmos. 
THE D EMO NIC P O I NT OF V I EW 
WHY DO WE DESCEND UPON THE DOMAIN OF OUR HATED 
enemies? Because that's where the fighting is! 
-Zaadaaak, demon of the Abyss 
Most other creatures believe demons to be little more 
than mindless engines of destruction and violence. If 
that supposition were true, the Blood War should have 
ended long ago, since the tactical and strategic genius 
of the archdevils would have made quick work of the 
hordes that erupt from the Abyss. In fact, even though 
demons are quintessentially chaotic, their evilness 
combines with that outlook to produce a fiendish, subtle 
shrewdness. Demon lords and other powerful entities 
exert control over their armies that enables the forces to 
accomplish goals that would be beyond the capabilities 
of a leaderless mob. To the demons that have intelli-
gence enough to appreciate their role in it, the Blood 
War offers an endless source of diversion underscored 
by resentment of a cosmic order that refuses to admit 
their superiority. 
As the devils have surmised, the demons invade 
Avernus because it is easily accessible from the Abyss. 
But some sages and demonologists maintain that even 
if that were not the case, the Nine Hells would still be 
the demons' prime target. If the demons sent out a large 
force to invade a different plane, this theory holds, the 
devils would be able to marshal allies from across all 
the planes to rise up against the Abyss and end its threat 
forever. Instead, as long as the demons focus most of 
Yu c o LOTH s : FICKLE A LLIES 
Yugoloths are major players on both sides of the Blood 
War. The death of a yugoloth is meaningless when it 
occurs in the Abyss or the Nine Hells, and thus these 
mercenaries freely give their all in any battle even when it 
means fighting other yugoloths. Demons and devils both 
know that a yugoloth's loyalty is constantly for sale-even 
during a conflict on the battlefield- and a yugoloth never 
agrees to a contract that prohibits it from seeking a better 
offer. This set of circumstances prompts hellish and abys-
sal armies to carry war chests with them in the hope of 
buying the services of the yugoloths on the other side. The 
war chests themselves thus become highly prized targets, 
which in turn leads to protective measures, such as valu-
ables hidden in bags of holding or empty treasure contain-
ers used to lure the enemy into a trap. 
Regardless of the side that hires them, yugoloths almost 
never fight on their home plane of Gehenna despite the 
fact that both sides sometimes traverse it and many bat-
tles of the Blood War are fought there. A yugoloth killed in 
Gehenna can't be restored to life except through an excep-
tional ritual, so the sums required to entice one to fight 
on its home plane are astronomical ... and making such a 
bargain always draws the attention of the ultroloths. 
C l!APTER I I THE BLOOD WAR 
their efforts on the doorstep of the Nine Hells, realms 
such as the Seven Heavens and Bytopia are loath to 
commit aid to defend a plane that is inimical to every-
thing they stand for by aiding the devils directly. 
Therefore, the demons assault the Nine Hells over and 
over not only because it is the greatest threat to their do-
minion, but also because striking in force anywhere else 
would play into the devils' hands. 
THE B A LANCE 
The demons and the devils both foresee their own 
versions of the future of the multiverse- a cosmos in 
which one side or the other triumphs in the Blood War 
and rules for the rest of eternity. A third point of view 
exists, held by those who take both sides at their word 
and strive to make sure that neither outcome ever 
comes to pass. 
The adherents of this viewpoint refer to the concept 
they espouse as the Balance, and they seek to maintain 
equilibrium across the cosmos above all. Mordenkainen 
and his compatriots are among its most notable devo-
tees. Since a true appreciation of the Balance and its im-
plications requires a grasp of events on a cosmic level, 
very few people or entities fully embrace the idea. Those 
few, however, make up a formidable force that can mix 
martial and magical power to keep the extremists of the 
Blood War in check. 
To an outside observer, a disciple of the Balance might 
act cruelly or heartlessly one day, and benevolent and 
caring the next. A follower might aid in consigning one 
city to domination by a devil cult while driving demonic 
cultists from another. For the sake of the Balance, the 
cosmos must remain in a static state where neither de-
mon nor devil can permanently gain the upper hand. 
Keepers of the Balance sometimes resort to strate-
gies that seem inexplicable to those who don't grasp 
the whole situation. A crusading paladin might be dis-
couraged from seeking out and defeating Demogorgon, 
because doing so could weaken the Abyss enough to 
allow the forces of the Nine Hells to gain a firm foothold 
there. An adherent of the Balance might vie with a great 
arcanist as both search for knowledge of a ritual that 
would cripple Asmodeus for a short time. The arcanist 
correctly believes that performing the ritual would free 
a world of the Material Plane from the devils' taint, but 
doesn't appreciate that it also would bring a grievous 
setback to the forces that had been keeping the demons 
from overrunning Avernus. 
Those who vow to maintain the Balance make ene-
mies wherever they go, because their full reasons for 
acting as they do aren't always apparent. The fact that 
some of these adherents embrace the Balance to further 
their personal quests for power makes it impossible to 
count on them as allies with complete certainty.
