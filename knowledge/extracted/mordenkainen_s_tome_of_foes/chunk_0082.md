SHRA'KT'LOR 
Shra'kt'lor is a fortress city that houses the largest 
concentration of githzerai. It serves as both the capital 
of the civilization and the headquarters of the githzerai 
military forces. The greatest generals, spellcasters, and 
zerths of the race meet here to plan or refine their strat-
egy for battling the githyanki and the mind flayers. 
Shra'kt'lor is the most well defended of the githzerai 
outposts- no force in Limbo could readily threaten the 
city or its inhabitants. Teleportation circles are barred 
except on the fringes of the place, at always-guarded 
locations beyond the city's outermost defenses. Those 
who use plane-shifting magic to arrive at these sites or 
who approach through the chaos of Limbo aren't admit-
ted to the city without the approval of an anarch. 
Beyond the entrance to the city wait six layers of 
nested defenses. Each one is dominated by a fortress 
maintained by a powerful anarch chosen by Zaerith 
Menyar-Ag-Gith, who dwells at the heart of it all. 
GITHZERAI IN THE WORLD 
ZERTHIMON DOES NOT EXPECT US TO WAIT IN PATIENCE 
for his return. instead, we must pave the way for his efforts, 
so that we can hasten the coming of our golden age. 
- The Teachings of Menyar-Ag 
It's natural for githzerai to prefer to remain in Limbo. 
They have carved out a well-ordered civilization in 
an environment that they can freely manipulate with 
their minds. When they visit other realms, particularly 
C llAP'T'ER 4 I G ITT! AND TH.£rR END LESS WAR 
the Material Plane, githzerai feel sluggish and aren't 
comfortable functioning in a landscape that they see as 
being locked in immutability. Despite their disinclina-
tion toward travel, the githzerai send groups away from 
Limbo on a regular basis to keep from giving ground in 
their battles against the githyanki and the mind flayers. 
ADAMANTINE CITADELS 
When githzerai travel, they sometimes bring a sliver of 
Limbo along. Before they set out, a cadre of powerful an-
archs craft a citadel of adamantine out of the chaos-stuff 
around them. Inside the structure is more of Limbo's 
essence, left in raw form until it's needed. Then, in an 
eruption of psionic and arcane power that only Men-
yar-Ag can produce, the citadel and its accompanying 
githzerai are transported to another plane. 
After the transfer is complete, at least one anarch 
must always attend the citadel to maintain its form and 
shape as well as to utilize the chaos-stuff within. When 
a citadel is ensconced on another plane, the githzerai 
create a teleportation circle inside it to facilitate travel 
between that plane and Limbo. 
The appearance of an adamantine citadel on another 
plane creates a blot on the natural world. Life, the one 
thing that can't be spontaneously created from the stuff 
of Limbo, is driven away from the location in a wave of 
dread. Depending on the size of the citadel, the affected 
area can have a radius of between several hundred feet 
and several miles. Birds avoid flying over or near it, 
other animals flee the area, and plants in the vicinity 
wither and die. Intelligent creatures can act normally, 
but being in the affected area is unnerving to them, and
