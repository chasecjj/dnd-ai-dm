• A green slime (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) ap-
pears on a spot on the ceiling that j uiblex chooses 
within the lair. The slime disintegrates after 1 hour. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing juiblex's lair is warped by its 
magic, creating one or more of the following effects: 
Small bodies of water, such as ponds or wells, within 
1 mile of the lair turn highly acidic, corroding any ob-
ject that touches them. 
Surfaces within 6 miles of the lair are frequently cov-
ered by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to 
anything that touches it. 
If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile 
of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 
Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness 
determined by the Madness of Juiblex table. A 
creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be 
affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

components:

MADN ESS OF j uIBL_ E_x __ _

Regeneration. )uiblex regains 20 hit points at the start of its 
turn. lfit takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't func-
tion at the start of its next turn. Juiblex dies only if it starts its 
turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate. 
Spider Climb. )uiblex can climb difficult surfaces, including 
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an

A CTIONS 
Multiattack. )uiblex makes three acid lash attacks. 
Acid Lash. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hit: 21 (4d6 + 7) acid damage. Any creature killed by 
this attack is drawn into Juiblex's body, and the corpse is oblit-
erated after l minute. 
Eject Slime (Recharge 5-6). Juiblex spews out a corrosive slime, 
targeting one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. The 
target must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, 
the target takes 55 (lOdlO) acid damage. Unless the target 
avoids taking any of this damage, any metal armor worn by the 
target takes a permanent -1 penalty to the AC it offers, and 
any metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent 
- 1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a 
target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object 
drops to -5, the object is destroyed. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
Juiblex can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options 
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time 
and only at the end of another creature's turn. )uiblex regains
