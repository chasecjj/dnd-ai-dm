CHAPTER 5: 
HALFLINGS AND GNOMES 
REATURES OF MANY RACES AND CULTURES 
are embroiled in struggles that flare up 
across the multiverse. Other folk survive 
in the face of all this turmoil by keeping a 
low profile and avoiding the wars and other 
depredations that keep the outside world in 
a state of flux. 
Halflings and gnomes are two groups that have sur-
vived by remaining largely unnoticed by the aggressive 
powers of the cosmos. Both races are exceptions in a 
multiverse wracked by conflict- peaceful folk who have 
found niches for themselves away from the battles and 
rivalries that fill the lives of the larger folk. 
HALFLINGS 
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FINGERS AND TOES TO COUNT THE 
times I saw our little rogue cheat death, but I remember 
them all. Let's see ... there was the enraged roper, the flam-
ing lava stream, the catapulted gelatinous cubes, the Ten 
Tilting Corridors of Death, the exploding toad trap, the Hall 
of the Spinning Scimitars ... 
-Magnificus, wizard extraordinaire 
Anyone who has spent time around halftings, and par-
ticularly halfling adventurers, has likely witnessed the 
• 
storied "luck of the halflings" in action. When a halfling 
is in mortal danger, it seems as though an unseen force 
intervenes. If a halfling falls off a cliff. her britches will 
snag on a root or a sharp outcrop of rock. If a halfling is 
forced by pirates to walk the plank, he will catch a piece 
of flotsam and use it to stay afloat until he is rescued. 
Halftings believe in the power of luck, and they abide 
by a great number of superstitions that they believe 
bring good or ill fortune. They attribute their unusual 
gift to the favor ofYondalla, believing that, now and 
then, the divine will of the goddess tips the balance of 
fate in their favor (or gives it a hearty shove when the 
occasion warrants). 
NATURALLY INNOCENT 
Scholars, wizards, druids, and bards of other races have 
different ideas about how halftings escape peril, sug-
gesting that by virtue of something in their nature, they 
occupy a special place in the multiverse. 
One such hypothesis cites a legend that speaks of a 
document containing ancient elven writings-a series 
of essays spanning centuries. Among the many arcane 
and mundane topics addressed in this tome, the elves 
set down thoughts regarding the power of innocence. 
They recounted how they had long observed the halfling 
race, watching as the chaos of the world swept around 
them and left their villages untouched. While ores, 
dwarves, and humans struggled, fought, and spilled

blood to expand their territory, the elves noted that the 
halflings dwelled in a state of placid disregard, uncaring 
of the events of the world. They remarked on how the 
halfiings enjoyed the simple pleasures of the moment, 
such as food and music, family, and friendship, and how 
they seemed to desire no more than that. The writers 
concluded that the halflings' seemingly innate ability to 
sidestep turmoil and ill fortune could in fact be a special 
boon of nature, in recognition of the value of protecting 
the halftings' worldview and to ensure that their unique 
place in the cosmos will be forever preserved. 
FRIENDLY TO A FAULT 
Halftings easily warm to creatures of other races that 
don't try to do them harm, in large part due to the lack of 
guile that goes along with their innocent nature. Appear-
ance doesn't matter; what counts is a creature's funda-
mental character, and if the halflings are convinced of a 
creature's good intentions, they respond well. Halflings 
would welcome an ore with a good heart into their com-
pany and treat it as politely they would as an elf visitor. 
This openness doesn't extend all the way to naivete. 
Halflings won't be taken in by merely a promise of good 
intentions, and their instinct for self-preservation makes 
them wary of any new "friend" that doesn't come across 
as genuine. Although they might not be able to define 
the feeling, halflings sense when something isn't quite 
right, keeping their distance from a questionable individ-
ual and advising others to do the same. 
This aspect of the halfling mind-set accounts for what 
members of other races often characterize as courage. 
A halfling about to enter the unknown doesn't feel fear 
as much as wonderment. Instead of being frightened, 
the halfling remains optimistic, confident of having a 
good story to tell when it's all over. Whether the situa-
tion requires a rogue slipping into a dragon's den or the 
HALFLINC SUPERSTITIONS 
Halflings might perform the following actions, among 
many others, to ward off bad luck or to bring good fortune. 
Villages or even families might have superstitions ob-
served by no one else, such as the following: 
• For a safe journey through a forest, leave a few seeds or 
a cloverleaf for Sheela Peryroyl. 
• A large silvery squirrel could be Yondalla in disguise. Be 
on your best behavior and offer a treat when you see her! 
• A spring is a sacred place full of good luck. Take a mo· 
ment to pause and reflect in such a place, or stop for a 
quick snack. 
• Set flowers in your cap or hair to protect against 
evil faeries. 
• When the hair on your neck stiffens or the skin on your 
arm looks like a plucked chicken, know that Charmalaine 
is near-and heed her warning. 
• Put a frog under your cap to bring good luck, but not for 
too long, or it's bad luck for a fortnight. 
• If you step on a butterfly, you'd best not leave the safety 
of your house for three days. 
• When you plant a row of turnips or radishes, be sure to 
bury a nice round stone for Yondalla at the head of it, 
and she'll help bring you some big fellers. 
• Always keep a fairy circle on your left when you pass by, 
and be sure to tip your cap. Never enter or stand in the 
center of one.

HAPPY WITH TODAY 
Throughout recorded history, halftings have never 
sought to expand their reach beyond the borders of their 
isolated communities. They live their lives satisfied with 
what the world has to offer: fresh air, green grass, and 
rich soil. They grow all the food they need, taking plea-
sure in every poached egg and piece of toast. Halflings 
aren't known for great works of literature or elaborate 
written accounts of their history. Scholars who study 
their behavior speculate that halflings realize-con-
sciously or otherwise- that the past is a story that can 
only be retold, not changed, and the future doesn't yet 
exist, so it can't be experienced. Only by living in the mo-
ment can one appreciate the wonder of being alive. 
LIFE AS A HALFLING 
On the surface, halflings seem to be simple folk, but 
those who have lived with them or who have had a half-
ling in their company know that there is much more 
to the lives of these small folk than meets the eye. The 
members of a halfling community have a set of shared 
values and purposes, whether they are tucked away in 
a hillside burrow or occupying a neighborhood of their 
own in a city or town dominated by another race. 
EVERYTHING HAS A STORY 
As do many other races, halflings enjoy accumulating 
personal possessions. But unlike with most other races, 
a halfling's idea of value has little if anything to do with 
monetary concerns. A typical halfling's most prized pos-
sessions are those that have the most interesting stories 
attached to them. Indeed, entering an elderly halfling's 
home is much like opening a book of tales. Every nook 
and cranny contains some quaint curio or another, and 
its owner is more than happy to tell the story of where 
it came from. A halfling who has retired after a life of 
adventuring might own mementos as diverse as a spoon 
from Sigil's Great Bazaar, a pan pilfered from an elven 
kitchen in Evermeet, a rake received as a gift from a 
svirfneblin mushroom tender in the Underdark, and the 
scale of a white dragon acquired from its lair. 
Of course, most halflings' possessions aren't so exotic 
in origin. But even a stay-at-home halfling strives to col-
lect everyday objects that played a significant role in an 
exciting story (such as "the rolling pin that Aunt Hattie 
used to chase away a bugbear" or "the shoes that Tim-
tom wore when he escaped from the wolf"). Halflings 
believe that an item has a "spirit" of its own- the more 
dramatic or incredible its story, the stronger its spirit. 
This outlook prompts them to ask probing questions 
about the possessions of other folk they encounter- que-
ries that can make them seem nosy to those who don't 
understand where they're coming from.
