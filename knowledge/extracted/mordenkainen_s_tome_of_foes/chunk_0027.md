CHAPTER 2: 
ELVES 
HE MOST ANCIENT TALES SPEAK OF ELVES 
as the children of the god Corellon. Unlike 
many similar myths involving other races, 
these tales are true. Elves are all descended 
from a deity, and their origin Jed to a trag-
edy that shapes their culture to this day. 
The gulf between the elves and Corellon, 
and the split between Corellon and Lolth, arose from 
the same transgression. That one incident set all the 
many races of elves on their present paths, determined 
their unique life cycle, and triggered an unflagging 
hatred between the drow and the elves of the Material 
Plane. No other event has had such momentous impact 
on elven history as the one that began it all. 
A R ACE DIVIDED 
O NCE WE FOLLOWED IN CORELLON'S FOOTSTEPS, BUT 
we strayed from that path. For our whole existence, we pay 
penance for a misstep. It is just? Mayhap not, but when is 
love just? Is loss and longing a matterforjudges to decide? 
The heart knows what the soul wants. 
- Amlaruil Moonflower, Last Queen of Evermeet 
Long before elves existed, Corellon danced from world 
to world and plane to plane. A being of consummate 
mutability and infinite grace, Corellon was a god like 
no other- able to take the form of a chuckling stream, 
a teasing breeze, an incandescent beam, a cavorting 
fiame, or a crackling bolt of lightning. On nothing more 
than a whim, Corellon's body could become a school of 
fish, a swarm of bees, or a flock of birds. When consort-
ing with other gods, Corellon often adopted their ap-
pearances- male, female, or something else- but just as 
often kept their company in the form of a rose blossom 
or a delicate doe. 
Corellon's flamboyant, mercurial personality showed 
through no matter which form the entity took. Corellon 
loved wholeheartedly, broke oaths without reservation, 
and took pleasure from every encounter with the other 
divine beings of the multiverse. 
Most of the gods accepted Corellon's mutability 
and passionate behavior, but these traits infuriated 
Gruumsh, the greatest of the ore gods. Gruumsh's 
wrath was almost universally respected, even among 
the divine powers, but Corellon blithely took no heed of 
him. Perhaps it was this seeming hauteur that enabled 
Gruumsh to get close enough to wound Corellon, ignit-
ing the legendary conflict that cost Gruumsh one of his 
eyes. Depending on who does the telling, the battle was 
a clash of titans fought across many planes and worlds, 
or it was little more than an annoyance to Corellon. But 
the legends all agree that the first elves emerged from 
the blood that Corellon shed.
