CHAPTER 3: 
DWARVES AND DUERGAR 
0 IMPARTIAL OBSERVERS, THE TALE OF THE 
ancient war between dwarves and duergar 
is at its heart a tragedy, the story of a people 
turned against each other by bitterness and 
resentment. Once the dwarves were unified 
in their worship of Moradin, the deity who 
crafted the first dwarves from metal and 
fire. Today, the race is splintered into those who still 
embrace him as their father and creator- and those who 
have sworn to topple him from his divine throne. 
While the dwarves loyal to Morad in take joy in the art 
of crafting and form strong family bonds, the duergar 
are joyless, hateful creatures who create their works out 
of an urge to build and acquire. They come closest to 
feeling true joy when they raid dwarven strongholds to 
satisfy their lust for blood and treasure.

The conflict began in ages past, when the world was 
new. Almost all the dwarves were more than content to 
make their homes inside the mountains and hills that 
were filled with ore and other valuables, not digging too 
far beneath the surface. The dwarves of clan Duergar, 
however, became obsessed with delving deep into the 
Underdark. The clan's miners continually insisted that 
a great trove of gold and iron lay just beyond where the 
clan had explored. The next strike of a pick, they said, 
could reveal wealth beyond imagining. 
This obsession took root and spread throughout the 
clan. Soon, all other activity in the community ceased; 
the forges grew cold, and the temples to Moradin stood 
empty. Every dwarf old enough to hold a pick or shovel 
worked the mines. 
The dwarves relentlessly dug, hacked, and tunneled. 
The weakest among them fell dead from exhaustion, the 
rest pausing only long enough to push the corpses aside 
so they could continue the digging. 
Only the hardiest and most iron-willed individuals 
of the clan survived this brutal campaign. When their 
delving finally broke through into a cavern, the dwarves 
found the cause of their obsession. A great elder brain 
and its mind flayers waited there, ready to take the next 
step in the subjugation of clan Duergar. The monsters 
had sent out a psychic lure that played on the dwarves' 
greed, and the never-ending work schedule that was 
the product of their obsession weeded out all but the 
best specimens for their slave pens. The illithids had no 
trouble overwhelming the remaining dwarves with their 
psionic power and soon put them to work.

The dwarves proved to be able s laves, but the elder 
brain saw within them another kind of usefulness. The 
dwarves' innate ability to resist the effects of harmful 
substances such as poison made them suitable subjects 
for a variety of grisly experiments. Generations of psy-
chic surgery and physical alterations mutated the cap-
tives into creatures that had special powers of their own. 
In time, a leader arose among the enslaved dwarves. 
Named Laduguer, he struck a deal with Asmodeus, 
pledging the assistance of clan Duergar against Lolth's 
ambitions in the Underdark. With the help of the Lord of 
the Nine, the dwarves overthrew their illithid masters in 
a great uprising. At last, Laduguer could bring his clan 
upward to rejoin the world they had left behind. 
TRIUMPH TuRNED SOUR 
When Laduguer and his people returned to the dwarves 
of the upper world, they were shocked by the hostility 
they faced. As Laduguer quickly learned, the priests of 
Moradin had long ago labeled the lost clan as heretics, 
spoken of now only as an object lesson concerning the 
fate of dwarves who stray from Moradin's teachings. 
When Laduguer protested this treatment, the priests 
insisted that Moradin had sent omens and warnings to 
the lost dwarves, but they went unheeded. Envoys from 
the other clans had found clan Duergar's stronghold 
abandoned, with no evidence of invasion, plague, or 
other calamity. Even worse, the temples of Moradin had 
been left untended. Only laziness, greed, and contempt 
for the All-Father could account for the clan's fate. 
CHAPTER 3 I DWARVES AND DUERCAR 
Laduguer, in response, tried to explain that his people 
had been lured into a trap by the mind flayers, but his 
assertions fell on deaf ears. Thus, with no other ap-
parent choice, the lost clan fled back to the Underdark. 
Laduguer focused his fury on Moradin. The dwarves' 
supposed father had turned a blind eye as they fell into 
the mind flayers' trap, then sat idle as the clan suffered 
unspeakable abuses. Laduguer and his followers swore 
that they wouldn't rest until the father of the dwarves lay 
dead and Laduguer sat upon his throne. 
Of course, by declaring his intent to destroy Moradin, 
Laduguer created a state of war between the duergar 
and the other dwarves in the world. Since that time, 
the duergar have not eased up on their hostility, and the 
dwarves have not relaxed their vigilance. 
CONFLICT WITHOUT END 
Few others aside from the dwarves and the duergar 
understand or appreciate the true scope and intensity of 
the battles between these two races. Viewed on a grand 
scale, the conflict is a great war of attrition- the com-
batants don't often gain or lose territory as the result of 
battle. But on a personal scale, combat is brutal, with no 
quarter given or expected. 
The duergar fight a persistent guerrilla war of sud-
den raids and brutal attacks against isolated groups of 
dwarves. Duergar often begin an attack by burrowing 
into a dwarf settlement from below, then bursting out 
in a vicious assault that leaves few survivors. If robbery 
rather than murder is the goal, a duergar war party
