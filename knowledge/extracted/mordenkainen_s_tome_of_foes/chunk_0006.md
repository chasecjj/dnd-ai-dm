LORDS OF THE N INE 
From his throne at the bottom of the Nine Hells, As-
modeus commands a sprawling bureaucracy tied to a 
massive war apparatus dedicated to turning back the 
demons that invade the uppermost realm of Avernus, 
and to taking the fight to the other planes, including the 
Abyss, whenever the opportunity arises. 
Asmodeus and the other archdevils rule over the nine 
layers that comprise the Hells. The devil lords make 
up a hierarchy that is both rigid and fragile. Although 
Asmodeus is more powerful than any other lord, he has 
to be constantly wary of treachery within his ranks. It 
could be said that the true ruler of the Nine Hells is the 
immense body of rules and regulations that dictate how 
all devils, even Asmodeus, must conduct themselves.

ASMODEUS 
I LITERALLY SIT BENEATH EIGHT TIERS OF SCHEMING, 
ambitious entities that represent primal law suffused with 
evil. The path from this realm leads to an infinite pit of 
chaos and evil. Now, tell me again how you andyour ilk are 
the victims in this eternal struggle. 
- Asmodeus addresses the celestial jury, 
from The Trial of Asmodeus 
Asmodcus is an unmatched strategist and orator. The 
most epic of all his achievements is chronicled in The 
Trial of Asmodeus, a play based on purportedly true 
events as researched by the aasimar bard Anodius. 
In ancient times, as the Blood War raged, the angels 
of law and good that dwell on Mount Celestia issued a 
decree accusing Asmodeus of terrible crimes. Outraged 
by such claims, the Lord of the Nine Hells petitioned 
for the right to answer the charges before his accus-
ers. The angels, although shocked at his impudence, 
accepted his petition and agreed to hear the bargain he 
proposed. Both sides, he suggested, would present their 
case to Primus, leader of the modrons. As a creature of 
absolute law, Primus could be trusted to issue a fair and 
impartial verdict. Asmodeus drafted a contract to seal 
the deal, and the angels- after carefully scrutinizing the 
terms-agreed to the trial.

When he testified before Primus, Asmodeus attributed 
his actions to the dictates of law and the survival of the 
cosmos. He admitted that he swayed mortals to evil, but 
he and his minions never breached a contract and ex-
plained the terms clearly. Had they not obeyed the rule 
of law in doing so? Was it not mortal ambition, rather 
than infernal deception, that led so many souls astray? 
Asmodeus also pointed out that the souls harvested 
from the Material Plane went on to serve in the infernal 
legions that repel the endless tide of the Abyss. Were not 
such souls put to good use against the demonic hordes, 
a power that if unchecked would scour the universe of 
all lawfulness and goodness? 
He further asserted that he was bound to the rules 
and traditions of the Nine Hells, compelled to adhere to 
law and to maintain the devils' trafficking in souls. If he 
violated those laws, he would be no better than the de-
mons he fought. Mortals who refused a devil's offer were 
left alone, in accordance with the law. Those who struck 
deals with his followers and then somehow turned the 
contracts against the devils were freed from their debts. 
A contract is the law, and the law is a contract. 
Primus weighed Asmodeus's words and listened pa-
tiently as angel after angel testified to his crimes. Hours 
turned to days and days into weeks as more and more of 
his sins entered the court record. 
Even Primus's patience has its limits, and in time, the 
remaining angels who were eager to testify were told 
that only a few more would be allowed to speak. A brawl 
broke out when one angel, Zariel, pushed her way to the 
front and demanded to be heard. As the scuffle turned 
into a battle, Asmodeus looked on with a smirk. 
In the end, Primus declined to issue a definitive 
judgment. He rebuked the angels for their descent into 
infighting, but didn't punish Asmodeus for his evil ways. 
He did, however, order Asmodcus to forever carry a 
mighty artifact, the Ruby Rod, that would guarantee his 
adherence to law. The artifact, which has remained at 
Asmodeus's side ever since, grants him and his under-
lings the right to enter into contracts with mortals for 
their souls but unleashes an inescapable punishment 
upon any devil that breaches such a contract. 
HE WHO WOULD RULE 
Asmodeus wants to rule the cosmos. Under his watch, 
he believes, the universe would take on a pristine, per-
fect state, with every living creature assigned a place in 
the infernal hierarchy. Wars would end, and every crea-
ture would have a purpose to fulfill. The universe would 
be a utopia, at least as Asmodeus views such a thing. 
Of course, as he sees it, Asmodeus is the only being 
with the charisma, strength, and insight necessary to 
shepherd in this ideal future. His rivals are inferiors 
who, if left to their own devices, will turn the cosmos 
into a demon-infested maelstrom. The powers of good 
are sentimental fools, too delicate and soft to do what 
must be done. In his mind, Asmodeus has been chosen 
by the universe to protect it from annihilation. 
If Asmodeus were any less capable, his arrogance 
would have led to his undoing long ago. Yet still he 
sits atop his throne, having thwarted every conspiracy 
mounted against him. He once walked into the lair of 
one of his enemies in Mount Celestia and survived us-
CHAPTER l J THE BLOOD WAR 
ing nothing more than his words and his wits. Even his 
most ardent enemies must grudgingly admit that his 
skill and competence are unparalleled. 
POWER WITHOUT LIMIT 
Unlike the other Lords of the Nine, Asmodeus has no 
quota of souls to fill. Any soul recruited by any denizen 
of the Nine Hells is also pledged in his name, and a cult 
dedicated to any other devil is also dedicated to him. 
Because he doesn't need to spend his time courting 
mortals, he concentrates on manipulating demigods and 
beings of similar station. Occasionally, he lures such a 
being into a contract and adds a new, unique devil to the 
ranks of the Hells. His most recent recruit is Zariel, a 
former angel. His supposed daughter, Glasya, is thought 
by some sages to be a godlike entity of unknown origin. 
LORD OF NESSUS 
Asmodeus resides in Nessus, the bottommost layer of 
the Nine Hells. By design, the place is devoid of activity, 
since Asmodeus values his privacy and safety. The en-
vironment is a rocky wasteland, crisscrossed by deep 
fissures and lacking roads, bridges, and other means 
of passage. Asmodeus dwells in a great fortress some-
where in the wasteland, at the bottom of its deepest pit. 
Only his most trusted followers and most important ad-
visors know the route to it. He remains inside, relying on 
messengers and magic to convey his dictates. 
ZARI EL 
KEEP WASTING MY TIME WITH YOUR POINTLESS WORDS 
and die, or join my war band and live. Choose swiftly. I 
have a plane to conquer. 
- Zariel addressing emissaries from Dis 
Zariel was once an angel, but her impetuous nature 
and love of battle led to her fall. In her previous life, she 
was charged with observing the battles on Avernus and 
tracking their progress. From this exposure, she grew 
obsessed with the Blood War, and a thirst for battle 
grew within her that she couldn't ignore. In time, she 
became frustrated that she and the other angels were 
forced to remain spectators while the demons and devils 
battled. The hosts of Mount Celestia, she believed, could 
descend upon Avernus en masse and wipe both hordes 
of evil from the cosmos if they so desired. 
After her repeated requests to join the fray were de-
nied, her frustration overtook her, and she launched her-
self into the Blood War. Accompanied by a mob of mor-
tal followers, she cut a swath through a legion of devils 
before their numbers overwhelmed her. A delegation 
of bone devils later dispatched to the site by Asmodeus 
recovered her unconscious form beneath a small moun-
tain of her slaughtered enemies. After allowing her to 
recover in the depths of Nessus, Asmodeus installed her 
on Avernus as his champion and new lord of that layer. 
A FIGHTING GENERAL 
When Zariel supplanted the pit fiend Bel as the ruler of 
Avernus, that change signaled a major shift in the devils' 
tactics. Zariel's fiery temperament and reckless maneu-
