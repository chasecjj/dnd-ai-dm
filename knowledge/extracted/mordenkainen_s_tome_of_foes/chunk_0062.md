dwarves) tend to be suspicious, taciturn, and secretive, 
and especially distrustful of anyone who doesn't show 
outward signs of wealth. 
Shield Dwarves. The ambition to seek new horizons 
that led the first dwarves to leave Bhaerynden still runs 
strong in shield dwarves today. Over thousands of years, 
many kingdoms of shield dwarves have risen, often at 
the whim of one enterprising individual who decided to 
found a new clan. So too have many kingdoms of shield 
dwarves fallen and been forgotten, leaving behind won-
drous landmarks and mysterious dungeons. 
S hield dwarves who occupy a stronghold can be 
as clannish and insular as gold dwarves, but shield 
dwarves are far more likely than gold dwarves to dwell 
in surface communities. forming trade relationships and 
alliances with neighboring nations. The openness of the 
shield dwarves as a people manifests on a personal level 
as well, with individuals being far more likely to travel 
among and make friends with other races. 
DWARVES OF DRAGONLANCE 
Most dwarves on the world of Krynn trace their ances-
try to a single great empire known as Kal-Thax. They 
have long been split into several clans based on tradi-
tional roles that were established in Kal-Thax and its 
successor settlements. Yet, as with much on Krynn, the 
fate of the dwarves has been shaped by the Cataclysm. 
Before the Cataclysm, the dwarves that dwelt on the 
surface, called the Neidar, interacted with other races 
and provided foodstuffs and goods for their subterra-
nean cousins that couldn't be acquired underground. 
The great city ofThorbardin was the most prominent of 
the dwarves' underground settlements, where several 
clans lived and worked together. 
But when the anger of the gods struck the world, 
mountains fell and seas rose. Although many settle-
ments of dwarves were wiped out, Thorbardin survived. 
When the famine and plagues caused by the Cataclysm 
swept the world, the Neidar and their human allies 
sought succor from Thorbardin, which the Neidar knew 
held stores of food that could last generations. But the 
king wouldn't let any citizen ofThorbardin suffer to ease 
the anguish of the supplicants at its gates. 
The result of that refusal was the Dwarfgate Wars, a 
series of sieges and battles that ended when a magical 
explosion and conflagration consumed both armies on 
the battlefield. Thorbardin's gates remained shut, and 
the hatred between the Neidar and the other clans has 
festered for centuries. Although some families among 
the Neidar eventually founded new communities, many 
of the surface dwellers drifted apart to take up life with 
humans or as lone traders and crafters. 
Meanwhile, within Thorbardin, disagreements over 
the treatment of the Neidar, the loss of Thorbardin's 
army in the war, the distribution of supplies, and other 
disputes drove the clans farther apart. The Hylar are 
Thorbardin's best engineers and crafters, and that clan 
continues to rule despite its increasingly autocratic poli-
cies. Although the subservient clans continue to perform 
their traditional roles in the hierarchy, they have largely 
segregated themselves into separate districts within 
Thorbardin. The ambitious and vicious Theiwar clan 
C ll AJYl l::R 3 I O WARV1'.S AND DUERGAR 
maintains its influence through the use of mysterious 
magic. The Daergar grudgingly work as Thorbardin's 
miners when they aren't taking out their aggression on 
each other or antagonizing other clans. The Daewar 
long ago submitted to the rule of the Hylar and have the 
privilege of being Thorbardin's merchants and builders. 
Driven mad by their love of quicksilver, the wild Klar 
serve as Thorbardin's scouts and fiercest warriors. 
Gully Dwarves. The Aghar clan is an anomaly among 
the dwarves of Krynn, having retained a foothold both in 
out-the-way locations inside Thorbardin and on the sur-
face. Referred to by others as gully dwarves, the Aghar 
are derided as stupid, s melly, and dirty. Most dwarves 
consider them a form of vermin, unsuitable even as ser-
vants. The Aghar in Thorbardin have carved out living 
space for themselves from the massive piles of tailings 
left over from the excavations of the Daergar. They have 
no role in sustaining the city. 
DWARVEN RELIGION 
OUR FOREl)EARS INSTILL WITHIN US THE POTENTIAL FOR 
everything that made them great. It is our responsibility to 
refine that gift into something wonderful. 
-Vistra Frostbeard 
The religion of the dwarves is at the root of the societal 
roles that dwarves follow. Where most other creatures 
view their deities as ultrapowerful beings who stand 
forever apart from their worshipers, the dwarves see 
their gods as exemplars who blaze a path for their lives 
to follow. Dwarven deities exist in a wide variety, with a 
few common across many worlds. They are collectively 
known as the Mordinsamman. 
Morad in is foremost among the dwarven pantheon, 
the epitome of everything dwarves strive to be. The rest 
of the group consists of those first dwarves who per-
formed their labors so well that they could almost dupli-
cate Moradin's level of skill. 
The Dwarf Deities table lists the members of the Mor-
dinsamman. For each god, the table notes alignment, 
province (the god's main areas of interest and responsi-
bility), suggested domains for clerics who serve the god, 
and a common symbol of the god. Several of the gods in 
the table are described below. 
MO RADIN 
The father of the dwarves crafted his children from 
metal and gems and imbued them with souls as he 
cooled them with his breath. 
Morad in is the master of every craft practiced by the 
dwarves and the patron of artisans. He expects his chil-
dren to follow in his footsteps, studying his techniques 
and aspiring to one day match his expertise. 
Priests of Morad in are responsible for judging and 
assessing the work of a stronghold's artisans. They keep 
great volumes that describe various crafting techniques 
in detail, and use the guidelines in them to judge the 
quality of individual works. 
The priests also evaluate young dwarves to determine 
the youths' vocations. The decisions of the priests are 
accepted without question.
