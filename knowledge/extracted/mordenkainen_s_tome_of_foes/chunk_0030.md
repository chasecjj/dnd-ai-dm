H ALF- ELF, H ALF SOUL? 
From the elven perspective, the birth of a half-elf rep-
resents a disruption of the natural order of reincarnation. 
Elves in different communities and across different worlds 
have numerous ideas about the nature of the disruption, 
because the gods have never given an answer that seems 
applicable to all. The soul of a half-elf might be an elf soul 
whose connection to the Seldarine has been weakened, or 
it might be a true elf soul trapped in the body of a half-elf 
until death, or the soul that lies beneath one's elf-like vis-
age might be human. 
Many elves, especially the younger ones, view the ex-
istence of half-elves as a sign of hope rather than as a 
threat- an example of how elf souls can experience the 
world in new ways, not bound to a single physical form or 
a particular philosophy. 
that can be fulfilled only if they are raised together. Elf 
legends are filled with tales of misfortune and tragedy 
that comes to pass when twins are separated and kept 
too long apart. One might be compelled to reunite with 
the other, at risk of life and limb; identical twins could 
become entangled in a case of mistaken identity; or the 
siblings might grow up as opposites, each determined to 
seek out and defeat the other. 
During a young elf's first few years, the memories 
evoked during trance are drawn not from current life ex-
periences, but from the fantastic past adventures of the 
elf's immortal soul. Parents of young elves and priests 
of Erevan Ilesere encourage the youths to explore these 
memories and talk about them with one another, but 
they aren't to be discussed with adults until a memory of 
waking life first intrudes upon a youngster's trance. This 
experience, called the First Reflection, marks the end of 
childhood and the start of adolescence. 
ADOLESCENCE 
Most elves experience their First Reflection in their sec-
ond or third decade. It marks the beginning of the pe-
riod when an elf must focus on acquiring the knowledge 
and skills needed for the elf's role as an adult. 
As a means to this end, elves in adolescence learn 
how to use trance to evoke memories of their waking 
lives, giving them opportunities to reflect on the joys of 
the mortal world and to reinforce the principles of any 
training or practice undertaken while awake. At the 
same time, the memories of long ago that came so easily 
during childhood now arise less and less frequently. The 
Drawing of the Veil is the name that elves give to the 
occasion when a young elf no longer experiences primal 
memories during trance but instead recalls only the 
events of its current mortal existence.

ADULTHOOD 
The Drawing of the Veil marks an elf's passage into 
adulthood, which typically occurs at the end of the first 
century of life. 
Losing access to one's primal memories can be a 
traumatic experience. Elder elves look for signs of this 
change in young elves and try to guide them through it. 
Most elven cultures mark the Drawing of the Veil with a 
ceremony of pride or celebration, as a way of offsetting 
an individual's melancholy. For some young adults, this 
might be a time to contemplate Labelas Enoreth, while 
in another community the Drawing of the Veil is occa-
sion for a celebration that invokes gods such as Alobal 
Lorfiril and Zandilar. 
After the Drawing of the Veil, an elf enters the prime 
of life, a span of centuries during which most elves 
strive to engage with the world. An adult elf learns how 
to control the memories that bubble up during trance, 
choosing to recall experiences from its waking life that 
enhance its training or give it solace in bad times. 
This is the stage of elven life that others are most 
familiar with because it's the age when elves move out-
side their reclusive communities and interact with the 
larger world. They strive to have a permanent effect on 
the world, to change things for the better (as they see it). 
Elves want to leave a mark on the world that future gen-
erations will remember. 
Over time, an adult elf can become accomplished 
in many endeavors while pursuing its destiny. It isn't 
unusual among elves to meet someone who is expert in 
disparate disciplines, such as a battle wizard who also 
is a settlement's best vintner and famous for creating 
delicate wood carvings. This versatility speaks to every 
adult elf's eagerness for new experiences, because mem-
ories of adventures, escapades, and accomplishments 
will fuel the next and possibly longest phase of one's life. 
ELDER ELVES 
At some point during adulthood, the reverie of an elf's 
trance is first interrupted by a new form of unbidden 
thought. This seemingly errant memory arises not from 
the elf's personal experience, nor from the memories 
of the elf's primal soul, but comes from another life 
and another time. An elf's first experience of this sort 
is often referred to as the Remembrance and attributed 
to the influence of Labelas Enoreth. Or it is called the 
Revelation, and Araleth Letheranil is honored for its 
occurrence. Regardless of its label, this event marks the 
start of a new phase in an elf's life. 
DREAMS FROM BEYOND MEMORY 
Elves can sleep and dream just like any human, but almost 
all surface elves avoid doing so. Dreams, as humans know 
them, are strange and confusing to elves. Unlike the actual 
memories of one's primal soul, present life, or past lives, 
dreams are uncontrolled products of the subconscious, 
and perhaps the subconscious minds of those past lives 
or primal souls as well. An elf who dreams must always 
wonder whose mind these thoughts first arose from, and 
why. Priests of Sehanine Moon bow are an exception: they 
sleep and dream to receive signs from their god, and elves 
consult such priests to interpret their own dreams.
