Prince of Demons, the Sibilant Beast, and Master of the 
Spiraling Depths, Demogorgon is the embodiment of 
chaos, madness, and destruction, seeking to corrupt all 
that is good and undermine order in the multiverse, to 
see everything dragged howling into the infinite depths 
of the Abyss. 
The demon lord is a meld of different forms, with a 
saurian lower body and clawed, webbed feet, as well as 
suckered tentacles sprouting from the shoulders of a 
great apelike torso, surmounted by two hideous simian 
heads, named Aameul and Hathradiah, both equally 
mad. Their gaze brings madness and confusion to any 
who confront it.

CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
• 
Similarly, the spiraling Y sign of Demogorgon's cult 
can inspire madness in those who contemplate it for too 
long. All the followers of the Prince of Demons go mad, 
sooner or later. 
Demogorgon makes his lair in a palace called Abysm, 
found on a layer of the Abyss known as the Gaping Maw. 
Demogorgon's lair is a place of madness and duality; 
the portion of the palace that lies above water takes 
the form of two serpentine towers, each crowned by 
a skull.shaped minaret. There, Demogorgon's heads 
contemplate the mysteries of the arcane while arguing 
about how best to obliterate their rivals. The bulk of 
this palace extends deep underwater, in chill and dark-
ened caverns. 
Tentacle. Me/ee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hit: 28 (3dl2 + 9) bludgeoning damage. If the target 
is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constit~tion saving 
throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal 
to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target fin-
ishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is 
reduced to 0. 
Gaze. Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature 
that he can see within 120 feet of him. That target must make 
a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the target is incapac-
itated, it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automat-
ically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see 
Demogorgon until the start of his next turn. If the target looks 
at him in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. 
If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the follow-
ing effects of Demogorgon's choice or at random: 
1. Beguiling Gaze. The target is stunned until the start of 
Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer 
within line of sight. 
2. Hypnotic Gaze. The target is charmed by Demogorgon until 
the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses 
how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and 
movement. Because this gaze requires Demogorgon to focus 
both heads on the target, he can't use his Maddening Gaze 
legendary action until the start of his next turn. 
3. Insanity Gaze. The target suffers the effect of the confusion 
spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the 
start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need 
to concentrate on the spell. 
LEG ENDARY A CTIONS 
Demogorgon can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from 
the options below. Only one legendary action option can be 
used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. 
Demogorgon regains spent legendary actions at the start 
of his turn. 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. 
Hit: 20 (2dl0 + 9) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2dl0) ne-
crotic damage. 
Maddening Gaze. Demogorgon uses his Gaze action, and must 
choose either the Beguiling Gaze or the Insanity Gaze effect.
