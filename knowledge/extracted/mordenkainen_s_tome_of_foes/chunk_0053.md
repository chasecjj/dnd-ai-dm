their trust in these cryptic, cawing guides to lead them 
to where the barriers are weakest so they can then slip 
across planes to their destination. Once at their destina-
tion, the shadar-kai watch and wait, looking for the trag-
edies their queen wishes them to collect. Sometimes 
they are small: a spurned lover, a lost item, a betrayal. 
But some tragedies are much graver: a murder, a war, 
a diabolical bargain. To bring back a trinket for their 
queen, the shadar-kai use their shadow magic. If a tar-
get is living, they magically infiltrate the person's mind 
and excise the desired bits of emotion, or if the target is 
close to death, the shadar-kai capture the whole soul to 
bring back to the Raven Queen. 
Sediment of Memory. Shadar-kai are very interested 
in the magical silt at the bottom of the River Styx that 
holds the memories and identities of lost souls. Any 
adventurers who travel to the Nine Hells to procure a 
vial of this powder will likely draw the attention of the 
shadar-kai, who will attempt to steal or barter for it. 
Adventurers might also bring a bit of the sediment as a 
gift to the Raven Queen. What she would give in return 
is never known ahead of time, but her boons come in 
many wondrous forms: the restoration of a lost soul, the 
rediscovery of a missing memory, or a glimpse into the 
forgotten knowledge of the ancients.

ELADRIN 
Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of 
beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. 
An eladrin is associated witb one of the four seasons 
and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which 
can also affect the eladrin's mood: 
Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when 
summer's harvest is shared with all. 
Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when 
the vibrant energy of the world slumbers. 
Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, 
marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes. 
Summer is the season of boldness and aggression. a 
time of unfettered energy. 
Some eladrin remain associated with a particular 
season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin 
transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. 
When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change 
their season. An eladrin might choose the season that 
is present in the world or perhaps the season that most 
closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. 
For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled 
with contentment, another eladrin could change to win-
ter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be burst-
ing with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury 
might cause an eladrin to change to summer. 
The following tables offer personality suggestions for 
eladrin of each season. You can roll on the tables or use 
them as inspiration for characteristics of your own.
