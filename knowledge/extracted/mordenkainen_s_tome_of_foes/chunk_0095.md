On the world of Krynn in the Dragonlance setting, rock 
gnomes take invention to extreme heights and are known 
for being purveyors of madcap mayhem. Despite losing 
body parts or gaining scars from various accidents, noth-
ing stops the tinker gnomes' insatiable quest to experi-
ment and discover. 
Go Big or Co Home. The creations of tinker gnomes 
range from the ridiculous to the dangerous. They love to 
push the art of invention beyond its limits, and to explore 
the instability of volatile materials. They cackle with glee 
after an ear-splitting bang, and jump and cavort amid 
lethal sprays of lightning. Though it might be bizarre and 
unusual, a working tinker gnome creation is a rare thing, 
and highly prized. Such inventions include the following: 
• A chain-driven tomato smasher that is also able to fly 
• A lightning-powered portable rat-zapper-
good for keep-
ing out the vermin 
• A floating metal facsimile of a beholder, complete with 
disintegrating eye rays 
• A flock of exploding parrots 
Fail Often, Fail Happy. These inventors are delighted 
by every explosion, every melted mess, and every heap of 
smoking wreckage. Failure is part of the eventual solution 
and something to be celebrated. A truly epic failure might 
be cause for a great celebration in the community. 
perimentation and discovery. Even though rock gnomes 
appreciate the practical aspects of their endeavors, 
they also find satisfaction in creating items that have no 
true usefulness. Many an invention is celebrated just 
for being beautiful to behold or for being complex and 
intricate in its construction, and the artists who create 
such things are as esteemed as those who specialize in 
designing tools. 
Exploration is a part of invention, as the gnomes see 
it, so there's nothing wrong with creating machines and

artifacts that seem to have no purpose. The gnomes who 
produce these works of art are using new ideas and new 
approaches, breaking through old boundaries and ad-
vancing the frontier of knowledge. For instance, an art-
ist might create a beautiful articulated sculpture whose 
pieces can be manipulated in a unique way. Another 
artisan might take that idea and apply it to a new form of 
invention- but no one forgets that it was the artist's idea 
that blazed the trail for that journey. 
ALCHEMISTS 
Rock gnome alchemists explore the nature of minerals 
and chemicals, curious to see what happens when they 
mix certain substances with other compounds or with 
raw magic. Most alchemists, even those who busy them-
selves with experimentation and new ideas, can produce 
a number of useful substances, such as alchemist's fire, 
antitoxin, super slippery goo, stone melting compound, 
stirge repellent, and glow-in-the-dark paint. 
A RTIFICERS 
Rock gnome artificers construct exquisitely tooled and 
enameled pieces of machinery, often weaving magical 
properties into their work. Artificers often develop a rep-
utation for a particular style and type of work. For exam-
ple, a friendly gnome artificer might create lovable me-
chanical pets and companions, while a grumpy gnome 
might make snapping critter constructs with sharp teeth 
and claws. Gnome artificers can become famous, with 
their works highly sought after by nobles, wizards, and 
other collectors. 
An artificer's inventions might include items such as a 
lock box that opens with a verbal command or a series 
of gestures, a clockwork critter designed to respond to 
simple commands, or a common magic item (such as 
those introduced in Xanathar's Guide to Everything). 
TUNNEL VISION 
When they are at work, rock gnomes hole up in their 
workshops with "Do Not Disturb" signs hung on the 
door. It isn't uncommon for gnomes who are working on 
their projects to spend most of their time in seclusion, 
and even when they emerge (for meals or other reasons), 
they are often deep in thought and oblivious of their 
surroundings. In the safety of the burrow, they seldom 
come to harm because of this vulnerability. But even 
city-dwelling gnomes can fall prey to this sort of obses-
sion as they pursue their projects, and in such cases 
it's much safer for them to stay in their homes, since a 
gnome wandering the streets deep in thought is liable to 
walk into a moat or be run over by a wagon. 
FOREST GNOMES 
As the companions of nature and its animals, forest 
gnomes learn from their surroundings as if from a mas-
ter teacher. They evade incursions into their wooded 
realm by great numbers of humans and other races, but 
they aid individuals and small groups whom they deem 
worthy of their help. They create lovely gardens, organic 
sculptures, and wondrous emerald jewelry- that pre-
cious green stone being their favorite of all gems.
