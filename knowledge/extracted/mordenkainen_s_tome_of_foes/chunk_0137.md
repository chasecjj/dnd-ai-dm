AMNIZU 
Amnizus lead the infernal legions into battle and com-
mand guardians at the gateways to the Hells. Amnizus 
are arrogant, bullying, and ruthless, but they're also 
highly intelligent tacticians and unfailingly loyal- quali-
ties that the hellish archdukes value. 
Guarding the River S tyx. Some amnizus perform 
the critical task of watching over the River S tyx from 
fortresses along the river's blighted banks, where it 
flows through Dis and Stygia. Souls arriving in the form 
of lemures have no personalities or memories; they're 
driven only by the desire to commit evil. The amnizus 
that patrol here drill the rules of the Nine Hells into the 
new arrivals' pitiful brains and marshal the lemures 
into legions. 
VARIANT: D EVIL SUM MONIN G 
Some amnizus have an action that allows them to sum-
mon other devils. 
Summon Devil (1/Day). The amnizu summons 2d4 
bearded devils or ld4 barbed devils. A summoned devil 
appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the 
amnizu, acts as an ally of the amnizu, and can't summon 
other devils. It remains for l minute, until the amnizu 
dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

CHAPTER 6 I Ol::STTARY

ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The amnizu uses Poison Mind. It also makes two 
attacks: one with its whip and one with its Disruptive Touch. 
Taskmaster Whip. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., 
one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 33 (6dl0) 
force damage. 
Disruptive Touch. Melee Spell Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 44 (8dl0) necrotic damage. 
Poison Mind. The amnizu targets one or two creatures that it 
can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 
19 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4dl2) necrotic damage and 
be blinded until the start of the amnizu's next turn . 
Forgetfulness (Recharge 6). The amnizu targets one creature 
it can see within 60 feet of it. That creature must succeed on 
a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or become stunned for l 
minute. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end 
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If 
the target is stunned for the full minute, it forgets everything it 
sensed, experienced, and learned during the last 5 hours. 
REACTIONS 
Instinctive Charm. When a creature within 60 feet of the am-
nizu makes an attack roll against it, and another creature is 
within the attack's range, the attacker must make a DC 19 
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker must 
target the creature that is closest to it, not including the am-
nizu or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker 
chooses which one to target. If the saving throw is successful, 
the attacker is immune to the amnizu's Instinctive Charm 
for 24 hours.
