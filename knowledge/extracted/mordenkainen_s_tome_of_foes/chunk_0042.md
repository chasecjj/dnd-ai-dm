FOMORIAN S 
The hideous fomorians were once the most handsome of 
the giants. They lived in the Feywild alongside the elves, 
and the two societies were allies because of their mutual 
love for magic. But then the fomorians twisted their love 
into malice and turned magic into a slave that toiled 
for them to feed their lust for power. When they tried to 
conquer the Feywild and enslave the elves, too, the elves 
united with other fey to drive the fomorians underground. 
The giants, now grossly misshapen thanks to a curse 
brought about by their own inner foulness, retreated to the 
Underdark of the Feywild, where they remain today. 
Continued exposure to the Feywild, over a century or 
more, hastens the onset of Remembrance significantly 
among most elves. Elves who have spent most of their 
lives in the Fcywild can experience their first other-life 
memory as early as the age of 200 years. Eladrin aren't 
affected this way. 
Because of their link to the primal elves, eladrin tend 
to be haughty around other elves. They're proud of their 
heritage and equally proud of their ability to thrive in the 
Feywild, a land full of threats that would overwhelm and 
destroy weaker creatures. Some eladrin trade haugh-
tiness for a tender kindness toward their elf cousins, 
knowing that many elves have never felt the ecstasies 
of a life amid the fey and of years spent near the ancient 
shrines and other glories created by the primal elves 
who first arrived in Faerie. These kinder eladrin take a 
special pleasure in introducing their realm to others. 
Eladrin cities represent the pinnacle of elven architec-
ture. Their soaring towers, arching bridges, and grace-
fully filigreed homes are a perfect blend of construction 
natural elements, and magic-inspired motifs. Streams ' 
and waterfalls, gardens and copses, and structures of 
stone and wood are commingled in ways that are origi-
nal and yet completely natural-looking. 
Eladrin culture is older than any other elven civiliza-
tion, and it's also the most decadent. Most elves are im-
petuous to some extent, but eladrin are known for their 
fickleness. Many of them change their minds on the 
spur of the moment without giving reasons. Their sys-
tem of justice vacillates between capriciously harsh and 
whimsically mild, depending on the mood of the eladrin 
passing judgment, and eladrin are more susceptible to 
flattery than other elves are. 
Elves from the Material Plane who have researched 
eladrin culture blame these traits on the influence of the 
Feywild. As part of their argument, they point out that 
eladrin who spend a significant amount of time on the 
Material Plane- adventurers and scholars, primarily-
still demonstrate these attitudes, but to a lesser degree. 
Although eladrin have the closest connection to Corel-
Ion because of their ancestry, they are alone among 
elves in feeling little affinity for Arvandor. Eladrin don't 
long to end their cycle of rebirth and rejoin Corellon, 
but rather to meld with the Feywild when they are rein-
carnated. They believe that an eladrin who excels in life 
throughout a series of incarnations can eventually come 
back as a member of the Seelie or Unseelie court or, in 
extreme cases, even as an archfey. 
CHAPTER 2 I El.VES 
DROW 
When the primal elves chose to take the forms of mor-
tals, they were one people split by conflicting loyalty to 
gods who reviled each other. The schism led to a conflict 
that ended with Lolth retreating to the Abyss and her 
adherents exiled to the Underdark. This banishment en-
abled the victors to once again live in peace on Arvandor 
but did nothing to heal the rift. 
The vanquished elves weren't seen or heard from 
again for centuries. Throughout that age of residing in 
the darkness, absorbing the unhealthy emanations of 
the Underdark, subsisting on its tainted water and food, 
and always beseeching their god for guidance and fol-
lowing her poisonous dictates, Lolth's worshipers gradu-
ally transformed into the drow: the cruel, predatory, and 
wicked offshoot of the elf race. 
REFLECTIONS OF LOLTH --------
From the time they're old enough to understand, drow 
are taught that they're superior to all other creatures, for 
they remain steadfast in their devotion to Lolth despite 
the hardships of their existence. Any creature that isn't 
a drow is useful only as a sacrifice to Lolth as a slave 
or as fodder for the giant spiders that the d~ow train t~ 
patrol their cities and tunnels. 
Among these other, lesser forms of life, the elves that 
live in sunlight are especially despised because they are 
descended from the primal elves who betrayed Lolth so 
long ago. First they accepted Lolth's offer of mortality in 
return for destiny, but then they turned against her in a 
pathetic effort to win back Corellon's favor. Drow view 
the elves of the surface world as cowardly children who 
defy their parents when they're not around but cower in 
the corner when their parents return, terrified of having 
their bad behavior found out. 
Reverence for Lolth touches every aspect of drow life. 
All dark elves constantly watch for signs of her favor. 
Any incident or physical feature can be interpreted as 
such a sign, and priestesses are quick to attach mean-
ings to obscure omens that benefit their own interests. 
All this effort to please Lolth is a wise precaution. 
Though she resides in the Abyss, the Spider Queen isn't 
a distant god. She sometimes tests her most faithful by 
drawing their spirits to her in the Demonweb to undergo 
her judgment. Followers never know when or if they are 
to be tested. One who claims to have undergone the test 
and passed it is rewarded with respect and elevated sta-
tus. Even someone who successfully lies about having 
taken the test can earn the respect of their peers, since 
perpetrating this falsehood is a way of proving one's 
worth to Lolth. Lying and conniving can't save those 
who fail the test, however, because the evidence of such 
an outcome is immediately obvious- a drow whose 
spirit has failed its test in the Demonweb Pits becomes 
transformed into a drider. 
When Lolth is well served, she rewards her faithful 
with favors. When she is defied, she visits the Underdark 
in one of her forms and takes a direct hand in punishing 
the malefactor in a manner that discourages anyone 
who might be contemplating a similar kind of disobedi-
ence. Perhaps making an example of malcontents in this 
way is simply an aspect of how Lolth's cruel personality
