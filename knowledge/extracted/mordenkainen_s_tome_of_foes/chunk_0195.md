TROLLS 
Trolls that are nearly obliterated but survive and re-
generate from mere scraps of flesh can display bizarre 
mutations. One of these warped trolls is especially 
likely to arise if the creature regenerates in the pres-
ence of magical emanations, planar energy, disease, 
or death on a vast scale, or if its body was damaged 
by elemental forces. These mutated forms can also 
be produced and shaped by the ritual magic of evil 
spellcasters.

DIRE 'TROLL 
Trolls kill and eat almost anything- including, in rare 
cases, other trolls. This cannibalism has the effect of 
causing the troll to grow to an unusually large size. 
These dire trolls crave more and more troll flesh to fuel 
their continued growth. 
Dire trolls also increase their size by grafting flesh 
and organs onto themselves. When a slab of quivering 
troll flesh is bound against a fresh wound on the dire 
troll, its regenerative capacity incorporates the new 
mass into its own musculature. Even more horrifying 
are the multiple arms, eyes, claws, and other organs that 
a dire troll tears from its victims and grafts onto itself. 
Over time, these creatures can accumulate many limbs. 
VAPRAK THE DESTROYER 
Although trolls are hardly devout and seldom ponder spir-
itual questions, they do fear and venerate the entity known 
as Vaprak the Destroyer. As with many lesser deities, 
Vaprak's true nature is something of a mystery, but it is 
always portrayed as a horrid, misshapen, greenish creature 
strongly resembling a troll. It's given to fits of mindless 
destruction and is constantly paranoid about the plots and 
ambitions of other deities. 
Among trolls, Vaprak is believed to devour those on the 
brink of death, but only if the troll is already cooked or 
digested (slain by fire or acid). Otherwise, the god spits 
the soul back into the world to regenerate a new body, no 
matter how little of its previous form remained. Thus, only 
trolls slain by acid or fire remain dead, because only those 
are consumed by Vaprak.
