ZARIEL'S LAIR 
Zariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up 
in Avernus. From nearly a mile away, one can hear the 
screams and moans coming from the burned victims 
chained to the stronghold's wall, the dying remains of 
those who failed to impress the archdevil. The strong-
hold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls 
reinforced with high turrets. Devils of all kinds crawl 
over the structure, ensuring that no intruders breach 
their defenses. 
Lair Actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative 
ties), Zariel can take a lair action to cause one of the 
following effects; she can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row: 
• Zariel casts major image four times at its lowest 
level, targeting different areas with the spell. Zariel 
prefers to create images of intruders' loved ones be-
ing burned alive. Zariel doesn't need to concentrate 
on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the 
next round. Each creature that can see these illusions 
must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or 
become frightened of the illusion for 1 minute. A 
frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on 
a success. 
• Zariel casts her innate fireball spell. 
Re,ional Effects. The region containing Zariel's lair 
is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of 
the following effects: 
• The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with 
screaming voices and the stench of burning meat. 
• Once every 60 feet within 1 mile of the lair, 10-foot-
high gouts of flame rise from the ground. Any creature 
or object that touches the flame takes 7 (2d6) fire 
damage, though it can take this damage no more than 
once per round. 
• The area within 2 miles, but no closer than 500 
feet, of the lair is filled with smoke, which causes 
the area to be heavily obscured. The smoke can't be 
cleared away. 
If Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of 
ldlO days.

DROW 
Whether they are found in Underdark cities, the dark-
ened passages between them, or in the dreaded Demon-
web Pits, drow stand as one of the most insidious 
threats to surface-dwellers. Devoted to Lolth, the dark 
elves obey her often-contradictory commands and live 
in fear of her wrath. Some attain great power and in-
fluence through cunning, talent, or subterfuge, evoking 
fear from the lesser drow who serve them.
