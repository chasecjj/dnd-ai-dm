GIT HZERAI 
The githzerai were born as a race at the end of the git h's 
bloody, genocidal uprising against the mind flayers. A 
gith named Zerthimon, who had gained a significant fol-
lowing during the conflict, challenged Gith's plans and 
her leadership. Gith was evil, the newcomer proclaimed, 
and she would lead the people into darkness and tyr-
anny not unlike the one imposed by the illithids. 
Thus, no sooner had the gith defeated their sworn 
enemies than they were plunged into a bitter civil war. 
In the ensuing conflict, Zerthimon was killed and his 
followers, naming themselves githzerai, relocated their 
civilization to the plane of Limbo. 
Today, under the leadership of the Great Githzerai, 
Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith, the githzerai continue to stand 
fast against the githyanki, as well as taking their re-
venge on the mind flayers. Through forays into the Mate-
rial Plane and other realms, they provide stiff opposition 
to their enemies' plans for world domination. 
ORDER I N A SEA OF CHAOS 
WE GITHZERAI CRAVE A CHALLENGE, SO THAT WHEN 
Zerthimon returns he shall.find us ready. Thus we traueled 
to howling Limbo to make our new home. 
- The Teachings of Menyar-Ag 
Strong-minded philosophers and austere ascetics, the 
githzerai pursue lives of rigid order. Their society fo-
cuses on enhancing the potential of the mind through 
meditation, education, and physical tests. The most 
accomplished among them stand as exemplars of the 
githzerai's monastic principles, but even those who per-
form mundane duties in a community have a significant 
measure of the same mental fortitude. 
Living in the ever-turbulent churn of Limbo requires 
all githzerai to harness the power of thought to coun-
teract and hold at bay the chaos-stuff of the plane. If 
they were not relentless in this effort, the tides of Limbo 
would overwhelm and destroy them. 
The githzerai have a unity of purpose that comes 
from their reverence for their great heroes and their 
desire to emulate the virtues of those figures in their ev-
eryday lives. 
MENYAR-AG, THE GREAT GITHZERAI 
Menyar-Ag led the githzerai into Limbo at the culmina-
tion of the conflict between Gith and Zerthimon. Thanks 
to unimaginable arcane and psionic power, he has sur-
vived far beyond the life span of an ordinary githzerai. 
Time has nevertheless taken its toll, and Menyar-Ag to-
day is a decrepit, corpse-like entity- capable of tremen-
dous feats of magic and psionics but barely able to move 
a finger or lift his own eyelids. A host of servants con-
stantly attend to Menyar-Ag and see to his every need. 
Although Menyar-Ag is no longer capable of physical 
actions of any consequence, his mind is as active and 
sharp as ever. He never sleeps, using a rotating staff of 
attendants to spread his commands and counsel to all 
githzerai. If needed, he can call upon his own psychic 
energy to contact his people, even across the planes. 
ANARCHS 
A githzerai community works constantly to maintain 
a stable base of operations protected from the wilds of 
Limbo. The mental energy of the collective that keeps 
the plane's forces of chaos at bay is funneled through the 
exceptional githzerai known as anarchs. One or more 
anarchs maintain each community by serving as both 
the receptacle for the psychic power of other githzerai 
and the means by which that power is employed. 
Anarchs have a special gift for stabilizing and con-
trolling the chaos-stuff of Limbo. In their communities 
on Limbo, they can create matter and energy out of 
nothingness with a thought. They can control the direc-
tion of gravity. The environment around them can be 
whatever they want it to be. 
Anarchs are exceedingly rare among githzerai. When 
a githzerai in an existing community demonstrates the 
ability to become an anarch, that individual might leave 
the community to found a new colony or might remain 
where it is and ascend to a leadership position. 
ZERTHS 
Zerthimon's mortal form died in battle, but his sacrifice 
freed the githzerai from Gith's dark designs. They be-
lieve that Zerthimon, in his new godly form, will return 
someday and usher them into new age of freedom. Until 
that happens, the githzerai known as zerths fill the 
symbolic role of Zerthimon in society, as accomplished 
wielders of psionic power who can move themselves and 
others between planes. 
The githzerai believe that when Zerthimon returns, he 
will first gather all the zerths and take them to their new 
paradise to prepare it for those who follow. Zerths are 
similar to what other races would call priests, although 
githzerai don't have a religion as such, beyond their ad-
miration for Zerthimon and Menyar-Ag. 
F ORTRESS CITIES 
The monasteries of the githzerai are massive outposts 
of stability that sail through the chaos of Limbo. Githze-
rai anarchs keep the fortresses stable and control their 
interior design, opening portals to the outside only as 
needed. Most fortresses drift through Limbo at random, 
but none of them are ever isolated. When Menyar-Ag 
sends out a call to them, the anarchs of the other com-
munities can instantly communicate with him. 
Aside from its inhabitants, the most well-defended el-
ement of a githzerai fortress is its food supply. Because 
Limbo provides no sustenance, the githzerai rely on 
crops and livestock they appropriate from elsewhere. 
Plants are grown in hydroponic chambers, and livestock 
are raised in pens where light, temperature, and other 
conditions are tailored to their needs. 
A community's activity is overseen by monks who 
assign duties to each occupant. Everyone participates 
in mock combats and ongoing academic instruction, 
and each fortress allocates personnel and resources 
as needed. Every fortress is designed to be self-suffi-
cient, even though no two of them are ever out of psy-
chic contact.
