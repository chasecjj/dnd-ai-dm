moving beforehand if necessary to get in range. If it's holding 
no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is vis· 
ible within 30 feet, it takes the Dash action, moving toward

Magic Resistance. The oaken bolter has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The oaken bolter makes two lancing bolt attacks 
or one lancing bolt attack and one harpoon attack. 
Lancing Bolt. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 
5 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) pierc-
ing damage. 
Harpoon. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 50/200 ft., 
one target. Hit: 9 (ldlO + 4) piercing damage, and the target 
is grappled (escape DC 12). While grappled in this way, a crea-
ture's speed isn't reduced, but it can move only in directions 
that bring it closer to the oaken bolter. A creature takes 5 (ldlO) 
slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and 
fails. As a bonus action, the oaken bolter can pull a creature 
grappled by it 20 feet closer. The oaken bolter can grapple only 
one creature at a time. 
Explosive Bolt (Recharge 5-6). The oaken bolter launches an 
explosive charge at a point within 120 feet. Each creature within 
20 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 17 (5d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one.
