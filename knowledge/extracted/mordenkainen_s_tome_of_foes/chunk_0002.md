PREFACE 
You have in your hands that which you 
covet, just as I promised. It is indeed the 
true worlc of that Oeridian wizard Morden· 
lcainen, althoush penned in larse part by 
his apprentice, Bisby. You didn't know that? 
Yes-the worlc of two &reat wizards for the 
price of one! You should pay me extra. 
Bisby wrote as dictated by his master, 
burdened by the chains of a charm spell. 
Eventually, Mordenkainen released Bisby 
from the spell once he had turned Bisby 
away from his evil ways and Bisby had 
earned Mordenkainen's trust. The last few 
chapters are thus in Mordenkainen's own 
hand. But you'll see the voice of the author 
is the same throushout. 
Funny, isn't it? How all the stories say 
that Mordenkainen rescued Bisby from 
evil? Does Mordenlcainen seem like the lcind 
of person whose virtues outweish his vil-
lainy? Do you think him capable of savin& 
a soul? Does he seem lilce someone who'd 
even care? 
Perhaps it's no accident that this hoolc 
contains Mordenkainen's first expression of 
the Balance. In here, he starts to describe 
the multiverse as a collection of opposin& 
forces, each one tryins to tip the scales of 
fate in its favor. He posits that if any side 
in a stru&&le &rows too powerful, it be-
comes tyrannical. But where does that leave 
us-all the soldiers in all these wars? Surely 
for the soldiers of all sides, a war is better 
when it is over. 
Are you a soldier? What war do you 
fi&ht7 Whose side are you on? Law or 
Chaos? Evil or Good? Can you he sure that 
Mordenlcainen would jud&e you as you 
judse yourself? When he puts his thumb 
on the scales to preserve the Balance, can 
you he certain that the weisht of that fin&er 
will not crush you? 
All this misht seem odd comin& from a 
yu&oloth, hut you should believe me, be-
cause I am in the best position to know: 
endless wars profit only mercenaries and 
arms dealers. Thinlc on this as you peruse 
the wise words of Mordenlcainen.

ABOUT THIS BOOK 
In the worlds of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, conflicts rage 
within mortal realms and in the very domains of the 
gods. This book explores some of the greatest conflicts 
in the D&D multiverse and delves into the cultures of 
the peoples and monsters involved in those conflicts. 
Why do dwarves and duergar hate each other? Why are 
there so many kinds of elves? What lies at the heart of 
the Blood War, the great cosmic struggle between de-
mons and devils that threatens to destroy everything if 
either side were ever to emerge victorious? This book 
provides answers to those questions and many more. 
The first five chapters present material for a Dungeon 
Master to add depth to a campaign that involves the on-
going conflicts described there. Options for players are 
provided as well, including new character races. 
Chapter 6 contains game statistics for dozens of mon-
sters: new demons and devils, several varieties of elves 
and duergar, and a vast array of other creatures from 
throughout the planes of existence. The appendix lets 
you look up stat blocks in this book by challenge rating, 
creature type, and environment. 
A companion to the Monster Manual and Volo'.s Guide 
to Monsters, this book contains the musings of the re-
nowned wizard Mordenkainen from the world of Grey-
hawk. In his travels to other worlds and other planes of 
existence, he has made many friends, and has risked his 
life an equal number of times, to amass the knowledge 
contained herein.
