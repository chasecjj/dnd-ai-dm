DEATHLOCK 
The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron 
is no minor occasion- at least not for the warlock. The 
consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in 
some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a 
bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from 
the dead as a deathlock, a foul undead driven to serve its 
otherworldly patron from beyond the grave. 
An extraordinarily powerful necromancer might 
also discover the dark methods of creating a deathlock 
and then bind it to service, acting in this respect as the 
deathlock's patron. 
Obedient and Obsessed. An overpowering urge to 
serve consumes the mind of a newly awakened death-
lock. All goals and ambitions it had in life that don't 
please its patron fall away as its master's desires be-
come the purpose that drives the deathlock. The crea-
ture immediately resumes work on its patron's behalf. 
Accomplishing a difficult goal might mean the deathlock 
is forced to serve another powerful creature or might 
entail in gathering servants of its own. 
Whatever the goal, it always reflects the patron's in-
terests, ranging from small-scale concerns to matters of 
cosmic scope. A deathlock in the thrall of a fiend might 
work to destroy a specific temple dedicated to a good 
god, while one that serves a Great Old One could be 
charged with hunting for the materials needed to call 
forth a horrifying entity into the world. 
Undead Nature. A deathlock doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
PATRON-S PECIFIC SPELLS 
You can customize a deathlock by replacing some or all of 
the spells in its Spellcasting trait with spells specific to its 
patron. Here are examples.
