0RCUS 
Orcus is the Demon Prince of Undeath, known as the 
Blood Lord. He takes some pleasure in the sufferings 
of the living, but far prefers the company and service of 
the undead. His desire is to see all life quenched and the 
multiverse transformed into a vast necropolis populated 
solely by undead creatures under his command. 
Orcus rewards those who spread death in his name 
by granting them a small portion of his power. The least 
of these become ghouls and zombies who serve in his 
legions, while his favored servants are the cultists and 
necromancers who murder the living and then manipu-
late the dead, emulating their dread master. 
Orcus is a bestial creature of corruption with a dis-
eased, decaying look. He has the lower torso of a goat, 
and a humanoid upper body with a corpulent belly swol-
len with rot. Great bat wings sprout from his shoulders, 
and his head is like the skull of a goat, the flesh nearly 
rotted from it. In one hand, he wields the legendary 
Wand of Ore us, which is described in chapter 7 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide. 
0Rcus's LAIR ---
Orcus makes his lair in the fortress city of Naratyr, 
which is on Thanatos, the layer of the Abyss that he 
rules. Surrounded by a moat fed by the River Styx, 
CHAPTER 6 J ll £STIARY 
Naratyr is an eerily quiet and cold city, its streets often 
empty for hours at a time. The central castle of bone has 
interior walls of flesh and carpets made of woven hair. 
The city contains wandering undead, many of which are 
engaged in continuous battles with one another. 
L AIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Orcus can 
take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he 
can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
• Orcus's voice booms throughout the lair. His utter-
ance causes one creature of his choice to be subjected 
to power word kill (save DC 23). Orcus needn't see the 
creature, but he must be aware that the individual is 
in the lair. 
• Orcus causes up to six corpses within the lair to rise 
as skeletons, zombies, or ghouls. These undead obey 
his telepathic commands, which can reach anywhere 
in the lair. 
• Orcus causes skeletal arms to rise from an area on 
the ground in a 20-foot square that he can see. They 
last until the next initiative count 20. Each creature 
in that area when the arms appear must succeed on 
a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be restrajned until 
the arms disappear or until Orcus releases them (no 
action required).

REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing Orcus's lair is warped by Orcus's 
magic, creating one or more of the following effects: 
• Dead beasts periodically animate as undead mock-
eries of their former selves. Skeletal and zombie ver-
sions of local wildlife are commonly seen in the area. 
• The air becomes filled with the stench of rotting flesh, 
and buzzing flies grow thick within the region, even 
when there is no carrion to be found. 
• If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile 
of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 
Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness 
determined by the Madness of Orcus table. A creature 
that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by 
this regional effect again for 24 hours. 
If Orcus dies, these effects fade over the course of 
ldlO days.

Wand ofOrcus. The wand has 7 charges, and any of its prop-
erties that require a saving throw have a save DC of 18. While 
holding it, Orcus can use an action to cast animate dead, 
blight, or speak with dead. Alternatively, he can expend 1 or 
more of the wand's charges to cast one of the following spells 
from it: circle of death (l charge),jinger of death (l charge), or 
power word kill (2 charges). The wand regains ld4 + 3 charges 
daily at dawn. 
While holding the wand, Orcus can use an action to conjure 
undead creatures whose combined average hit points don't ex-
ceed 500. These undead magically rise up from the ground or 
otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of Orcus 
and obey his commands until they are destroyed or until he 
dismisses them as an action. Once this property of the wand is 
used, the property can't be used again until the next dawn. 
Innate Spe/fcasting. Orcus's spellcasting ability is Charisma 
(spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately 
cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 
MADNESS OF 0RCUS 
If a creature goes mad in Orcus's lair or within line of 
sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Orcus 
table to determine the nature of the madness, which is 
a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon 
Master's Guide for more on madness.

can choose to succeed instead. 
Magic Resistance. Orcus has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Magic Weapons. Orcus's weapon attacks are magical. 
Master of Undeath. When Orcus casts animate dead or create 
undead, he chooses the level at which the spell is cast, and 
the creatures created by the spells remain under his control 
indefinitely. Additionally, he can cast create undead even when 
it isn't night. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. Orcus makes two Wand of Orcus attacks. 
Wand ofOrcus. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 
ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 13

Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
Orcus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options 
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time 
and only at the end of another creature's turn. Orcus regains 
spent legendary actions at the start of his turn. 
Tail. Orcus makes one tail attack. 
A Taste ofUndeath. Orcus casts chill touch (17th level). 
Creeping Death (Costs 2 Actions). Orcus chooses a point on 
the ground that he can see within 100 feet of him. A cylinder 
of swirling necrotic energy 60 feet tall and with a 10-foot 
radius rises from that point and lasts until the end of Or-
cus's next turn. Creatures in that area have vulnerability to 
necrotic damage.
