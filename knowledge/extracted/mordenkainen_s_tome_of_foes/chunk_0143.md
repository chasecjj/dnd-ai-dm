Regional Effects. The region containing Geryon's lair 
is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the fol-
lowing effects: 
• Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the lair fre-
quently see shimmering portals leading to places they 
consider safe. Passing through a portal always depos-
its a traveler somewhere in Stygia. 
• Freezing strong winds howl around the area within 1 
mile of the lair. 
• Howls and screams fill the air within 1 mile of the lair. 
Any creature that finishes a short or long rest in this 
area must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw 
or derive no benefit from the rest. 
If Geryon dies, these effects fade over the course of 
ldlO days.
