nought has two gnarled limbs that end in razor-sharp 
pincer claws. Constellations appear to swirl in the 
depths of its single eye, and its serpentine, armored tail 
trails off into the silvery void. 
An astral dreadnought lives a solitary existence. On 
the rare occasion when two dreadnoughts meet, they 
typically fight until one tires of the conflict and departs. 
Some mighty villains have enslaved astral dreadnoughts 
and used them to terrifying effect. 
Ant/magic Eye. Astral sailors claim that insanity 
awaits anyone who gazes into the eye of an astral dread-
nought. What one sees reflected in that starry void is 
the sudden, terrifying realization of one's own mortal-
ity. Spellcasters have cause to fear the eye more than 
others, since it emits a continuous antimagic field. The 
dreadnought can shut off the effect by simply closing its 
eye, though it seldom has reason to do so. 
Astral Predator. A remorseless, indiscriminate 
hunter, an astral dreadnought employs terrifying, if un-
imaginative, tactics. It uses its teeth and claws to tear 
apart its prey. Instinctively aware of how dangerous 
spellcasters can be, it maneuvers to keep as many oppo-
nents as possible within its antimagic gaze. 
An astral dreadnought doesn't have a gullet or a di-
gestive system. Anything it swallows is deposited in a 
unique demiplane- an enclosed space that contains 
eons worth of detritus, as well as the remains of dead 
planar travelers. The place has gravity and breathable 
air, and organic matter decays there. Although escape 
from the demiplane is possible with the aid of magic, 
most creatures arrive here only after they have died. 
When the dreadnought dies, its demiplane vanishes, 
and its contents are released into the Astral Plane. 
An astral dreadnought doesn't communicate. It simply 
consumes any prey it finds, then continues its silent pa-
trol. It can't leave the Astral Plane, nor would it want to. 
Titans of the Chained God. Tharizdun, the Chained 
God, created astral dreadnoughts to devour planar trav-
elers who were seeking portals that lead from the Astral 
Plane to the Outer Planes- portals they might use to 
gaze upon their gods or realize some dream of godhood. 
Astral dreadnoughts don't procreate, so their popula-
tion can't grow. Even though githyanki and other astral 
voyagers hunt the creatures, they rarely see any success, 
and the dreadnoughts aren't in danger of becoming ex-
tinct anytime soon. 
Titanic Nature. Although it eats and sleeps if it so 
desires, an astral dreadnought doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
BALHANNOTH 
Native to the Shadowfell, the vicious, predatory balhan-
noth alters reality in its lair to make the place appear in-
viting to travelers. Once they step inside, the balhannoth 
springs its trap. 
False Hope. Thanks to a limited form of telepathy, 
a balhannoth can sense the desires of other creatures 
and identify images of places where they expect those 
desires to be met. The balhannoth then warps reality 
around it, remaking its environment so that it matches 
the appearance of the place the creature seeks. The bal-
hannoth never quite gets all the details right, and plenty 
of incongruities might give away the deception, but the 
imitation is good enough to fool desperate creatures into 
stumbling into the monster's clutches. 
Malevolent Entities. A balhannoth thrives on fear and 
despair, taking pleasure in the horror its victims expe-
rience. It terrorizes its prey by using its reality-warping 
powers to mask its presence until it can snatch the tar-
get. Then it teleports away to feed on its victims. 
Useful Slaves. Drow hunting parties and other deni-
zens of the Underdark sometimes venture into the Shad-
owfell to capture balhannoths. They install the crea-
tures as guardians, protecting passages from enemy 
intruders and cutting off avenues of retreat or watching 
over slaves. 
A BALHANNOTH'S LAIR 
In the Shadowfell, balhannoths make their lairs near 
places inhabited by creatures they hunt. They typically 
haunt well-traveled roads and paths, snatching people 
who come along. A balhannoth that has been captured 
and exploited by drow might lair in caves near Un-
derdark passages and guard the ways in and out of a 
drow enclave. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
When fighting inside its lair, a balhannoth can use lair 
actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a 
balhannoth can take one lair action to cause one of the 
following effects; the balhannoth can't use the same lair 
action two rounds in a row: 
• The balhannoth warps reality around it in an area up 
to 500 feet square. After 10 minutes, the terrain in the 
area reshapes to assume the appearance of a location 
sought by one intelligent creature whose mind the 
balhannoth has read (see Regional Effects below). The 
transformation affects nonliving material only and 
can't create anything with moving parts or magical 
properties. Any object created in this area is, upon 
close inspection, revealed as a fake. Books are filled 
with empty pages, golden items are obvious counter-
feits, and so on. The transformation lasts until the bal-
hannoth dies or uses this lair action again. 
• The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet 
of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom sav-
ing throw or the target, along with whatever it is wear-
ing and carrying, teleports to an unoccupied space of 
the balhannoth's choice within 60 feet of it.
