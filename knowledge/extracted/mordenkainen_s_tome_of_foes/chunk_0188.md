STAR SPAWN MANGLER 
~~~~~~~~-
A mangler is a low-slung, creeping horror with multiple 
gangly arms. A mangler most often has six arms, but 
one can have any number from four to eight. Manglers 
creep along the ground or the walls, sticking to shad-
ows, hiding in spots that seem too shallow or well-lit to 
conceal anything. They appear smaller than their true 
size, thanks to their hunched posture and emaciated 
frame. Cultists summon these creatures to serve as 
guards and assassins, two roles at which they excel.

Out-of-Phase Movement. The seer can move through other 
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Each crea· 
ture it moves through takes S (ldlO) psychic damage; no crea-
ture can take this damage more than once per turn. The seer 
takes 5 (ldlO) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The seer makes two comet staff attacks or uses 
Psychic Orb twice. 
Comet Staff. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach S ft., one 
target. Hit: 9 (ld6 + 6) bludgeoning damage, or 10 (ld8 + 6) 
bludgeoning damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (4d8) 
psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Con-
stitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its 
next turn. 
Psychic Orb. Ranged Spell Attack: +11 to hit, range 120 feet, one 
target. Hit: 27 (SdlO) psychic damage. 
Collapse Distance (Recharge 6). The seer warps space around a 
creature it can see within 30 feet of it. That creature must make 
a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target, 
along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, is magically 
teleported up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space the seer can 
see, and all other creatures within 10 feet of the target's origi-
nal space each takes 39 (6dl2) psychic damage. On a success-
ful save, the target takes 19 (3dl 2) psychic damage. 
REACTIONS 
Bend Space. When the seer would be hit by an attack, it tele-
ports, exchanging positions with another star spawn it can 
see within 60 feet ofit. The other star spawn is hit by the at-
tack instead.
