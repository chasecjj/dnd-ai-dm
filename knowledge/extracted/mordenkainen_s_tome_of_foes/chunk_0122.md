DEMONS: DEMON LORDS 
This section provides game statistics for the demon 
lords who are detailed in chapter 1. They are incredibly 
formidable opponents. 
BAPHOMET 
Civilization is weakness and savagery is strength in the 
credo of Baphomet, the Horned King and the Prince of 
Beasts. He rules over minotaurs and others with savage 
hearts. He is worshiped by those who want to break the 
confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures, for 
Baphomet envisions a world without restraint, where 
creatures live out their most savage desires. 
Cults devoted to Baphomet use mazes and complex 
knots as their emblems, creating secret places to in-
dulge themselves, including labyrinths of the sort their 
master favors. Bloodstained crowns and weapons of 
iron and brass decorate their profane altars. 
Over time, Baphomet's cultists become tainted by his 
influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse, thicken-
ing hair. Small horns eventually sprout from the fore-
head. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely 
into a minotaur-considered the greatest gift of the 
Prince of Beasts. 
Baphomet appears as a great, black-furred minotaur, 
20 feet tall with six iron horns. An infernal light burns 
in his red eyes. Although he is filled with bestial blood 
lust, there lies within him a cruel and cunning intellect 
devoted to subverting all of civilization. 
Baphomet wields a great glaive called Heartcleaver. 
He sometimes casts this deadly weapon aside so that he 
can charge his enemies and gore them with his horns, 
trampling them into the earth and rending them with 
his teeth like a beast. 
BAPHOMET
1S LAIR 
Baphomet's lair is his palace, the Lyktion, which is on 
the layer of the Abyss called the Endless Maze. Nes-
tled within the twisting passages of the plane-wide 
labyrinth, the Lyktion is immaculately maintained and 
surrounded by a moat constructed in the fashion of 
a three-dimensional maze. The palace is a towering 
structure whose interior is as labyrinthine as the plane 
on which it resides, populated by minotaurs, goristros, 
and quasits. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), 
Baphomet can-take a lair action to cause one of 
the following magical effects; he can't use the 
same effect two rounds in a row: 
• Baphomet seals one doorway or other en-
tryway within the lair. The opening must 
be unoccupied. It is filled with solid 
stone for 1 minute or until Baphomet 
creates this effect again. 
CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
• 
Baphomet chooses a room within the lair that is no 
larger in any dimension than 100 feet. Until the next 
initiative count 20, gravity is reversed within that 
room. Any creatures or objects in the room when this 
happens fall in the direction of the new pull of grav-
ity, unless they have some means of remaining aloft. 
Baphomet can ignore the gravity reversal if he's in the 
room, although he likes to use this action to land on a 
ceiling to attack targets flying near it. 
• Baphomet casts mirage arcane, affecting a room 
within the lair that is no larger in any dimension 
than 100 feet. The effect ends on the next initia-
tive count 20.
