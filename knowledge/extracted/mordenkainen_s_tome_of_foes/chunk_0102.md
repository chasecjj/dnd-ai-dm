CHAPTER 6: 
BESTIARY 
HIS BESTIARY PROVIDES GAME STATISTICS 
and lore for more than a hundred monsters 
suitable for any D&D campaign, including 
old favorites from past editions of the game 
as well as original creations. Among those 
returning to the fold are the berbalang, the 
iron cobra, the spirit troll, the meazel, and 
the vampiric mist, all of which trace their lineage back 
to the original Fiend Folio published in 1981. 
Many of these monsters, old and new alike, are ideal 
for use with the earlier chapters of this book. For in-
stance, the demons and devils presented here- lesser 
varieties as well as the greatest of the demon lords and 
the archdevils- can add even more chaos and savagery 
to a campaign based on the Blood War. 
Similarly, you'll find a selection of specialized duergar 
to spice up a game that involves the characters in the 
struggle described in chapter 3. 
The ranks of the drow and the shadar-kai are swelled 
by the addition of special individuals that can add 
depth- and danger- to adventures that take heroes into 
the Underdark or the Shadowfell. 
Or, if you're interested in exploring either side of the 
conflict between the gith that's portrayed in chapter 4, 
the bestiary has new versions of githyanki and githzerai 
that supplement the Monster Manual entries for those 
creatures. 
This chapter is a continuation of the Monster Manual 
and adopts a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar 
with the monster stat block format, read the introduc-
tion of the Monster Manual before proceeding further. It 
explains stat block terminology and gives rules for vari-
ous monster traits- information that isn't repeated here. 
As with the monsters in the Monster Manual, we've 
tried to capture the essence of each creature and focus 
on those traits that make it unique or that encourage 
DMs to use it. You can do what you will with these mon-
sters and change their lore to suit your game. Nothing 
we say here is meant to curtail your creativity. 
The creatures in this bestiary are organized alphabet-
ically. A few are grouped under a banner heading; for 
example, the "Demons" section contains stat blocks for 
various kinds of demons, which are presented alphabeti-
cally within that section. 
Following this chapter is an appendix that contains 
lists of the creatures arranged by type, challenge rating, 
and environment. DMs can use these lists, in conjunc-
tion with similar information in the Dungeon Master's 
Guide and other sources, to choose monsters for a par-
ticular adventure or campaign.

ALLIP 
When a mind uncovers a secret that a powerful being 
has protected with a mighty curse, the result is often the 
emergence of an allip. Secrets protected in this manner 
range in scope from a demon lord's true name to the 
hidden truths of the cosmic order. The allip acquires 
the secret, but the curse annihilates its body and leaves 
behind a spectral creature composed of fragments from 
the victim's psyche and overwhelming psychic agony. 
Blasphem ous Secr ets. Every allip is wracked with 
a horrifying insight that torments what remains of its 
mind. In the presence of other creatures, an allip seeks 
to relieve this burden by sharing its secret. The creature 
can impart only a shard of the knowledge that doomed 
it, but that piece is enough to wrack the recipient with 
temporary madness. The survivors of an allip's attack 
are sometimes left with a compulsion to learn more 
about what spawned this monstrosity. S trange phrases 
echo through their minds, and weird visions occupy 
their dreams. The sense that some colossal truth sits 
just outside their recall plagues them for days, months, 
and sometimes years after their fateful encounter. 
Undead Nature. An allip doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
INSIDIOUS LORE 
An allip might attempt to share its lore to escape its curse 
and enter the afterlife. It can transfer knowledge from its 
mind by guiding another creature to write down what it 
knows. This process takes days or possibly weeks. An allip 
can accomplish this task by lurking in the study or work-
place of a scholar. If the allip remains hidden, its victim is 
gradually overcome by manic energy. A scholar, driven by 
sudden insights to work night and day, produces reams of 
text with little memory of exactly what the documents con-
tain. If the allip succeeds, it passes from the world-and 
its terrible secret hides somewhere in the scholar's text, 
waiting to be discovered by its next victim.

Incorporeal Movement. The allip can move through other 
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 
(ldlO) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 
A CTIONS 
Maddening Touch. Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage. 
Whispers of Madness. The allip chooses up to three creatures it 
can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 
14 Wisdom saving throw, or it takes 7 (ld8 + 3) psychic dam-
age and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack 
against one creature of the allip's choice that the allip can see. 
Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. 
Howling Babble (Recharge 6). Each creatu re within 30 feet of 
the allip that can hear it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving 
throw. On a failed save, a target takes 12 (2d8 + 3) psychic 
damage, and it is stunned until the end of its next turn. On 
a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't 
stunned. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.
