Annihilating Aura. Any creature that starts its turn within 30 
feet of the nightwalker must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution 
saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and grant the 
nightwalker advantage on attack rolls against it until the start 
of the creature's next turn. Undead are immune to this aura. 
CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
N IGHTWALK ER 
The Negative Plane is a place of darkness and death, 
anathema to all living things. Yet there are those who 
would tap into its fell power. to use its energy for sinister 
ends. Most often, when such individuals approach the 
midnight realm, they find they are unequal to the task. 
Those not destroyed outright are sometimes drawn in-
side the plane and replaced by nightwalkers, terrifying 
undead creatures that devour all life they encounter. 
Mighty Spawn. One can reach the Negative Plane 
from the Shadowfell, much in the same way that it 
is possible to step from the Material Plane into the 
S hadowfell in a place where the barrier between the 
planes is thin. 
Stepping into the Negative Plane is tantamount to 
suicide, since the plane sucks the life and soul from 
such audacious creatures and annihilates them at 
once. Those few who survive the effort do so by sheer 
luck or by harnessing some rare form of magic that 
protects them against the hostile atmosphere. They 
soon discover, however, that they can't leave as easily 
as they arrived. For each creature that enters the plane, 
a nightwalker is released to take its place. In order for 
a trapped creature to escape, the released nightwalker 
must be lured back to the Negative Plane by offerings of 
life for it to devour. If the nightwalker is destroyed, the 
trapped creature has no hope of escape. 
Beings of Anti-Life. One can discern the nature of 
creatures trapped in the Negative Plane from the sites 
that nightwalkers frequent. Generally, a nightwalker on 
the Material Plane is attracted to elements of the world 
associated with the creature responsible for its creation. 
Such interest doesn't indicate a willingness to engage 
with the world; nightwalkers exist to make life extinct 
and never to serve living things. 
Undead Nature. A nightwalker doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep. 
Life Eater. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from damage 
dealt by the nightwalker dies and can't be revived by any means 
short of a wish spell. 
ACT ION S 
Multiattack. The nightwalker uses Enervating Focus twice, or it 
uses Enervating Focus and Finger of Doom, if available. 
Enervating Focus. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 
ft., one target. Hit: 28 (5d8 + 6) necrotic damage. The target 
must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or its hit 
point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic 
damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a 
long rest. 
Finger of Doom (Recharge 6). The nightwalker points at one 
creature it can see within 300 feet ofit. The target must 
succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4dl 2) 
necrotic damage and become frightened until the end of the 
nightwalker's next turn. While frightened in this way, the crea-
ture is also paralyzed. If a target's saving throw is successful, 
the target is immune to the nightwalker's Finger of Doom for 
the next 24 hours.
