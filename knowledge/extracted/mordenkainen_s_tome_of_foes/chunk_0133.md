Derro slink through the subterranean realms, seeking 
places that are safe from the perils of the Underdark. 
Equal parts fearful and vicious, bands of these dwarf-
kin prey on those weaker than themselves, while giving 
simpering obeisance to any creatures they deem more 
powerful. Wild-haired, haggard, shuddering, and shab-
bily dressed, a lone derro seems a pitiable creature, but 
when a cackling, spitting, growling, howling horde of 
them attacks, the sight inspires both fear and revulsion. 
Madness and Sorcery. Fractious in groups and 
individually weak, derro would have been driven to 
extinction long ago but for two elements of their char-
acter. They have an inborn tendency toward paranoia, 
a peculiarity that serves them well as they navigate the 
dangers of the Underdark and its societies. They also 
have a stronger-than-normal tendency to develop sorcer-
ous power. Individuals who do so become their leaders, 
known as savants. The derro consider these sorcerers 
to be specially blessed by their deity, Diirinka. 
Forgotten Duergar. Grandiose fantasies and rampant 
fanaticism have obscured the true origin of the derro, 
even among themselves. Most dwarves don't recognize 
derro as kin, but the legends that the derro tell about 
their race and the story that the duergar believe share a 
grain of truth. 
According to the duergar, the derro are descended 
from dwarves of a clan that was left behind when the 
others escaped the mind flayers' rule. They eventually 
also got away, but not before becoming demented and 
contorted. 
The derro tell their own story of flight and survival 
in the Underdark, and the mind flayers aren't always 
the enemy. Laduguer and Deep Duerra don't feature in 
their mythic history. Instead they tell of two brothers, 
Diirinka and Diinkarazan, and of how Diirinka cleverly 
betrayed his sibling so that he could steal magical power 
from the evil they escaped. The danger the brothers are 
said to face in this legend varies, depending on whatever 
foe the savants want to lead their people against, yet the 
essence of the story remains the same: a lesson of sur-
vival at any price and an example of how deceitfulness 
and cruelty can be virtues.
