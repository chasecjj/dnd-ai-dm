Spell Leech. As a bonus action, this creature chooses one ally 
it can see within 30 feet of it. The target loses its lowest-level 
spell slot, and this creature gains it. 
CULT OF ZARIEL 
Goals: Conquest, glory in battle, fame and fortune de-
rived from military victory 
Typical Cultist: Berserker, cult fanatic, cultist, gladiator, 
guard, knight, veteran 
Signature S pells: True strike (cantrip), heroism (1st 
level), spiritual weapon (2nd level), crusader's mantle 
(3rd level) 
Zariel's cult offers martial training and talent. It flour-
ishes in areas wracked by war. Refugees with the will to 
fight but lacking experience are drawn to Zariel, as she 
can provide them with the skills needed to survive. Es-
tablished warriors looking for an edge are otherwise her 
most common recruits. 
Knightly orders, fighters' guilds, and mercenary 
companies are the most likely to come under her sway. 
Hobgoblins sometimes turn to her, but only if they have 
escaped the influence of Maglubiyet and his priests. 
Zariel's cultists can gain the Ferocious Surge trait. 
Cult leaders can also gain the Infernal Tactics trait. 
Ferocious Surge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). When 
this creature hits with an attack that isn't a critical hit, it can 
turn the hit into a critical hit. 
Infernal Tactics. This creature has a keen eye for seizing a 
tactical advantage. Immediately after rolling initiative, it can 
choose itself and up to three allies it can see if it isn't incapaci· 
tated. It can swap the initiative results of the chosen creatures 
among them. 
I NFERNAL C AMBIONS 
Some archdevils consort with mortals to produce cam-
bion offspring. While most have the typical abilities for a 
cambion (as detailed in the Monster Manual), some gain 
abilities reminiscent of their archdevil parent. 
SIGNATURE SPELLS 
Cambions have the Innate Spellcasting trait. When cus-
tomizing an infernal cambion, you can replace spells in 
that trait with ones of the same level from the list of sig-
nature spells in the cult entry of the devilish parent. The 
cambion can use these spells once per day each. 
SPECIAL TRAITS 
A cambion linked to a specific devil typically gains any 
special traits conferred to that devil's cultists. 
Some devils grant a unique ability to their spawn that 
replaces the cambion's Fiendish Charm trait; Zariel 
and Geryon have a penchant for spawning cambions 
to serve as war leaders among their followers. The two 
of them grant the Fury of the Nine ability in place of 
Fiendish Charm. 
Fury of the Nine. As a bonus action, the cambion chooses an-
other creature that can see or hear it within 120 feet. That crea· 
ture gains advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws for 
the next minute or until the cambion uses this ability again. 
TIEFLING SUBRACES 
At the DM's option. you can create a tiefling character 
who has a special link to one of the Lords of the Nine 
Hells. This link is represented by a subrace. 
If your tiefling has a subrace, choose one of the follow-
ing options- whichever one corresponds to the infernal 
being connected to the tiefling's family. 
The traits of the chosen subrace replace the tiefling's 
Ability Score Increase and Infernal Legacy traits given 
in the Player's Handbook. There is one exception: tief-
lings connected to Asmodeus. Those tieflings use the 
traits in the Player's Handbook. 
ASMODEUS 
The tieftings connected to Nessus command the power 
of fire and darkness, guided by a keener than normal in-
tellect, as befits those linked to Asmodeus himself. Such 
tieflings use the Ability Score Increase and Infernal 
Legacy traits in the Player's Handbook. 
BAALZEBUL 
The crumbling realm of Maladomini is ruled by Baalze-
bul, who excels at corrupting those whose minor sins 
can be transformed into acts of damnation. Tieflings 
linked to this archdevil can corrupt others both physi-
cally and psychically. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score in-
creases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1. 
LegacyofMaladomini. You know the thaumaturgy 
cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the ray 
of sickness spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait 
and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long 
rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the crown 
of madness spell once with this trait and regain the abil-
ity to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for these spells. 
DISPATER 
The great city of Dis occupies most of Hell's second 
layer. It is a place where secrets are uncovered and 
shared with the highest bidder, making tieflings tied to 
Dispater excellent spies and infiltrators. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score in-
creases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1. 
Legacy of Dis. You know the thaumaturgycantrip. 
When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the disguise 
self spell once with this trait and regain the ability to 
do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th 
level, you can cast the detect thoughts spell once with 
this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish 
a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for 
these spells. 
FI ERNA 
A master manipulator, Fierna grants tieftings tied to her 
forceful personalities. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score in-
creases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.
