OTHER D EITIES 
The dwarvcn pantheon is quite large. The four deities 
discussed above are acknowledged by occupants of 
almost every stronghold, while the following gods are 
worshiped by some clans and ignored by others. These 
deities include Dugmaren Brightmantle, the Gleam in 
the Eye; Dumathoin, the Keeper of Secrets under the 
Mountain; Corm Gulthyn, the Golden Guardian; Haela 
Brightaxe, the Lady of the Fray; Marthammor Duin, 
Watcher over Wanderers; Sharindlar, Lady of Mercy; 
and Vergadain, the Merchant King. 
THE DUAL ROLE OF ABBATHOR 
A LllTLE ACT OF SELFISHNESS NOW AND THEN IS TO BE 
expected even from the wisest of folk. 
-Tenelar, Outcast of Five Peaks 
Dwarves have rigid principles and lofty ambitions. They 
devote their lives to the pursuit of perfection, and the 
best come close to realizing that goal. But for all their 
dedication, dwarves are mortal, which means they are 
fallible. And that's where Abbathor comes in. 
The dwarves' attachment to their creations has a dark 
side: many of them fall victim to feelings of selfishness 
and greed. The culprit is Abbathor, the black sheep 
of the dwarven pantheon. Abbathor is an advocate of 
change, not stability- an attitude normally regarded 
with suspicion by dwarves. But in this case, the god de-
livers his message inside the embrace of avarice. 
Greed is at the heart of change. Greedy individuals 
aren't content with their own accomplishments and seek

to undermine the works that others have made, some-
times going so far as to take credit for their creation, or 
actually steal them. Greed distorts the joy that dwarves 
normally take from their work. It focuses on the value 
of the end result, rather than the importance of the pro-
cess of creation. A dwarf tempted by Abbathor might 
sabotage a rival's work or uncover a wondrous treasure 
and pass it off as something they created. 
Abbathor does, however, play a positive role in helping 
the dwarves discover new methods and techniques. Al-
though he espouses greed and treachery, he is also the 
standard bearer for revision and innovation. His guid-
ance is especially critical when a clan faces an unantici-
pated situation that requires quick, decisive action. 
In that vein, dwarf emissaries and merchants are 
expected to use Abbathor's tricks when they deal with 
humans, elves, and other races. When a dwarf offers a 
piece of merchandise for sale to an outsider, that mer-
chant is expected to drive a hard bargain, even if the 
item is in truth an inferior example of its kind. 
Fortunately for the other party in the arrangement, 
the dwarves' idea of "inferior" means that a product they 
consider substandard is still far superior to any such 
item that outsiders might create. The dwarves might 
laugh among themselves at a human farmer who bought 
a shovel from them that will last only a few decades. To 
the dwarves, that's a shoddy tool; to the farmer, it's a 
purchase that lasts a lifetime. 
ENEMIES ALL AROUND 
If the dwarves weren't so good at accumulating trea-
sure, it's likely that they wouldn't have as many ene-
mies. As things stand, however, almost every variety of
