arms, and upper torso of a strong male drow and the 
lower body of a scorpion. The dark elves of Eberron 
revere scorpions, seeing spiders and other arachnids to 
be lesser servitors of Vulkoor. Many drow believe that 
Vulkoor and the Mockery (one of the group of evil deities 
known as the Dark Six) are one and the same. Drow 
from the jungle continent of Xen'drik ritually tattoo 
themselves using scorpion venom, leaving white scars 
etched into their skin. 
Drow of other worlds rarely know ofVulkoor. Those 
who are familiar with his name consider him one of the 
weakest of the Dark Seldarine, a subordinate of Lolth 
who is disregarded by the other gods. Both visions of 
Vulkoor might be accurate, since Lolth seems to have 
little influence in Khyber but the drow there bear many 
similarities to the Lolth-worshiping drow of other 
realms throughout the multiverse. 
THE D EMONWEB CONNECTION 
Lolth's personal realm is a layer of the Abyss known col-
loquially as the Demonweb Pits. Far from being intimi-
dated by their deity's connection to the Abyss, the drow 
revel in it- sometimes literally. 
Drow have respect for the power of demons, but they 
don't fear them the way most other mortal creatures do. 
A drow who calls up a demon from the Abyss into the 
Underdark wants something from it, typically a means 
of improving one's status or gaining leverage against en-
emies. A demon that answers the call wants something 
in return: an opportunity to spread carnage, to curry 
Lolth's favor, or to accomplish something more devious. 
As long as both sides get what they want, these arrange-
ments conclude without further incident. 
Every so often, a demon summoning goes badly. Per-
haps the drow intended to trap the demon into servitude 
but took inadequate precautions, or the demon was wil-
ier than usual, or the call was answered by a being more 
powerful than the summoner could handle. Calling 
forth a demon and failing to rein it in is a capital crime 
in most drow communities- an uncontrolled demon 
often spells disaster not only for the drow who pulled it 
from the Abyss but for the summoner's entire house. 
A demon is the highest form of slave a drow house can 
own. There's no better display of a house's power than 
a demon kept shackled as it serves its master, and few 
more potent ways of striking fear in an enemy's heart. 
Demons are also sometimes sought after as house 
guests. The occasion of a major sacrifice, the dedication 
of a newborn daughter to Lolth, or even a lavish banquet 
takes on greater significance and imparts more status 
when one or more demons are in attendance. In addi-
tion, any "peaceful" gathering of drow and demons has 
the potential to descend into a riot of hedonism, even 
more raw and debased than the orgies drow engage in 
on their own. Stories of such encounters have spread 
all the way to the surface world, where listeners dismiss 
them as exaggerations- but they're not. Draegloths, the 
offspring of drow and glabrezu, serve as proof enough 
that when demons and drow consort with one another, 
the result can be truly horrific. 
YOCHLOLS 
The shape-changing demons known as yochlols are the 
personal servants of Lolth. They seem to be numberless 
in the Demonweb Pits, but where they arise from is un-
known. Are they spawned from drow souls that became 
trapped in Lolth's web? Or do they spring directly from 
the queen herself? Regardless of their origin, yochlols 
respond to the will of Lolth alone. No other demon or 
demon lord can command them. 
Because yochlols can assume the form of a female 
drow or a giant spider, and because they serve Lolth 
without hesitation, all drow assume that some number 
of their friends and neighbors are actually yochlols in 
disguise, spying for Lolth. The higher a drow's standing, 
the more worrisome this prospect becomes. After all, 
Lolth has little reason to care about those at the bottom 
of society, but those who lead her people and direct her 
worship must be closely watched to be sure they remain 
devout, unquestioning, and afraid. 
D ROW RENEGADES 
Drow society is, paradoxically, extremely open-ended 
and extremely oppressive. All drow have a chance, at 
least theoretically, to improve their station in life, and 
movement does occur throughout the hierarchy all the 
time. But, naturally, those in power are determined to 
put down any threat against them- and the penalty for 
insubordination is death. 
As things work out in practice, indentured drow at 
the bottom of the ladder spend their lives laboring for 
another house's gain, and powerful drow at the top of 
society spend their time trying not to be assassinated or 
framed for heresy, while clinging to the power and pres-
tige they've wrested from other houses. 
A dark elf who challenges another for superiority and 
fails, or who fails to respect the hierarchy in some other 
way, has just three options: agonizing death on an altar, 
virtual enslavement, or fleeing for their lives. Some of 
those who choose to run succeed in escaping into the 
Underdark, despite the odds against them. 
Survival for a solitary drow underground is nearly 
impossible. The main routes through the Underdark 
are dotted with drow guard posts, and the back ways 
are prowled by ropers, mind flayers, duergar, and other 
killers. To make matters worse, the renegade's former 
house offers a bounty that entices drow assassins to 
take up the chase. Of those who run, only a small frac-
tion get to the surface. And even that achievement is no 
guarantee of safety, because a lone drow above ground 
is likely to be attacked on sight by surface dwellers.
