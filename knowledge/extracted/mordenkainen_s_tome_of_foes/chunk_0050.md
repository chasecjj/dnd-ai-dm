Those who find a way to survive in the painful world 
of sunlight either live as recluses or find a community 
where their heritage and upbringing give them an ad-
vantage, such as an assassins' guild or a company of 
adventurers. Even in such cases, these traitorous drow 
spend the rest of their lives looking over their shoulders, 
hoping to spy the black hood and flashing blade of a 
bounty-hunting drow assassin before it's too late. 
THE RAVEN QUEEN AND 
THE SHADAR-KAI 
THE RAVEN QUEEN IS TRAPPED BY HER FASCINATION 
with the past. She sits in her fortress, amidst all the memo-
ries of the world, looking at the ones that please her most as 
though they were glittering jewels. Many great wizards have 
attempted to understand her motives, but like a raven she 
has always remained oyptic, keeping her cache of secrets 
just out of their reach. 
-High Lady Alustriel Silverhand 
The Raven Queen is a being of dark mystery. Accom-
plished wizards talk about her in hushed tones, and with 
no small amount of fear, for even they can't say what 
power she wields in her realms, too subtle for mortal 
minds to sense. Rumors abound as to her current form, 
most coming from claims made by lunatics who have de-
scribed an array of disturbing images: a terrible shadow 
that clawed at their innermost thoughts, a pale and 
regal elf who exploded into an untold number of ravens, 
a shambling tangle of slick roots and sticks that over-
whelmed them with dread, or an unknown presence 
that pulled them screaming blindly into the gloom. 
Despite all attempts to demystify her, the Raven 
Queen has remained enigmatic and aloof, immersed in 
a sea of questions. She rules from her Raven Throne 
within the Fortress of Memories, a mazelike castle deep 
within the bleakness of the Shadowfell. From there she 
sends out her ravens to find interesting souls she can 
pluck from various planes of existence. Once they are 
in the Shadowfell, she watches as these souls attempt 
to unravel the mystery of their being-and ultimately go 
mad in the process. 
ORIGIN OF THE RAVEN _ Q,,UEEN 
For those who seek to unravel the enigma of the Raven 
Queen, the story of her origin comes from the ancient 
history of the elves. It is said that she was once an elf 
queen, whose people loved her more than they loved the 
gods. Her true name has been lost to time. 
But from the fragments that have been found of her 
history, it was she who, when Corellon and Lolth were 
locked in conflict, tried to use the souls and magic of 
her people to elevate herself to godly status, thus salvag-
ing the fractured pantheon of the elves. Afterward, the 
legends suggest, she would attempt to implore Corellon 
and Lolth to come to their senses. But the information 
in these fragments was woefully incomplete, and the 
queen's true motives were never fully understood. 
CHAPTER 2 I ELVES 
DESCENT INTO SHADOW 
As the queen rose in power, many elves became inspired 
by her, freely offering their souls and their magical abil-
ities to help her achieve her goal. This group of devoted 
followers called themselves the shadar-kai, and they 
gathered others like themselves around their queen in 
hopes that, once she achieved divinity, she would unify 
all the elves. The queen's plan was to use the souls of 
the shadar-kai to forge a pathway through the Feywild to 
Arvandor, all the while increasing her influence. 
As the numbers of shadar-kai grew, a consortium of 
evil wizards among her followers saw an opportunity to 
siphon off the energy of the shadar-kai for themselves 
by performing their own self-serving ritual, which 
would impart to them magical powers beyond those of 
the greatest elven wizards of legend. But as the queen 
approached the entrance to Arvandor, she realized what 
the wizards were doing and brought all her wrath down 
upon them as the ritual was under way. Because she 
was by now a quasi-divine entity, her supernatural rage 
corrupted the ritual into a phenomenon that took on a 
terrible strength of its own. 
By the time the queen realized her error, she could 
feel the now-twisted magical energy grabbing hold of 
her, and she was powerless to stop it. In a panic, she 
reached out to the souls of the shadar-kai for more 
power, hoping to save herself, but the gravity of the spell 
had become irresistible. It pulled the queen, and all who 
were under her sway, into the Shadowfell, where she 
was instantly killed. From her ruined mind and body, 
the Raven Queen was born. 
THE CREATION OF THE NAGPAS 
When their ritual failed with catastrophic results, the 
wizards in the consortium were pulled into the Shadow-
fell along with the queen and the shadar-kai, but their 
misfortune didn't end there. Their former queen arose 
from the center of a maze of ash and let loose a scream 
of ebon smoke that penetrated the flesh and minds of 
the wizards, turning their bones black and lacerating 
their souls. Their cries of agony merged with her own, 
and when her scream faded, the wizards had been 
mutated and warped into the scabrous, vulturish crea-
tures known as nagpas. Now they wander the planes 
as wretched monsters, marked forever by the Raven 
Queen's curse and banished from her presence. 
AFTER THE FALL 
After the nagpas were created and then banished by the 
Raven Queen, the shadar-kai watched as she fell deeper 
and deeper into a divine madness. Her pain and turmoil 
over the betrayal of her wizards, the destruction of her 
kingdom, and her failure at attaining godhood all con-
