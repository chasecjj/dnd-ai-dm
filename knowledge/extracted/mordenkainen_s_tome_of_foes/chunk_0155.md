DUERGAR SCREkMER 
A duergar screamer is a construct that uses sonic en-
ergy to grind rock into dust. Duergar accused of spread-
ing gossip or plotting against their superiors are trapped 
within one of these devices, their beards shorn and their 
ongoing agony channeled into psionic energy that pow-
ers the screamer. 
DUERGAR SOULBLADE 
Soulblades are duergar warriors whose mastery of 
psionics allows them to manifest blades of psychic en-
ergy to slice apart their foes.

respond by using its Multiattack with its reaction.

Duergar Resilience. The duergar has advantage on saving 
throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist 
being charmed or paralyzed. 
Create Sou/blade. As a bonus action, the duergar can create a 
shortsword-sized, visible blade of psionic energy. The weapon 
appears in the duergar's hand and vanishes if it leaves the duer-
gar's grip, or if the duergar dies or is incapacitated. 
Innate Spellcasting (Psionics). The duergar's innate spellcast-
ing ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell 
attacks). It can innately cast the fo llowing spells, requiring no 
components: 
At will: blade ward, true strike 
3/day each: jump, hunter's mark 
Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the duergar has dis· 
advantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks that rely on sight. 
ACTIONS 
Sou/blade. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 6 (ld6 + 3) force damage, or 10 (2d6 + 3) force 
damage while enlarged. If the soulblade has advantage on the 
attack roll, the attack deals an extra 3 (ld6) force damage. 
Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). For l minute, the 
duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wear· 
ing or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its 
damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the 
attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws 
with advantage. If the duergar lacks the room to become Large, it 
attains the maximum size possible in the space available. 
Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The duergar 
magically turns invisible for up to l hour or until it attacks, it 
casts a spell, it uses its Enlarge, or its concentration is broken 
(as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar 
wears or carries is invisible with it.
