Tu'NARATH 
THEY CALL IT THE CITY OF DEATH. l WOULD MOCK SUCH 
a tired excuse for a name, but if it.fits, who am I to argue? 
-Gimble, gnome bard 
When the githyanki fled from the illithids, Vlaakith led 
them to safety on the Astral Plane inside the floating 
corpse of a six-armed deity. This being's body long ago 
calcified into a great slab of rock, its lower half smashed 
by some ancient disaster. A trail of debris, some of the 
stones larger than a castle, extends from the corpse's 
lower end. 
The city ofTu'narath is built on and in the corpse's up-
per body, with a central district in the area correspond-
ing to its chest and ancillary districts radiating outward 
along its six outstretched arms and toward its head. 
Despite the body's partial destruction, the occasional 
tremor that echoes through its rocky mass suggests that 
some spark of life might still linger deep within. 
Anyone who visits the city does so either at the behest 
of the githyanki or in stealth. Fortunately for those who 
try to enter clandestinely, the place is immense enough 
that a small group can sneak in with relative ease. 
If uninvited visitors arrive openly, they can expect a 
sharp reception from githyanki patrol vessels. If that's 
not enough to bring them to heel, the call goes out for a 
squad of dragon-mounted knights. 
THE STREETS OF Tu'NARATH 
Tu'narath is a jumble of crooked streets that run be-
tween buildings and other structures that are ripped 
Tu' NARATH IN BRIEF 
Here are some key details ofTu'narath. 
Population. Roughly one hundred thousand folk dwell in 
Tu'narath. The vast majority are githyanki, but visitors from 
other planes aren't uncommon. Individuals who come to 
deal with the githyanki reside here. Residents also include 
captives that the githyanki have taken on raids. 
Law and Order. Warriors patrol above the streets in 
astral skiffs to keep the peace. Githyanki who cause un· 
warranted conflict are disciplined, but such punishment is 
rarely lethal. Any visitor who causes a ruckus, however, is 
likely to be slain on the spot, unless Vlaakith has specifi-
cally forbidden such action. 
Inns. Tu'narath has no taverns or inns in the traditional 
sense. The githyanki expect visitors to carve out their own 
accommodations; they can choose from among any num-
ber of abandoned structures. As an alternative, a small 
troupe of renegade modrons maintains a crumbling cita· 
del called the Iron House that has rooms for rent. Visitors 
can pay with interesting trinkets from across the planes. 
Markets. There are no organized markets in Tu'narath. 
The githyanki don't offer goods for sale to visitors, .and 
they don't purchase items offered to them-they simply 
take what they want. 
from the worlds of other planes. Many githyanki raiders 
have a particular obsession for architecture, which they 
satisfy by seizing buildings from the Material Plane and 
other locales and relocating them in Tu'narath. 
Often, these prizes don't remain intact for long. When 
residents become bored or find themselves in the mood 
for debauchery, the githyanki's natural propensity for 
violence manifests in the form of a great brawl or wild 
celebration that causes serious damage to their sur-
roundings. When a structure has served its purpose and 
is no longer useful (or even recognizable), the githyanki 
tear the debris from its resting place and throw it into a 
refuse pile or cast it adrift into the astral sea, to be even-
tually replaced by a new specimen. 
Nonetheless, the city does have a great number of 
permanent structures, and a system of districts in which 
particular functions or activities are concentrated. 
Queen's District. S usurrus, the queen's stronghold, 
is protected by thick, obsidian walls. Only one gate 
leads into it, located on a path that passes beneath the 
statue of Gith. Beyond the statue, the path becomes a 
labyrinthine maze designed to prevent attackers or visi-
tors from gaining access to the queen. Vlaakith's throne 
room, a gargantuan hall supported by obsidian pillars, 
sits at the center of the labyrinth. Guarded by two red 
dragons, Vlaakith sits upon her Throne of Bones and 
holds court over her supplicants. 
Glathk District. A muddy field that extends as far as 
the eye can see is the githyanki equivalent of a labor 
camp. The glathk district, named after the Gith word 
for "farmer"-a term of derision- is where githyanki are 
taken when they violate society's rules. Punishments 
are nonlethal, and often don't involve physical harm. In-
stead, offenders are forced to submit to the mind-numb-
ing sameness of performing one task interminably- a 
fate that, for some, might feel worse than death. For in-
stance, a warrior might be sequestered here after slack-
ing off during weapons practice, sentenced to a prison 
term and charged with moving piles of mud from one 
end of the field to the other. Elsewhere, a squad of war-
riors stands at attention for an indeterminate time, after 
their failure to maintain proper formations during drills. 
Those incarcerated here are rarely supervised closely, 
but knights patrol the area regularly. 
District of Discards. The githyanki dispose of loot 
that they have no use for in a space on the outer surface 
of Tu'narath set aside for the purpose. Such items can 
range from trophies and treasure to prisoners of other 
races that have been set free and left to fend for them-
selves. The few githyanki who dwell here maintain a 
semblance of order amid the wreckage by categorizing 
the castaway items, making it easier for other githyanki 
to locate objects related to their personal interests. 
Creatures seeking to infiltrate Tu'narath have had 
success in using this place as a base, since the warriors 
and knights seldom patrol it, and several groups of freed 
captives- humans, elves, hobgoblins, and other sorts-
make their homes here. 
Military Districts. Soldiers and officers occupy sev-
eral areas around the city, most of which contain defen-
sive works and armories. The githyanki also maintain 
barracks that serve as mustering points in advance of
