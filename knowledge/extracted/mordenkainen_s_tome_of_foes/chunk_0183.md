SKULK 
Skulks are the soulless shells of travelers who became 
lost in the Shadowfell, wandering its gray wastes until 
they lost all sense of self. They are so devoid of identity 
that they have become permanently invisible. Only 
children can see a skulk without the help of a mirror 
or a special candle. On the rare occasions when a 
skulk is visible, it appears as a drab, featureless, hair-
less humanoid. 
Summoned Servants. A skulk can be summoned 
from the Shadowfell by performing a ritual. If the crea-
ture is given a portion of the summoner's identity, the 
skulk is bound to obey the summoner's commands for 
30 days. If a skulk is visible, an astute observer might 
deduce who summoned it, because a skulk assumes a 
vague likeness of its master. 
Cruel and chaotic, skulks carry out their orders in 
the most violent manner possible. A summoned skulk 
can't return to the Shadowfell until it dies, so it has 
every motivation to throw itself into creating bloodshed 
and mayhem. 
Hollow Lives. After killing a person in the material 
world, a skulk sometimes takes up a silent imitation of 
that person's life. In extreme cases, skulks have invaded 
villages, killed all the occupants, and turned the places 
into seeming ghost towns, where flavorless food is pre-
pared daily, colorless clothes are hung up to dry, and 
livestock is shifted from pen to pen until it starves.

Fallible Invisibility. The skulk is invisible. This invisibility can be 
circumvented by three things: 
• The skulk appears as a drab, smooth-skinned humanoid if its e 
reflection can be seen in a mirror or on another surface. 
• The skulk appears as a dim, translucent form in the light of 
a candle made of fat rendered from a corpse whose identity 
is unknown. 
• Humanoid children, aged 10 and under, can see through this 
invisibility. 
Trackless. The skulk leaves no tracks to indicate where it has 
been or where it's headed. 
ACTIONS

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 6 {ld4 + 4) slashing damage. If the skulk has advantage on 
the attack roll, the target also takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

SKULL LORD 
The skull lords have claimed vast regions of the Shad-
owfell as their dominion. From these blighted lands, 
they wage war against their rivals, commanding hordes 
of undead in a bid to establish dominance. Yet skull 
lords always prove to be their own worst enemies; as 
a combined being born from three hateful individuals, 
they constantly plot against themselves. 
Creatures of Betrayal. Infighting and treachery 
brought the skull lords into existence. The first of them 
appeared in the aftermath ofVecna's bid to conquer 
the world of Greyhawk, after the vampire Kas betrayed 
Vecna and took his eye and hand. In the confusion 
resulting from this turn of events, Vecna's warlords 
turned against each other, and the dark one's plans 
were dashed. In a rage, Vecna gathered up his generals 
and captains and bound them in groups of three, fusing 
them into undead abominations cursed to fight among 
themselves for all time. Since the first skull lords were 
exiled into shadow, others have joined them, typically 
after being created from other leaders who betrayed 
their masters. 
Undead Nature. A skull lord doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep.
