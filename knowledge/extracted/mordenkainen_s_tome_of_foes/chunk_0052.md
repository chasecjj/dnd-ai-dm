Many of these daring individuals are adventurers who 
know of the Raven Queen's terrifying power yet never-
theless travel to the Shadowfell to undergo her trial, let-
ting the secrets of their souls be unfolded and revealed. 
The reasons why folk would subject themselves to this 
dangerous experience are numerous, including: 
• To free themselves from a dark and terrible past. It 
is said that the Raven Queen can make you confront 
your fears; some find a way to move beyond them, but 
others can be driven mad. 
• To discover a secret of someone who is dead. Adven-
turers might need to go to the Shadowfell to find a 
soul that has been claimed by the Raven Queen, hop-
ing to unlock its memories. 
• To seek answers that only the Raven Queen might 
know. The Raven Queen's realm contains innumera-
ble memories from all over the multiverse. Desperate 
adventurers might seek her out as a last resort or be 
led to her realm by a series of tempting clues. 
Method or Madness? Some wizards and other schol-
ars have speculated that the Raven Queen is simply 
insane, that there is no method to her madness other 
than a nervous pecking apart of a psyche with no more 
motive than a curious child pulling the legs off an ant. 
Others have speculated that the Raven Queen needs the 
gravity of emotions to hold her eternally decaying iden-
tity together. But a few sages have postulated that the 
Raven Queen's purpose is of greater importance, that 
she serves as a filter of sorts, cleansing souls that cling 
to fear and pain, forcing them to confront their unfin-
ished business so that they are freed of their mortal bag-
gage and can rise to explore higher planes of existence. 
THE RAVEN QUEEN'S INFLUENCE 
The Raven Queen's desire to interfere with the affairs of 
the gods and her subsequent failure was taken as noth-
ing less than treason by both Corellon and Lolth. As a 
result, the physical reality of her kingdom was shifted 
to the Shadowfell, and the memory of her existence 
was wiped from the minds of elves. Initially, no mortals 
knew of her, but over the centuries, those who have jour-
neyed to the Shadowfell and those who have encoun-
VECNA
1S OBSESSION 
One evil mind is fixated on wresting away the Raven 
Queen's power: the archlich Vecna. Vecna has long coveted 
her ability over knowledge and souls; to steal souls would 
give him the ability to amass an army of the dead large 
enough to conquer the Shadowfell and turn it into his own 
kingdom of death. There he would rule from the Fortress 
of Memories, and through the Raven Queen's power have 
access to all the lost knowledge stored within the souls 
she has trapped over the millennia. But to this day, all his 
attempts to gain a foothold there have been thwarted. 
Because of his obsession with usurping the Raven 
Queen, and claiming the Fortress of Memories, Vecna 
has embroiled himself in a terrible conflict, leading his 
armies into relentless battles against the Raven Queen 
and her shadar-kai fanatics and against the vampire lord 
Kas, Vecna's former lieutenant, whom Vecna wants to see 
destroyed over all other enemies. Some say this war is just 
another of the Raven Queen's beloved tragedies playing 
out for her amusement. 
CHAPTER 2 
ELVES 
tered shadar-kai in the world have seen, or heard tales 
of, a dark fortress, a mysterious figure surrounded by 
gaunt servants, and scores of seemingly sentient ravens. 
Most folk who have heard of the Raven Queen view her 
through a lens of superstitious fear, attributing to her 
all kinds of strange occurrences, mishaps, and coinci-
dences. But those who seriously study the arcane- war-
locks, wizards, sorcerers, and the like- know that her 
effect on the world is farther-reaching than that. 
Audience after Death. Some adventurers claim 
to have been visited by the Raven Queen after their 
deaths- before their stalwart friends paid to have them 
resurrected. While they were in the afterlife, the Raven 
Queen enlisted them for a quest to complete a task, ac-
quire a particular item, or perhaps to travel to a location 
and simply wait. Most of those who have talked about 
these visitations say they felt compelled to do her bid-
ding, because the visions imparted by the Raven Queen 
made it apparent that the quest was in some way part of 
their greater purpose. 
The Raven Queen's reason for communing in this way 
is a matter of some dispute. Some sages posit that she is 
using people as pawns in an inscrutable game, the rules 
of which are known only to her and the Lady of Pain. 
Others suggest that she is balancing the multiverse by 
having mortals complete various tasks, and some say 
that it is in these moments of obeisance to her that the 
Raven Queen recalls a fragment of her former self. 
SERVANTS OF THE QUEEN 
The shadar-kai are bound to the Raven Queen, cursed to 
forever serve her in the Shadowfell. They dwell in places 
outside the Fortress of Memories, usually too terrified of 
the place to enter it willingly. In their communities they 
reenact their old rituals and ceremonies, in a pale imita-
tion of the days when they dwelled in the life and light of 
their now-lost kingdom. 
When shadar-kai are in the Shadowfell, their bodies 
and faces are old and withered, displaying the full ef-
fects of the terrible magic that stripped them of their for-
mer elven beauty. To hide their visages, they often wear 
masks made of metal or wood, but even these coverings 
are melancholic in appearance. When shadar-kai are 
sent away from the Shadowfell to do the Raven Queen's 
bidding, they take on youthful features similar to those 
of other elves, although their skin remains deathly pale. 
Immortal S ervants. The shadar-kai know that when 
they die, the Raven Queen captures their souls and 
returns them to the Shadowfell, where they are resur-
rected to serve her yet again. Thus, they consider death 
to be a temporary condition, and many shadar-kai care 
little for the physical shell they currently inhabit. 
Shadar-kai know that those who come willingly to the 
Raven Queen's tower are there to beseech her for some-
thing, and thus they try to prepare such visitors for what 
they will face. The queen's servants talk to any inquiring 
adventurer about the gravity of emotion, how sorrow 
weighs on the soul as it travels through the Shadowfell, 
and how best to persevere in the Raven Queen's test. 
Follow the Ravens. When the Raven Queen sees a 
soul or a piece of information she wants, she sends her 
ravens to alert the shadar-kai. Her minions then put
