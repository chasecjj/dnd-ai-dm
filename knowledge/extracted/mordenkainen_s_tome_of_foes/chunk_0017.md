D EVIL PERSONALITY TRAITS 
d6 
Trait 
I always have a scheme to make a profit. 
2 
Nobody is as smart as me, and I need to prove that 
all the time. 
3 
There's a rule for everything. 
4 
If I can't seize control, I'll serve in the meantime. 
S 
I'm a bully who backs down when faced with any sort 
of resistance. 
6 
Every problem can be solved with the use of force. 
DEVIL I DEALS 
d6 
Ideal 
loyalty. I keep my vows to my superior and respect 
those who do the same. 
2 
Law. I might not like the rules, but I obey them. 
3 
Ambition. The need to improve my station drives my 
every action. 
4 
Conquest. I am equal to the sum of the foes I have 
defeated in combat. 
S 
Cunning. Those who can see an advantage in the dir-
est situation deserve respect. 
6 
Brutality. Overwhelming violence, and those who can 
deliver it, are worthy of obedience. 
D EVIL BONDS 
d6 
Bond 
I and my comrades fought well in the Blood War, and 
our service demands respect.

Rules make us what we are.

their prosperity.

One day I will have revenge on those who defied me. 
S 
If I do my duty, in time I will be rewarded.

Flaw 
2 
3 
4 
s 
6 
My frustration boils over into violence. 
I obey the law, but I strain at its limits to the point of 
heresy. 
I put the minimum effort possible into anything that 
isn't my own idea. 
A low profile is the best defense of all. 
I'm so reliant on the laws of the Nine Hells that I 
panic without their guidance. 
I am secretly jealous of the freedom that mortals 
enjoy.
