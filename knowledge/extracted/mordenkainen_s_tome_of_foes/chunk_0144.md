H UTIJIN 
Politics in the Nine Hells are anything but predictable. 
Alliances form all the time, but most wind up unraveling 
due to treachery. Nevertheless, for all their backbiting 
and betrayal, the devils do occasionally display loyalty, 
offering unwavering service to their masters. One such 
example is Hutijin, a duke of Cania and loyal servant of 
Mephistopheles. 
Across the Hells, Hutijin's name fills lesser devils 
with fear and loathing, for this duke commands two 
companies of pit fiends, which make up Cania's aristoc-
racy. With such soldiers under his command, Hutijin 
can easily crush any rival who gets in his way, while 
also providing Mephistopheles with security against 
armies that might seek to contest his dominion. Hutijin 
has amassed enough power to challenge the lord of 
Cania, but he has never wavered in his support for his 
master-suggesting, perhaps, that Mephistopheles has 
some hold over him.

' 
Outside the Nine Hells, Hutijin is a relatively obscure 
figure, known only to the most learned infernal schol-
ars. He has no cults of his own, and his servants are few 
in number. The reason is simple: Hutijin hates mortals. 
When summoned from the Hells, he repays the instiga-
tor with a long and agonizing death. 
Mephistopheles forbids Hutijin from making too many 
forays into the Material Plane, since the duke's absence 
leaves him vulnerable to his rivals. Other archdevils 
know how much Hutijin despises mortals and have 
secretly disseminated the means to call him from the 
Nine Hells in the hope of distracting the archdevil long 
enough for them to assail Mephistopheles. Hutijin sends 
devils into the Material Plane to eradicate mention of 
his name and destroy those who have learned of him, 
but the summonings still occur. When called from his 
post, he negotiates as quickly as he can, usually closing 
a deal with little cost to the summoner. However, once 
the deal has been struck, Hutijin repays the interruption 
with death.
