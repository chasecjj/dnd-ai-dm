BAEL 
With the Blood War raging for eons and no end in sight, 
opportunities abound for ambitious archdevils to win 
fame, glory, and power in the ongoing struggle against 
the demons. Duke Bae!, one of Mammon's most import-
ant vassals, has won fame and acclaim for his victories. 
Charged with leading sixty-six companies of barbed 
devils, Bae! has proven to be a tactical genius, earning 
esteem for himself and his master as a result of victory 
after victory over the abyssal host. Mammon relies on 
Bae!, because of his battle acumen, to safeguard his 
holdings. Mammon has never been ousted during a time 
when so many other archdevils have lost their positions, 
which is a testament to Bael's skill on the battlefield. 
For his accomplishments, as well as for the hue of his 
skin, Baal has been granted the title of Bronze General. 
His accolades notwithstanding, Bae! has had a difficult 
time navigating the quagmire of infernal politics. His 
critics call him naive, though never to his face. His pri-
mary interest has always been leading soldiers in battle, 
so he finds it frustrating to have his ambitions of ascend-
ing to a higher rank constantly stymied by politically 
shrewd rivals. 
Bae! prefers to make servants out of his adversaries, 
and mortals bound to his service earn their wretched 
place by falling victim to Bael's superior stratagems. 
Bae! gladly spares the lives of those he defeats, but only 
if they pledge their souls and service to him. Although 
he is willing to corrupt almost any being in this way, he 
always destroys any demons he defeats. 
Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if they 
can provide him with an advantage in his own politick-
ing. He recruits savvy individuals and relies on them to 
represent his interests at Mammon's court, which leaves 
Bae! free to pursue his battle lust. 
Despite his lack of interest in affairs outside battle, or 
perhaps because of it, Bae! has gained a small following 
of cultists. Those who worship at his altar call him the 
King of Hell, and the most deluded believe that he is 
the lord of all devils. In arcane circles, certain writings, 
such as the dreaded Book of Fire, say that Bae! revealed 
the invisibility spell to the world, though some scholars 
of magic hotly refute such claims. Bae! is sometimes de-
picted as a toad, a cat, a male human, or some combina-
tion of these forms, though none of these images reflect 
his true appearance.

GE RYON 
Geryon is locked in an endless struggle with Levistus 
for control of Stygia. The two have fought each other 
for centuries, each displacing the other innumerable 
times. Currently, Geryon occupies an odd position in the 
infernal hierarchy. Although Levistus still claims lord-
ship over Stygia, he has been trapped in an enormous 
block of ice at the command of Asmodeus. For his part, 
Geryon marshals his followers and seeks to discover the 
means to replace his hated rival. 
Among the archdevils, Geryon and Zariel are espe-
cially known for martial prowess. He is a ferocious 
hunter and a relentless tracker. Other devils command 
legions and bid their followers to battle their enemies. 
Geryon loves the feeling of flesh and steel being sun-
dered beneath his claws, and the taste of his foes' blood. 
His ferocity serves him well in Stygia's frozen waste, 
but it has also limited his ability to collect souls and 
forge an effective hierarchy. Sages who study the Nine 
Hells believe that the battle for control of Stygia is a 
test staged by Asmodeus in hopes of purging the worst 
impulses from both Geryon and Levistus, or at the very 
least opening the door for a competent replacement for 
both to rise from the ranks. 
CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
GERYON'S LAIR 
Geryon has recently reclaimed his ancient fortress, 
Coldsteel, a sprawling complex that rises from the 
ice and snow at the center of Stygia. He roams the 
passages of this place, scattering the ice devils and 
minotaur slaves he took from Baphomet, raging against 
Asmodeus's betrayal while spitting oaths of vengeance 
and hatching mad schemes to reclaim his standing 
from Levistus. 
Lair Actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initia-
tive ties), Geryon can take a lair action to cause one of 
the following effects; he can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row: 
• Geryon causes a blast of cold to burst from the ground 
at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. The cold 
fills a cube, 10 feet on each side, centered on that 
point. Each creature in that area must succeed on 
a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (8d6) 
cold damage. 
• Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet 
of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom 
saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. The 
target can end the effect on itself if it deals any dam-
age to one or more of its allies. 
• Geryon casts the banishment spell.
