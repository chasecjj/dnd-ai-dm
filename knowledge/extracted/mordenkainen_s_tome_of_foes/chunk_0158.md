Incorporeal Movement. The eidolon can move through other 
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 
5 (ldlO) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object other 
than a sacred statue. 
Sacred Animation (Recharge 5-6). When the eidolon moves 
into a space occupied by a sacred statue, the eidolon can disap-
pear, causing the statue to become a creature under the eido-
lon's control. The eidolon uses the sacred statue's statistics in 
place of its own. 
Turn Resistance. The eidolon has advantage on saving throws 
against any effect that turns undead. 
ACTIONS 
Divine Dread. Each creature within 60 feet of the eidolon that 
can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
be frightened of it for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, 
the creature must take the Dash action and move away from 
the eidolon by the safest available route at the start of each of 
its turns, unless there is nowhere for it to move, in which case 
the creature also becomes stunned until it can move again. A 
frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each 
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's 
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is 
immune to any eidolon's Divine Dread for the next 24 hours.

False Appearance. While the statue remains motionless, it is 
indistinguishable from a normal statue. 
Ghostly Inhabitant. The eidolon that enters the sacred statue 
remains inside it until the statue drops to 0 hit points, the ei-
dolon uses a bonus action to move out of the statue, or the ei-
dolon is turned or forced out by an effect such as the dispel evil 
and good spell. When the eidolon leaves the statue, it appears 
in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the statue. 
Inert. When not inhabited by an eidolon, the statue is 
an object. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The statue makes two slam attacks. 
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. 
Hit: 43 (6dl2 + 4) bludgeoning damage. 
Rock. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 60 ft./240 ft., one 
target. Hit: 37 (6dl0 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
