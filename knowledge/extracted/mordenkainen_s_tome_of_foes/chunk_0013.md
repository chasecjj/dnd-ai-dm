join the cause of Mephistopheles sees that invitation as 
proof of one's ascension to greatness. 
The downside to this arrangement is the true nature 
of Mephistopheles, which is apparent only after a new 
contract is signed. He can be charming when he re-
cruits a soul directly, and his agents are careful to avoid 
making any promises about his actions or attitudes. But 
once a soul arrives in the Nine Hells to serve him, it in-
variably faces decades of routine work or tedious study. 
Thus, few who join his stable of arcanists remain 
happy with their decision, but they would be well ad-
vised not to show any discontent. Mephistopheles fills 
his contracts with cleverly worded clauses that allow 
him to annihilate any of his servants with a word. As 
further protection against dissent, he isolates his min-
ions, allowing them to gather in small groups only when 
needed to carry on their work. Even then, the law of Me-
phistopheles prohibits all but the most vital communi-
cation, limited to why they have come together. Some of 
the most skilled but most gullible former wizards of the 
Material Plane now toil eternally in Cania, alone except 
for their books, their tools, and their regrets. 
STOREHOUSES OF LORE 
Libraries and other places where arcane knowledge 
is recorded or contained are scattered across Cania, 
mainly to ensure that a single disastrous experiment at 
one location can't destroy the evidence of all the work 
conducted at other sites. In his pursuit of ever more lore, 
Mephistopheles combines his prodigious intellect with 
his obsessive nature. This combination of traits enables 
him to delve far more deeply into a topic than most or-
dinary wizards can even conceive of. Even the tiniest of 
trivialities is fascinating to him. 
Sometimes, however, the business of the Nine Hells 
forces him to relinquish direct oversight of a project. 
When he returns to his research, a new mystery might 
capture his fancy, while the older project continues to 
move forward without his oversight or interference. 
Here and there, tucked away in Cania's terrible 
environment and similarly buried in the immense 
bureaucracy of the Hells, stand long-isolated citadels 
occupied by sages and spellcasters toiling away at some 
seemingly forgotten endeavor. The supervisors of these 
projects might have achieved incredible results that they 
patiently wait to share with Mephistopheles the next 
time his attention points in their direction. 
THE RANK AND FILE 
While the Lords of the Nine set the overall direction of 
the Hells, it is the rank and file- uncounted numbers of 
lesser devils- that drive their schemes forward. Den-
izens of the Material Plane deal primarily with devils 
from the lower tiers of the hierarchy. 
ALL CREATURES IN THEIR PLACES 
Status is all-important to devils. Every devil knows its 
place in the hierarchy, and each devil has a unique name 
to ensure that no cases of mistaken identity occur when 
a devil is called to account for its actions. 
A devil's form usually corresponds to its status, but 
circumstances can allow for variations. A pit fiend, for 
instance, might take the form of an imp in order to per-
sonally infiltrate a kingdom on the Material Plane. 
The hierarchy of the Nine Hells has thirteen tiers or 
ranks. A devil of a higher rank can potentially compel 
those beneath it to obey its orders, but it must still abide 
by the law when exercising its authority. In most cases, 
a devil can demand the obedience of another devil only 
if both are in the hierarchy of the same archdevil. For 
example, a devil in service to Dispater can't command a 
lower-ranked devil among the forces of Levistus. 
Lowest of the Low. At the bottom of the hierarchy are 
lemures and nupperibos, creatures that qualify as devils 
only by the most generous of definitions. Although they 
are individually worthless, they constitute an effective 
fighting force when gathered into a teeming horde that 
Roods the battlefield. 
Lesser Devils. The next six higher tiers are occupied 
by the lesser devils: imps (rank 2), spined devils (rank 
3), bearded devils and merregons (rank 4), barbed devils 
(rank 5), chain devils (rank 6), and bone devils (rank 7). 
These devils are specialists, typically assigned to tasks 
that best suit their capabilities. Imps are used as spies 
and messengers rather than combatants , and they are 
the infernal agents most often encountered on the Mate-
rial Plane. Lesser devils rarely command other devils, 
aside from specific, short-term assignments for which 
they are invested with authority. 
Greater Devils. Grouped in the four tiers above the 
lesser devils are the greater devils: horned devils and or-
thons (rank 8), erinyes (rank 9), ice devils and narzugons 
(rank 10), and amnizus and pit fiends (rank 11). Lesser 
devils deal with these leaders on a daily basis. Ice devils 
are combat commanders, equivalent to captains and col-
onels, while pit fiends are the Hells' generals and nobles. 
Archdevils. The mightiest devils of all are the unique 
and uniquely powerful archdevils. Those who don't 
presently serve as lord of a layer hold the title of Duke or 
Duchess (rank 12). Atop the hierarchy at rank 13 stand 
the Lords of the Nine, arrayed from topmost layer to bot-
tommost, with Asmodeus holding sway over all. 
RULES FOR EVERYTHING 
Devils are evil schemers by nature, but they must oper-
ate within the bounds of the Nine Hells' intricate legal 
code. A devil's attitude toward the law is in part driven 
by its personal attitude and situation. 
For instance, devils that fight in the Blood War rely 
on military regulations and their officers' directions to 
dictate their actions. They obey orders without question, 
and take part in drills when off duty to ensure that they 
act to the exact parameters of their instructions. 
Some other devils, particularly those of higher ranks 
and those tasked with infiltrating the Material Plane, 
see the law as a puzzle to be decoded or an obstacle to 
be circumvented. For instance, a devil might be bound 
by law never to withhold aid from its commander except 
under rare and specific circumstances. A clever upstart 
that wants to annihilate its superior could manipulate 
events to bring about one such circumstance, then look 
on as the commander succumbs while it cites the law 
that "prevents" it from offering help.
