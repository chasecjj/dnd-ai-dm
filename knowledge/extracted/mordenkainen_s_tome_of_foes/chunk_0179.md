OGRE CHAIN BRUTE 
An ogre chain brute wields a great spiked 
chain. It swings this chain with both 
hands in a wide circle around itself to 
knock foes off their feet. Alternatively, it 
can swing the chain in a crushing over-
head smash that's nearly impossible to 
block or deflect. 
OGRE HOWDAH 
The most unusual of the specialized 
ogres, the howdah carries a palisaded 
wooden fort on its back. The fort is big 
enough to serve as a fighting platform for 
up to four small humanoids. Ogre how-
dahs are most often seen bearing goblins 
equipped with bows and spears into bat-
tle, but they could just as easily transport 
kobolds, deep gnomes, or other human-
oids of similar size.

RETRIEVER 
The retriever is a potent, spider-like construct 
conceived and built by the drow for one original 
purpose- to prowl the Abyss and capture demons 
for the drow to enslave or use in their rituals. The 
automatons proved so effective and so fearsome 
that they now perform many different missions. 
Demon-Infused. Although each retriever is 
a metal-and-magic construct, it houses the im-
prisoned spirit of a bebilith. Most of the demon's 
intellect has been distilled away, leaving only its 
cruelty and cunning. 
Lethal Collectors. Though they were created 
to operate only in the Abyss, retrievers are some-
times dispatched when a powerful drow needs 
some creature or object captured and brought 
back alive and intact. Only under the rarest of 
circumstances is a retriever handed over or sold 
to a non-drow, since the dark elves don't want to 
take the chance that the construct will be turned 
against them.

Faultless Tracker. The retriever is given a quarry by its master. 
The quarry can be a specific creature or object the master is 
personally acquainted with, or it can be a general type of crea-
ture or object the master has seen before. The retriever knows 
the direction and distance to its quarry as long as the two of 
them are on the same plane of existence. The retriever can have 
C HAPTeR 6 I BESTIARY 
only one such quarry at a time. The retriever also always knows 
the location of its master. 
Innate Spel/casting. The retriever's innate spellcasting ability is 
Wisdom (spell save DC 13). The retriever can innately cast the 
following spells, requiring no material components. 
3/day each: plane shift (only self and up to one incapacitated 
creature, which is considered willing for the spell), web 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The retriever makes two foreleg attacks and uses 
its force or paralyzing beam once, if available. 
Foreleg. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one tar-
get. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage. 
Force Beam. The retriever targets one creature it can see within 
60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 27 (5d10) force damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. 
Paralyzing Beam (Recharge 5-6). The retriever targets one 
creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must suc· 
ceed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 
l minute. The paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on 
a success. 
If the paralyzed creature is Medium or smaller, the retriever 
can pick it up as part of the retriever's move and walk or climb 
with it at full speed.
