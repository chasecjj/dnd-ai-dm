DEVILS: ARCHDEVILS 
At the top of the hierarchy of the Nine Hells stand the 
archdevils, a vicious and backbiting group made up of 
the Hells' elite devils. They include the various lords, 
the nobles who owe them fealty, and some exiles and 
outcasts who have fallen out of favor. Favor in the Nine 
Hells shifts like the wind, and the fortunes of the great 
and mighty rise and fall at the whims of their betters. 
Many dread names are included in the rolls of the arch-
devils; the few described here are among those that 
adventurers are most likely to encounter. 
Wish Fulfillment. All devils seek control over mortal 
souls, so they offer enticements to tempt mortals into 
making unwise bargains. Archdevils, possessing the 
true power of the Nine Hells, can fulfill nearly any de-
sire (within the limits of a wish spell) requested by the 
mortals they bind to their infernal contracts. Archdevils 
always fulfill the letter of the wish, rewarding desperate 
mortals with a twisted interpretation of their desires. 
In exchange for this gift, the devil expects and receives 
total power over a soul and usually claims it upon the 
mortal's death. An archdevil can't fulfill its own wish.
