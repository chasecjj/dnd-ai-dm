A merrenoloth can hold its own in a fight, but it prefers 
to avoid combat when possible. In fact, it typically speci-
fies in its contracts that it is under no obligation to fight. 
A merrenoloth's first duty is always to its vessel. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
Any ship a merrenoloth is contracted to captain be-
comes the creature's lair. When fighting on the ship, 
the merrenoloth can invoke its ability to take lair ac-
tions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the 
merrenoloth can take one lair action to cause one of 
the following effects; it can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row: 
• The ship regains 22 (4dl0) hit points. 
• A strong wind propels the ship, increasing its speed by 
30 feet until initiative count 20 on the next round. 
• The air within 60 feet of the ship is filled with howling 
wind. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that 
area is difficult terrain, and when a Medium or smaller 
creature flies into that area or starts its turn flying 
there. it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving 
throw or be knocked prone. 
R EGIONAL E FFECTS 
A merrenoloth imbues its vessel with powerful magic 
that creates one or more of the following effects: 
• The ship doesn't sink even if its hull is breached. 
• The ship always stays on course to the destination the 
merrenoloth names. 
• Creatures the merrenoloth chooses to take on the ship 
aren't discomfited by wind or weather, though this 
effect doesn't protect against damage. 
If the merrenoloth dies. these effects fade over the 
course of ld6 hours .
