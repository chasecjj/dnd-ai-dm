HOWLER 
A far-off wail precedes the sight of a howler. Even at a 
distance, one's mind cringes at the sound and fills with 
horror at the realization that the noise is drawing closer. 
When howlers go on the prowl, courage isn't enough to 
stand up against them, and even one's sanity is at risk. 
Prowlers from Pandemonium. These nightmare 
creatures, native to Pandemonium, can also be found 
on most of the Lower Planes, because of the many 
fiends that capture them and train them as war hounds. 
Howlers can be domesticated, after a fashion, but they 
respond only to brutal training during which they are 
forced to recognize the trainer as the pack's undisputed 
leader. A trained pack then follows its leader without 
hesitation. Howler packs course over the battlefields of 
the Blood War and also serve evil mortals who have the 
power and the savagery to command their loyalty. 
Brutal Hunters. Howlers rely on speed, numbers, and 
their mind-numbing howl to corner prey before they tear 
it apart. The howl floods the minds of its victims, mak-
ing complex thought impossible. They can do little more 
than stare in horror and stumble around the battlefield 
in a search for safety. Any task more demanding than 
that is beyond their capability. Fiends especially prize 
howlers for this reason, because for a few crucial mo-
ments in a battle, their howls can neutralize an enemy's 
ability to use spells and other powers.

Multiattack. The howler makes two bite attacks. 
Rending Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., 
one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, plus 22 (4dl0) 
psychic damage if the target is frightened. This attack ignores 
damage resistance. 
Mind-Breaking Howl (Recharge 6). The howler emits a keening 
howl in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area that isn't 
deafened must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or 
be frightened until the end of the howler's next turn. While a 
creature is frightened in this way, its speed is halved, and it is 
incapacitated. A target that successfully saves is immune to the 
Mind-Breaking Howl of all howlers for the next 24 hours.

KRUTHIKS 
Kruthiks are chitin-covered reptiles that hunt in packs 
and nest in sprawling subterranean warrens. They 
are attracted to sources of heat, such as dwarven 
forges and pools of molten lava, and carve out lairs 
as close to such locations as possible. As they 
burrow through the earth, they leave behind 
tunnels- evidence that is often the first clue to 
the nearby presence of a kruthik hive. Kruthiks 
also make use of preexisting underground 
chambers, incorporating them into their lairs 
when they can. 
Kruthiks communicate with one another 
through a series of hisses and chittering 
noises. These sounds can often be heard 
in advance of a kruthik attack. Whenever 
their lair is invaded, kruthik guards send 
out an alarm by rapidly tapping the stone floor with their 
sharp legs. 
Sharp Senses. In addition to having an acute sense 
of smell, kruthiks can see in the dark and can detect 
vibrations in the earth around them. They take the scent 
of their own dead as a warning and avoid areas where 
many other kruthiks have died. Slaying a sufficient num-
ber of kruthiks in one area might cause the remaining 
hive members to move elsewhere. 
Sharper Weapons. Although they can feed on car-
rion, kruthiks prefer live prey. They kill enemies by 
impaling them on their spiked limbs, then grind up the 
flesh and bones with mandibles strong enough to chew 
rock. When several kruthiks gang up on a single foe, 
they become frenzied and even more lethal. 
Shared Lair. Kruthiks abide the presence of con-
structs, elementals, oozes, and undead, and use such 
creatures to help guard their hive. Kruthiks are smart 
enough to barricade some tunnels and dig new ones 
that keep their neighbors away from their eggs. 
Kruthiks hatch from eggs laid by female adults. Each 
egg is about the size of an adult human's head and 
hatches within a month. Tiny kruthik hatchlings are 
harmless, rarely stray far from the nest, and feed pri-
mari ly on offal and one another. Within a month, the 
survivors become young kruthiks large enough to hunt 
and defend themselves.
