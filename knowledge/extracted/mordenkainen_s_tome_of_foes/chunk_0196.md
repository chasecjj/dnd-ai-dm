CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
RoTTROLL 
A troll that is infused with waves of necrotic energy as 
it regenerates can develop a symbiotic relations hip with 
that deathly power. The troll's body withers, and its flesh 
falls away from the body as quickly as it forms. Eventu-
ally a rot troll becomes unable to regenerate, though it 
still heals normally. The creature courses with necrotic 
energy that flows out of its withered form. Simply stand-
ing near a rot troll exposes other creatures to its lethal 
emanations. 
SPIRIT TROLL 
A troll blasted with psychic energy can take a nonphys-
ical form when it regenerates. Its psyche survives, but 
the body of a spirit troll is as insubstantial as shadow. 
The troll might be unaware of the transition- it still 
moves and attacks with teeth and claws as it always 
did- but now it strikes at its victim's mind.
