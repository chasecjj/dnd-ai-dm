Yondalla created the first halfling villages and showed 
the people how to build, plant, and harvest. She knew 
that the bounty of a halfling village would be tempting 
plunder for any brigand or monster, so she used her 
powers to conceal their homes from easy discovery, 
blending them into the landscape so that most travelers 
would pass by without a second glance. 
To the halflings, Yondalla is responsible for the spring 
in their step and the bubbly excitement they feel from 
knowing that luck is on their side. When a pumpkin 
grows to enormous size or a garden yields twice as 
many carrots as usual, credit goes to Yondalla. When a 
halfting trips, slides down a hillside, and lands on a nug-
get of gold, that's Yondalla turning bad luck into good. 
ARVOREEN 
From time to time, halflings must fight to defend their 
friends or their village. In those moments, the tales of 
Arvoreen come to the fore in every halfling's memory. 
Every youth hears over and over again the stories of the 
hero's bravery and cunning, his clever tactics in battle, 
and his ability to use speed and smallness to defeat a 
much larger foe. The elders know that the world outside 
is dangerous and that their kin must understand how to 
deal with those dangers. Stories about Arvoreen are told 
in such a way that youngsters are inspired to act out his 
epic battles. In this way, the halflings get practical expe-
rience in executing measures that are designed to help 
the halflings defeat kobolds and goblin raiders, or even 
take down an ogre. When the time comes to put those 
tactics to use in earnest, everyone will be ready. 
Cooperation is a fundamental principle in how half-
lings fend off their enemies. Every community practices 
its own version of Arvoreen's favored tactics: 
Scatterstrike. The halfiings run in every direction as 
if in a panic, but then they regroup and circle back to 
attack with a concentrated effort. 
Turtle Shell. Halflings cluster together and cover each 
other with shields, washtubs, wheelbarrows, coffer 
lids, or anything else that can deflect a blow. 
Troll Knocker. A few halflings act as bait to lure a troll 
or other large creature into a clearing where the rest 
of the group can hurl stones at it from concealment to 
confuse the monster, persuading it to seek other prey. 
Swarming Stickwhackers. Halflings rush an intruder 
in waves, swatting the enemy with sticks on all sides. 
Fiddle and Crack. A halfling fiddler lures the monster 
into a trap, usually a net or a pit, followed by several 
burly halflings wielding large sticks and hitting the 
monster from a safe vantage. 
SHEELA PERYROYL 
Every halfling village sets aside a place for paying 
respects to Sheela Peryroyl. In a grove of trees, a rasp-
berry patch, or a swath of wildflowers, villagers leave a 
small offering whenever they walk by, or tip their caps, 
or whisper a blessing in her honor. A village counts itself 
lucky if this place is cared for by~ druid. Creat~res t.hat 
attack a village under the protection of the gods druids 
soon learn the error of their ways when all manner of 
plants lash out to grapple and sting the intruders, as 
though nature herself were aiding the halflings' cause. 
On nights when the moon is full, especially during the 
planting and harvesting seasons, the elders tell stories 
about Sheela Peryroyl. After becoming a hero though 
her glorious adventures, Sheela joined with the earth, 
fusing her spirit with the flowers, plants, and trees so 
she could better provide for her kin. A halfting who acci-
dentally steps on a flower often says, "Begging your par-
don, Sheela." Before halflings cut down a tree to use its 
wood for a new house, it is customary for them to stand 
before the tree with their caps doffed, humbly asking 
permission from Sheela to continue. 
CHARMALAINE 
Charmalaine is an energetic and spontaneous deity, 
unafraid of danger, for she expects to be able to detect it 
as it approaches and evade it before it brings her harm. 
The stories of her accomplishments read like an adven-
turer's wildest dreams: she escaped from an army of 
sahuagin, solved the Chamber of a Thousand Traps, and 
took treasure from the lair ofTiamat. Halflings envision 
her as a young adult who moves so fast that her boots 
smoke and sometimes even catch fire. She carries a 
mace that has a head that shouts out warnings, and she 
is accompanied by her ferret friend, Xaphan. 
Halflings sometimes call Charmalaine the Lucky 
Ghost because she can send her spirit out of her body to 
scout ahead, and thus she is able to warn halfling ad~en ­
turers of danger while in her incorporeal form. Halfhngs 
who favor Charmalaine are usually adventurers or those 
who pursue other risky professions such as hunting, 
beast training, scouting, and guarding public officials.
