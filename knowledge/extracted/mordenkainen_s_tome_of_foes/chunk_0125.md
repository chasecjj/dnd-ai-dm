LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), 
Demogorgon can take a lair action to cause one of 
the following effects; he can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row: 
• Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, 
which appears in his own space and lasts until initia-
tive count 20 of the next round. On his turn, Demogor-
gon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal 
to his walking speed (no action required). The first 
time a creature or object interacts physically with De-
mogorgon (for example, by hitting him with an attack), 
there is a 50 percent chance that the illusory duplicate 
is being affected, not Demogorgon himself, in which 
case the illusion disappears. 
• Demogorgon casts the darkness spell four times at 
its lowest level, targeting different areas with the 
spell. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on 
the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the 
next round. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing Demogorgon's lair is warped by 
his magic, creating one or more of the following effects: 
• The area within 6 miles of the lair becomes overpop-
ulated with lizards, poisonous snakes, and other ven-
omous beasts. 
• Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become violent and 
crazed- even creatures that are normally docile. 
• If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile 
of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 
Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness 
determined by the Madness of Demogorgon table. A 
creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be 
affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours. 
If Demogorgon dies, these effects fade over the course 
of ldlO days. 
M ADNESS OF D EMOGORGON 
If a creature goes mad in Demogorgon's lair or within 
line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of 
Demogorgon table to determine the nature of the mad-
ness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. 
See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more on madness.

FRAZ- URB
1LUU -----
All demons are liars, but Fraz-Urb'luu is the Prince of 
Deception and Demon Lord of Illusions. He uses every 
trick, every ounce of demonic cunning, to manipulate 
his enemies- mortal and fiend alike- to do his will. 
Fraz-Urb'luu can create dreamlands and mind-bending 
fantasies able to deceive the most discerning foes. 
Once imprisoned for centuries below Castle Grey-
hawk on the world of Oerth, Fraz-Urb'luu has slowly 
rebuilt his power in the Abyss. He seeks the pieces of 
the legendary staff of power taken from him by those 
who imprisoned him, and commands his servants to 
do likewise. 
The Prince of Deception's true form is like that of a 
great gargoyle, some 12 feet tall, with an extended, mus-
cular neck and a smiling face framed by long, pointed 
ears and lank, dark hair, and bat-like wings are furled 
against his powerful shoulders. He can assume other 
forms, however, from the hideous to the beautiful. Often 
the demon lord becomes so immersed in playing a role 
that he loses himself in it for a time. 
Many of the cultists of Fraz-Urb'luu aren't even aware 
they serve the Prince of Deception, believing their 
master is a beneficent being and granter of wishes, 
some lost god or celestial, or even another fiend. Fraz-
Urb'luu wears all these masks and more. He particularly 
delights in aiding demon-hunters against his demonic

reveal his true nature and claim their souls as his own. 
FRAZ-URB'Luu's LAIR 
Fraz-Urb'luu's lair lies within the abyssal realm of Hol-
low's Heart, a featureless plain of white dust with few 
structures on it. The lair itself is the city of Zoragmelok, 
a circular fortress surrounded by adamantine walls 
topped with razors and hooks. Corkscrew towers loom 
above twisted domes and vast amphitheaters, just a few 
examples of the city's impossible architecture. 
The challenge rating of Fraz-Urb'luu is 24 (62,000 XP) 
when he's encountered in his lair. 
L AIR A CTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Fraz-
Urb'luu can take a lair action to cause one of the 
following effects; he can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row: 
• Fraz-Urb'luu causes up to five doors within the lair to 
become walls, and an equal number of doors to ap-
pear on walls where there previously were none. 
• Fraz-Urb'luu chooses one humanoid within the lair 
and instantly creates a simulacrum of that creature 
(as if created with the simulacrum spell). This sim-
ulacrum obeys Fraz-Urb'luu's commands and is de-
stroyed on the next initiative count 20. 
Magic Resistance. Fraz-Urb'luu has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Magic Weapons. Fraz-Urb'luu's weapon attacks are magical. 
Undetectable. Fraz-Urb'luu can't be targeted by divination 
magic, perceived through magical scrying sensors, or detected 
by abilities that sense demons or fiends.

LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
Fraz-Urb'luu can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the 
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used 
at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Fraz-
Urb'luu regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn. 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. 
Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a 
Large or smaller creature, it is also grappled (escape DC 24).
