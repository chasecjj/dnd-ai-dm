NUPPERIBO 
No soul is turned away from the Nine Hells, but the truly 
worthless-those whose evil acts in life arose from care-
lessness and sloth more than anything else- are suit-
able only to become nupperibos. These pitiful creatures 
shuffle mindlessly across the landscape: blind, bloated 
from unquenchable hunger, and groping for whatever 
scraps of fetid matter or swarming vermin they can 
scoop into their groaning mouths. 
Nauseating Bulk. Individually, nupperibos are pa-
thetic, but they're rarely alone and can be dangerous 
when gathered into packs. They herd together into 
throngs that can clog a vital passage or an entire valley. 
Clouds of stinging insects, stirges , and other vermin 
surround them in a terrifying, reeking sheath that tor-
ments any non-devil that draws near. 
Hunger Unending. A nupperibo knows nothing but 
the hunger that propels it on a blind quest for anything 
to devour. Once it senses a potential meal, it pursues 
that prey tirelessly until the food is consumed, the nup-
peribo is slain, or some other morsel crosses the fiend's 
path and distracts it. 
Slavish Obedience. With no interest of its own be-
yond the need to consume, a nupperibo obeys unthink-
ingly any command it receives telepathically from an-
other devil. This blind loyalty makes them the easiest of 
infernal troops to lead into battle, but their presence in a 
legion does nothing to elevate its general's status.

Cloud of Vermin. Any creature, other than a devil, that starts its 
turn within 20 feet of the nupperibo must make a DC 11 Consti-
tution saving throw. A creature within the areas of two or more 
nupperibos makes the saving throw with disadvantage. On a 
failure, the creature takes 2 (ld4) piercing damage. 
Hunger-Driven. In the Nine Hells, the nupperibos can 
flawlessly track any creature that has taken damage from any 
nupperibo's Cloud of Vermin within the previous 24 hours. 
ACTIONS 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 6 (ld6 + 3) piercing damage.

When an archduke of the Nine Hells needs a creature 
tracked, found, and either done away with or captured, 
the task usually falls to an orthon. Orthons are infernal 
bounty hunters, tireless in their pursuit of their quarry 
across the multiverse. 
Unseen and All-Seeing. Orthons are infamous for 
their sharp senses. Because an orthon can become 
invisible at will, its quarry is often unaware of being 
hunted until the orthon strikes. The orthon's invisibility 
can be disrupted when the devil is attacked, however, 
so a strong counterattack is often the best defense 
against it. 
A Sporting Chance. Orthons value the challenge of 
the chase and the thrill of one-on-one combat above all 
else. An orthon's first loyalty is to its archduke, but if it 
has no immediate assignment, an orthon might work for 
anyone who offers it the promise of a worthy struggle 
against a lethal foe. Because they travel widely, orthons 
are unequaled as guides through the layers of the 
Nine Hells.

Invisibility Field. The orthon can use a bonus action to become 
invisible. Any equipment the orthon wears or carries is also 
invisible as long as the equipment is on its person. This invisi-
bility ends immediately after the orthon makes an attack roll or 
is hit by an attack. 
Magic Resistance. The orthon has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
A CTIONS 
Infernal Dagger. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach S ft., 
one target. Hit: 11 (2d4 + 6) slashing damage, and the target 
must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) 
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on 
a successful one. On a failure, the target is also poisoned for 
1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on 
a success. 
.. 
Brass Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 
100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage, 
plus one of the following effects: 
1. Acid. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving 
throw, taking an additional 17 (Sd6) acid damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
2. Blindness (1/Day). The target takes S (ldlO) radiant damage. 
In addition, the target and all other creatures within 20 feet of 
it must each make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw 
or be blinded until the end of the orthon's next turn. 
3. Concussion. The target and each creature within 20 feet of 
it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 
(2dl2) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
4. Entanglement. The target must make a successful DC 17 
Dexterity saving throw or be restrained for l hour by strands 
of sticky webbing. A restrained creature can escape by using 
an action to make a successful DC 17 Dexterity or Strength 
check. Any creature other than an orthon that touches the 
restrained creature must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity 
saving throw or become similarly restrained. 
S. Paralysis (1/Day). The target takes 22 (4dl0) lightning dam-
age and must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving 
throw or be paralyzed for l minute. The paralyzed target can 
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending 
the effect on itself on a success. 
6. Tracking. For the next 24 hours, the orthon knows the direc-
tion and distance to the target, as long as it's on the same 
plane of existence. If the target is on a different plane, the 
orthon knows which one, but not the exact location there. 
REACTIONS 
Explosive Retribution. When it is reduced to 15 hit points or 
fewer, the orthon causes itself to explode. All other creatures 
within 30 feet of it must each make a DC 17 Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 9 (2d8) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) thunder damage 
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
This explosion destroys the orthon, its infernal dagger, and its 
brass crossbow.
