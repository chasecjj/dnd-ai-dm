Whisperleaf. This hill takes its name from the im-
possibly large oak tree that grows from its top and 
spreads out to shade much of its slopes. Even when 
Baervan and Chiktikka aren't present in their cottage 
at the base of the tree, its boughs and roots and the 
grassy slopes of the hill are always alive with mischie-
vous animals. 
Stronghaven. Gaerdal's home is a fortress that contains 
a confounding maze of tunnels, designed to defy any 
attempt to invade or infiltrate. Gaerdal, ever watchful 
for any threat to the Golden Hills, is almost always in-
side, not to be found unless she wills it so. 
The Gemstone Burrow. A small round door just below 
the summit of Segojan's hill opens onto a network of 
tunnels and burrows, illuminated by brilliant gems. 
All sorts of burrowing creatures live peaceably with 
gnomish souls here. 
The Workshop. Nebelun's hill is festooned inside and 
out with structures and contraptions of mysterious 
purpose in various stages of completion. Only the 
Meddler can say how she plans for any of these inven-
tions of hers to work. From time to time she gifts one 
of them to a worthy follower, promising that its use 
will bring success- but offering no guarantee that it 
will function the way it was supposed to. 
G N O ME ADVENTU RER S 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE SEEN A GNOME 
tum a dead end into a wonderful opportunity. 
-Delaan Winterhou nd 
When a gnome leaves the burrow, the force behind that 
decision is almost always curiosity- an insatiable need 
to seek out and experience what the world has to offer. 
Sometimes the adventuring life is the natural outgrowth 
of a gnome's research project or experiment. A rock 
gnome alchemist who discovers a new form of fungus 
growing in a nearby cavern might wander farther afield 
from the burrow, looking for knowledge about other 
fungi in the world. A forest gnome who hears about a 
master illusionist in a faraway realm could embark on a 
journey to find that person and learn new tricks. A rock 
gnome artificer might become determined to locate any 
deposits of a rare metal, willing to travel the world high 
and low in search of it. Even a deep gnome might be 
born with an irrepressible urge to leave the Underdark 
and join a group to pursue a life of shared purpose. 
Some gnome communities make a practice of sending 
young adults away from the burrow as a rite of passage, 
encouraging them to explore the realms of humans, 
dwarves, and elves for a time, with instructions to bring 
back information and new ideas for the community. 
Most of these folk return to the burrow at the appointed 
time or even sooner, their curiosity having been satis-
fied. But a few of them take readily to life in the outside 
world and don't come back on schedule, returning to the 
burrow only after spending years or decades away as a 
member of an adventuring party. 
TuE PULL OF THE STARS 
Because of their extensive travels, gnome adventur-
ers often become fascinated with the grandeur of the 
cosmos as seen in the motion of the stars across the 
sky. They view the cosmic array as a giant machine of 
wonderful complexity-a banquet for a curious gnomish 
mind. Many renowned astronomers, wizards, and 
extraplanar travelers are gnomes, having undertaken 
those disciplines in the hope of better understanding the 
workings of the multiverse. 
A GNOME'S ROLE 
Gnomes are valuable members of an adventuring party 
for a number of reasons, derived from both their innate 
abilities and their unique mind-set. 
Possessed of higher intelligence than most other 
races, a gnome can be an important source of knowl-
edge, and can devise solutions for many problems an 
adventuring party encounters. A rock gnome rogue on 
a dungeon expedition, if not lost in thought, can steer a 
party clear of many obstacles. Even the most complex 
magical or mechanical traps can be disarmed by a rock 
gnome who takes pride in solving difficult puzzles. 
A forest gnome's skills are invaluable in the wilder-
ness. Forest gnomes can spot subtle tracks, uncover 
clues that others would miss, and locate the safest path. 
Their illusion magic taunts, deludes, and terrifies ene-
mies at the same time it delights their friends. 
Forest gnomes and rock gnomes also contribute to a 
party by being a source of optimism and levity. Even in 
the worst circumstances, a gnome can find something 
to be hopeful for- an attitude that is infectious and thus 
can keep the group from falling into despair. 
A deep gnome, pragmatic and cautious, brings a sense 
of duty rather than a sense of humor to an adventuring 
group. With their grit and iron will, deep gnomes meet 
adversity with hammers, picks, and their dour, dry wit-
or no wit at all- as their weapons of choice. 
DEEP GNOME CHARACTERS 
At the DM's discretion, you can play a deep gnome char-
acter. When you choose the subrace of your gnome, you 
can choose deep gnome, using the following rules to 
create your character. 
D EEP GNOME TRAITS 
Deep gnomes have the gnome traits in the Player's 
Handbook, plus the subrace traits below. Unlike other 
gnomes, svirfneblin tend to weigh 80 to 120 pounds. 
Short-lived compared to other gnomes, deep gnomes 
mature at the same rate humans do and are considered 
full-grown adults by age 25. They live 200 to 250 years, 
although toil and the dangers of the Underdark often 
claim them before their time.
