everyone on the street or in an audience chamber to see 
that their drow master owns and s ubjugates powerful 
enemies. As such, the creatures are commonly used as 
litter bearers, banner carriers, servers, and footstools. 
Slaves without appreciable value as status symbols 
are used for strenuous or dangerous jobs such as tend-
ing farms, hauling cargo, or hollowing out giant sta-
lagmites and stalactites to make new dwelling spaces. 
When they become too weak or dispirited to work, they 
might be staked out as bait during a hunt, fed to the spi-
ders, or sacrificed to Lolth (and then fed to the spiders). 
Although all slaves are at the bottom of the dark elves' 
social hierarchy, the lowest-ranking drow are consid-
ered little better than slaves themselves. A weak house 
that doesn't ally itself with a protector will be preyed 
on and victimized into extinction. If it does swear alle-
giance to a more powerful house, it avoids being perse-
cuted by other houses but becomes effectively a clan of 
indentured servants. Only the most exceptional females 
in such a clan have any chance of rising above their low 
station, and those who do advance end up hurting rather 
than helping their families because they are adopted 
into the more prestigious house, leaving their original 
house even weaker than before. 
THE D ARK SELDARINE 
Lolth demands the lion's share of worship from the 
drow, according to her wishes and by the command of 
her priestesses. The Spider Queen isn't, however, the 
only entity venerated by drow. They revere a host of di-
vine entities, which they refer to as the Dark Seldarine 
in mockery of the surface elves' deities. The Dark 
Seldarine are mighty, immortal beings, survivors from 
the original group of primal elves who revolted against 
Corellon to remain at Lolth's side. 
The Drow Deities table lists the members of the Dark 
Seldarine. For each god, the table notes alignment, prov-
ince (the god's main areas of interest and responsibility), 
suggested domains for clerics who serve the god, and 
a common symbol of the god. The gods in the table are 
described below. 
LOLTH 
Unlike Corellon, who asks very little of his followers, 
Lolth is a demanding mistress. What she demands most 
of all are sacrifices of treasure and blood. Time and time 
DROW D EITI ES (THE D ARK SELDARIN E} 
D ROW T RANCE: E NTERI NG TH E VOID 
Drow enter trance just as other elves do, but they do not 
experience memories of a primal soul or of past lives. Of-
ten they recall nothing at all, but simply dwell for a time in 
darkness and silence, a respite from the dangers of their 
daily lives. When drow do dream, whether in trance or in 
sleep, they look for signs from Lolth or others of the Dark 
Seldarine. That drow do not experience trance the way 
other elves do lends credence to the idea that their souls 
do not reincarnate. Did Corellon forever bar the souls of 
dark elves from Arvandor and change them in some funda-
mental way? Or does Lolth somehow weave new souls for 
her followers, in the way that Moradin forges new spirits 
for dwarves? Only those entities know for certain. 
again, the screams of sacrificial victims echo through 
Lolth's lightless temples as they fall under the knives of 
her priestesses. Her altars are piled with skulls picked 
clean of flesh by the giant spiders that lurk in the web-
draped stalactites overhead. 
In return for victims and adoration, Lolth grants signs 
of her favor, such as great success during a slave raid 
on the surface, the matron of a rival house being struck 
down by an inexplicable illness, or an heiress to the 
house being born under propitious omens. 
GHAUNADAUR 
This entity is most often referred to as That Which 
Lurks, because uttering its real name risks attracting its 
attention. Its actual form, if it even has one, is unknown; 
it's most often represented as an ooze-like creature with 
many tentacles or a purple pupil surrounded by black in-
stead of white. The liquid nature of Ghaunadaur is sym-
bolic of its unpredictable nature, which is what makes 
attracting its attention so risky. It occasionally rewards 
its followers with supernatural powers or wealth, but it's 
equally likely to curse its faithful with hideous torments 
and afflictions. A subterranean hunter who whispers 
Ghaunadaur's name might stumble into a forgotten 
treasure trove, while a devoted priestess who offers 
long prayers and valuable sacrifices is consumed by a 
gelatinous cube. The entity's random behavior can be an 
attraction to drow who lack status and are desperate to 
achieve it. A small sacrifice and a prayer to That Which 
Lurks might simply go unnoticed by Ghaunadaur, or it 
might punish the petitioner, but there is also a chance of 
receiving a great reward.
