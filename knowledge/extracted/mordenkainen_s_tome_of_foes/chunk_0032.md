one regard, Corellon is as inflexible and unchanging as 
the foundation of the world. And all elves grieve over the 
memories of the irreparably broken bond between them-
selves and their creator. 
THE LONG VIEW 
Elves have a natural life span of seven centuries or lon-
ger. Not surprisingly, this trait affects their attitude and 
outlook toward every aspect of mortal life. 
Events from centuries ago that are distant or even 
ancient history to humans might have been experienced 
firsthand by many elves who are still alive. And an elf's 
memory of such events is likely more accurate than a 
well-researched historian's account, because the elf can 
revisit the memory over and over during trance, fixing it 
more firmly in mind each time. 
The elven sense of value as it relates to time is hard 
for humans to comprehend. An elf seldom becomes 
sentimentally attached to physical objects such as manu-
factured structures and furnishings, except those of per-
sonal significance, for the simple reason that the object 
is likely to become decrepit before the elf does. Even fine 
jewelry and steel swords become tarnished and pitted, 
succumbing to the ravages of age long before the years 
of their elven owners come to an end. 
Paradoxically, elves pay special interest to the ephem-
eral: a cloud of mayflies, bubbles in water, illusions, 
eclipses, rainbows, artistic performances, and so forth. 
They are fascinated by any thing of beauty- an object, 
creature, scene, or event- that might be experienced 
only once, but which can be captured in an elf's memory 
and revisited during trance for the rest of their Jives. 
It's a rare elf who forms strong relationships with peo-
ple of other races, particularly those whose life spans 
are much shorter. Humans like to believe that elves 
don't form close bonds with them because the elves are 
saddened whenever they lose a human friend to death, 
but that's only a portion of the truth. From the elven 
view, humans' lives are over too soon for elves to forge 
what they consider a real friendship. Among elves, a 
hundred years of acquaintance between individuals is 
considered a good foundation for a close relationship. 
In keeping with their seeming aloofness, elves can 
appear cold and emotionless in the face of tragedy. 
They do feel the same pain that others feel, and they 
do mourn their losses. But they also understand, in a 
way that other creatures can't, that all worldly pain is 
fleeting. Also, if an elf becomes too emotionally invested 
in a loss, the experience might be relived during trance 
for centuries to come. Keeping some distance between 
themselves and the concerns of others serves elves best. 
Even though they are stingy with their affection for 
others, most elves are excellent judges of character. 
Thus, they can form superficial associations with other 
creatures very quickly. An elf often knows within min-
utes of meeting someone whether that new acquain-
tance would be a fitting companion for a journey or 
an adventure, and their first impressions are seldom 
wrong- though it might be decades later before the rela-
tionship becomes deeply personal. 
The quality of patience, as other races define it, is so 
ingrained in elves that it goes beyond second nature. 
CHAPTER 2 I ELVES 
When enemies threaten to invade their domain, elves 
are just as often satisfied to wait out the danger in their 
concealed strongholds as to come forth and fight. Re-
maining out of harm's way for a year or even a decade is 
a small price to pay to avoid bloodshed-because elves, 
after all, have all the time in the world. 
CRIMES AND PUNISHMENT 
Consistent with their long perspective on the world and 
their knowledge of its history, elves have a special view 
of morality. They abide by the traditional definitions of 
good and evil, but tinged with elven sensibilities. When 
someone takes the life of another, for instance, the elves 
have a unique way of delivering justice. 
Like most civilized beings, elves consider murder a se-
rious crime, but their reasoning concerning punishment 
is their own. Mortal creatures, such as humans, con-
demn murder and those who commit it because it snuffs 
out a life. Where a mortal's life is concerned, elves see 
things the same way. Even if a murdered creature is 
brought back to life with magic, that doesn't negate the 
crime any more than replacing stolen gold makes up for 
the original act of thievery. But elves aren't truly mortal 
in the way that humans and other creatures are. If an elf 
is killed, the soul is reincarnated into a new body after 
some indeterminate time. Only the deceased elf's am-
bitions and current life goals are cut short; the soul will 
eventually receive another chance at life and fulfillment. 
Because elves are reincarnated, their society treats 
the family and friends of a slain elf as the real victims of 
the murder. The survivors must carry on in life without 
a beloved parent, child, partner, sibling, or companion, 
and might feel that loss for centuries.Justice in such 
cases is geared toward their benefit rather than toward 
avenging the individual whose life was ended. Punish-
ment for the murderer depends to some extent on the 
nature of the crime and whether it was premeditated. It 
can take the form of being exiled from the community, 
paying a great sum to the survivors, or being forced to 
carry on whatever unfinished work the slain elf was en-
gaged in. Of these, exile is the most severe punishment. 
The surface elves' attitude toward murder- which 
some races see as bordering on blase-is carried to the 
extreme by the drow, who have elevated the assassina-
tion of both enemies and friends to an art and who con-
