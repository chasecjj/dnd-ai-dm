later years. Even if such a future life seems tepid and 
unbearably dull during an elf's prime, the psychological 
changes that come with age make this peaceful period 
of existence the most satisfying experience possible for 
an elf's later years. Nevertheless, this fear is immune to 
logic when it arises in adult elves. To avoid the fate they 
dread, consciously or subconsciously, they throw them-
selves into dangerous situations, not caring whether 
they survive or perhaps even hoping they don't. In effect, 
they're looking for another chance, seeing their current 
life or perceived future as unbearable and hoping to stop 
the clock on this mortal body and start afresh. 
ELVES AND MAGIC 
Magic infuses the elves' world. Even so, they aren't born 
with an innate understanding of magic. To master spell-
casting, an elf must devote years of study and practice to 
it, the same as most folk. But from the moment they're 
born, elves are surrounded by a culture, a philosophy, 
and an artistic style that incorporates and subtly reveals 
the mysteries of magic to someone who is receptive to 
the message- which elves certainly are. 
WIZARDRY 
There's a reason most powerful wizards are old. The 
special formulas of action, item, and sound that produce 
wizardly magic require precision, and such precision 
comes only from long practice. More than that, each 
spell a wizard might cast requires a portion of one's 
powerful intellect to be dedicated to the task, with the 
necessary patterns of thought and proper mindset kept 
in stasis, ready to be unleashed. Even after these con-
cepts are mastered, new knowledge of magic remains 
elusive, and a wizard must progress steadily through 
deeper levels of understanding, breaking through men-
tal barriers in order to achieve ever greater mastery. 
Of all peoples, elves are perhaps best suited to wiz-
ardry. They have centuries of life to devote to their 
studies, and their trance effectively gives them extra 
time to practice, as lessons learned during study can be 
reinforced by recalling them during resting periods. The 
rigidity and studiousness required by wizardry would 
seem anathema to a people who can recall a life of 
unfettered exploration and free expression of form, but 
magic provides a means of regaining that power. The 
patience and restraint for which elves are well known 
serves them well in this pursuit. 
Not all elven communities embrace wizardry, but 
most worlds of the multiverse have at least one commu-
nity of elves in which the spellcasters are renowned as 
masters. In some worlds, elves are even credited with 
the invention of the art of wizardry. 
MYTH A LS 
Great works of magic are by no means unique to elves, 
but the creation of mythals seems to be knowledge that 
did originate with them. Known by different names 
on different worlds, a mythal is a persistent magical 
field that changes how reality works over a large area. 
Creating the most powerful of mythals requires many 
wizards of great renown and long experience to engage

in the same ritual, while lesser wizards feed spells into 
the growing webwork of magic. Such a ritual can take 
a long time to perform and sometimes requires the 
sacrifice of lives in order to achieve its purpose, but the 
results can be utterly miraculous. 
The mythal that protected the mighty city of Myth 
Drannor on the world of FaerOn prevented the entrance 
of enemy races such as dragons, illithids, drow, and dop-
pelgangers. It negated spying magic and teleportation, 
and every elf within its bounds gained the power to Ry 
and a multitude of magical protections. 
Similar magic allowed the elves of Krynn to raise a 
mythal at Qualinost. A city of moon-pale stone, its many 
towers stand hundreds of feet tall, and bridges of alabas-
ter arc impossibly through its sky like pale rainbows. 
A mythal can't be dispelled or suppressed by any 
conventional means, nor can its effects. Once one is in 
place, it seemingly lasts forever, since none are known 
to have dissipated. A mythal's nature can only be 
warped or changed, and that can be accomplished only 
through the use of magical energy equal to that required 
for its creation. 
The metropolis ofWaterdeep, which lies on the Sword 
Coast of FaerOn, benefits from mythals that were cre-
ated to protect the capital of a great empire of elves that 
stood on the spot over two thousand years before the 
city's founding. The elves left for Evermeet upon the or-
der of their leader, who commanded the wizards of the 
city to alter the mythal so that evidence of the empire's 
existence was wiped from the surface of the world. 
BLADESONG 
Those who see a bladesinger in battle never forget the 
sight. Surrounded by chaos and blood, the bladesinger 
moves in an otherworldly dance. Spells and sword act 
in concert, meshing awe-inspiring beauty with fear-
some deadliness. When the bladesinger's sword whirls 
through the air so swiftly that it keens and the air hums 
and whistles in chorus, the bladesong has begun- and it 
might be the last thing the bladesinger's enemy hears. 
The elves and half-elves who practice the art of the 
bladesinger, a tradition found primarily on the world of 
Faerfin, appear to be almost casual in combat, deRecting 
opponents' blades while elegantly moving into position 
to score hits in return. A bladesinger wields a weapon 
one-handed, leaving the other free for spellcasting or 
to manipulate a wand that can be incorporated into 
the fighting style. This technique gives a bladesinger 
the freedom of movement necessary for the dancelike 
motions of the various forms of martial art, which allow 
both magical and physical attacks to flow freely.
