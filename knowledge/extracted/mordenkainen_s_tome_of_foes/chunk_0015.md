CULT OF GLASYA

on a cultural and legal basis

ist, knight, noble, spy, thug

level), invisibility (2nd level), haste (3rd level) 
As an expert in finding loopholes and exploiting the law 
for her own good, Glasya is a patron of thieves and other 
criminals, especially corrupt nobles. Her influence is 
supposed to strengthen family bonds, but she has taken 
a liberal interpretation of that and offers gifts that can 
be turned against family members. 
Goblins who risk insurrection against their hobgoblin 
masters make pacts with Glasya, as do kenku who form 
criminal gangs.

cultist, mage, noble, spy, thug 
Signature Spells: Blade ward (cantrip), expeditious 
retreat (1st level), spider climb (2nd level), gaseous 
form (3rd level) 
Levistus has no cult in the traditional sense. Instead, 
he offers favors to those who are desperate to escape a 
seemingly inevitable fate. 
Drow are sometimes worshipers of Levistus, as their 
cruel society often pushes them into situations they feel 
they can't escape. 
WHY DEVILS WANT CULTS 
For all their might, most devils are effectively trapped in 
the Nine Hells. While other planar creatures use magic to 
move between planes, devils require either a portal they 
can physically walk through or a summoning conducted by 
an entity on a distant plane. They have little will in deter-
mining where they can go. 
Because of this restriction, on the Material Plane most 
devils work through cults. Cults typically consist of folk 
who have used rituals to contact devils and pledge their 
souls to them in return for power. The Lords of the Nine 
drive most of the soul trade, and the gifts they can offer 
are determined by Asmodeus's decrees. 
CHAPTER I I THE BLOOD WAR 
Levistus usually grants those who pledge their souls 
to him a single chance to escape from danger, but some 
cunning folk strike a deal with Levistus, pledging their 
souls to him in return for escape at a future date. This 
boon takes the form of the Path of Levistus trait. 
Path of Levistus. This creature magically teleports to a location 
of Levistus's choice within l mile of its location. Using this 
ability also restores all of the creature's hit points. This ability 
can be invoked as an action by the creature or when the crea-
ture would die. Once the creature uses it, the creature can't 
use it again. 
CULT OF M AMMON

comfort and power but to deny wealth and its benefits

ist, noble, spy, thug 
Signature Spells: Mending (cantrip), Tenser's floating 
disk (1st level), arcane lock (2nd level), glyph of 
warding (3rd level) 
Mammon's greed overwhelms everything else. He 
deals with mortals who desire material wealth and pro-
vides them with the ability to spread that greed like an 
infection. 
The greedy duergar and even some dragons are prone 
to falling prey to Mammon's temptations, and merchants 
and trade guilds are vulnerable to his bargains. 
Mammon's cultists can gain the Grasping Hands trait. 
Cult leaders can also gain the Promise of Wealth trait. 
Grasping Hands (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). As a 
bonus action, this creature makes a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check contested by the Wisdom (Insight) check of a creature it 
can see within 15 feet of it. If this creature succeeds, one hand-
held item of its choice that it can see on the target magically 
teleports to its open hand. The item can't be one that the tar-
get is holding, and it must weigh no more than 10 pounds.

eager recruits among those who study magic. Any mon-
sters that use spells, such as storm giants and oni, might 
follow him, and wizards' guilds and conclaves of sages 
are the most likely to come under his influence. 
Mephistopheles's cultists can gain the Spell Shield 
trait. Cult leaders can also gain the Spell Leech trait.
