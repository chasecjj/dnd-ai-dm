T'ITIVILUS 
The gloomy Lord of the Second, Dispater, rules from 
his iron palace, seeming to hide surrounded by its lab-
yrinthine corridors, iron walls, diabolical traps, and 
monstrous servants. So intense is his paranoia that he 
almost never travels farther than the sprawling city that 
lies outside his magnificent palace. Dispater knows he 
has enemies on all sides- enemies who would do to him 
what has been done to the likes of Geryon, Moloch, and 
so many others. 
Dispater is correct to fear, but the true threat comes 
not from without. The lord's great error was allowing 
himself to be seduced by Titivilus, who beguiled his way 
into being the primary advisor in Dispater's household. 
Although he is inferior in physical strength and power 
when compared to other archdevils, Titivilus compen-
sates with cunning. A shrewd and calculating politician, 
he has clawed his way up through the ranks to become 
the second-most powerful fiend in Dis, entirely by say-
ing just the right thing at the right time to get what he 
wanted. Charming and pleasant, he is a master at nego-
tiation, able to twist words in such a way as to leave his 
victims confused and believing they have found a friend 
in Titivilus. Through these skills, Titivilus has manip-
CHAPT.ER 6 I BESTIARY 
ulated everyone along his path to power, either to win 
them over to his cause or to remove them as a threat. 
Since gaining his position, Titivilus has convinced 
Dispater that countless plots are being hatched against 
him and that Asmodeus himself seeks to remove Dis-
pater from power. In response, Dispater has withdrawn 
to his palace and left day-to-day decisions to Titivilus, 
while also authorizing him to answer and negotiate bar-
gains with mortals who attempt to summon Dispater. 
Titivilus now represents his master and speaks with his 
voice, a turn of events that leads some to whisper that ei-
ther Titivilus is Dispater in disguise, or that Titivilus has 
removed the archduke and replaced him altogether. 
Titivilus recognizes the inherent precariousness of 
his position. After all, Dispater's acceptance of his plans 
and his advice can last only so long before some other 
plotter steps in and reveals the truth. For insurance, 
Titivilus has begun recruiting outsiders to deal with 
problem devils, to insulate himself against criticism, 
and, above all, to create complications that he can solve 
so as to reinforce his value in the eyes of his master. Titi-
vilus finds adventurers well suited to the tasks he needs 
performed and recruits them directly or through inter-
mediaries, expending them later as his plans require.

he can choose to succeed instead.

against spells and other magical effects. 
Magic Weapons. Titivilus's weapon attacks are magical. 
Regeneration. Titivilus regains 10 hit points at the start of his 
turn. lfhe takes cold or radiant damage, this trait doesn't func· 
ti on at the start of his next turn. Titivilus dies only if he starts 
his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate. 
Ventriloquism. Whenever Titivilus speaks, he can choose a

duced by an amount equal to half the necrotic damage it takes. 
Frightful Word. Titivilus targets one creature he can see within 
10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom 
saving throw or become frightened of him for 1 minute. While 
frightened in this way, the target must take the Dash action and 
move away from Titivilus by the safest available route on each 
of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it 
needn't take the Dash action. The target can repeat the saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself 
on a success.

ment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccu-
pied space he can see.

saving throw or become charmed by Titivilus for 1 minute. The

any damage to it. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw 
is immune to Titivilus's Twisting Words for 24 hours.

tions below. Only one legendary action option can be used at

tively, he targets one creature charmed by him that is within

risma saving throw. On a failure, Titivilus decides how the 
target acts during its next turn.
