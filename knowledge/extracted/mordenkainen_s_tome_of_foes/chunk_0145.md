MOLOCH 
Exiled from the Nine Hells, Moloch would do anything 
to reclaim his position. Long ago, Moloch earned his 
place among the other archdevils through the glory he 
won driving demons out of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus 
rewarded him by elevating Moloch to the rulership 
of Malbolge. 
For eons, Moloch ruled his domain, vying against the 
other archdevils as he sought still greater power. This 
animosity worked in Asmodeus's favor, since Asmodeus 
knew that Moloch's scheming helped keep the other 
archdevils in check. The arrangement began to unravel, 
however, when Moloch took the night hag named Mal-
agard for his advisor. Her words were poison, and grad-
ually she convinced Moloch to direct his efforts to topple 
Asmodeus. Although the conspiracy nearly succeeded, 
it was thwarted. Moloch was stripped of his station and 
sentenced to death- and only the timely use of a planar 
portal allowed him to escape. 
Moloch wasted no time in preparing for his return. 
He amassed an army of devils and monsters and left 
them to make final preparations for invading the Nine 
Hells, while he ventured to a distant Material Plane in 
the hope of finding an artifact that would ensure his 
success. While there, he became trapped, leaving his 
CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
armies at the mercy of his enemies. In short order they 
were destroyed. 
Now, Moloch has been rendered nearly powerless 
after his last failure. He endlessly schemes of ways to 
return to his former status, but every time he enters the 
Nine Hells, he is demoted to an imp and can't regain his 
normal powers until he leaves. Thus, he lives a split ex-
istence, sometimes scheming in Malbolge or other lay-
ers of the Hells and at other times wandering the planes 
searching for magical might or secrets that might help 
him win back his title. 
Rumors suggest that he can often be found in Sigil, 
where he bargains with yugoloths to build yet another 
army with which he might invade Malbolge and wrest 
the throne from Glasya. Bereft as he is, he has little to 
offer in exchange, so he might bargain with mortals to 
gain their aid in acquiring coin, jewels, and other riches 
in return for knowledge about the Nine Hells and the 
other planes. 
Most of Moloch's cultists have switched allegiance 
to one of the other archdevils, but idols constructed to 
honor him still stand in deep dungeons, their jeweled 
eyes and the remnants of power they hold drawing mon-
strous worshipers and unwise adventurers into places 
where his foul influence remains.

At will: alter self (can become Medium when changing his ap-
pearance). animate dead, burning hands (as a 7th-level spell),

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Moloch fails a saving throw, 
he can choose to succeed instead. 
Magic Resistance. Moloch has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Magic Weapons. Moloch's weapon attacks are magical. 
Regeneration. Moloch regains 20 hit points at the start of his 
turn. lfhe takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at 
the start of his next turn. Moloch dies only if he starts his turn 
with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. Moloch makes three attacks: one with his bite, 
one with his claw, and one with his whip. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage. 
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. 
Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) slashing damage. 
Many-Tailed Whip. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 30 
ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d4 + 8) slashing damage plus 11 (2dl0) 
lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on 
a DC 24 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 30 feet in a 
straight line toward Moloch. 
Breath of Despair (Recharge 5-6). Moloch exhales in a 30-foot 
cube. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 
Wisdom saving throw or take 27 (5dl0) psychic damage, drop 
whatever it is holding, and become frightened for l minute. 
While frightened in this way, a creature must take the Dash ac-
tion and move away from Moloch by the safest available route 
on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which 
case it needn't take the Dash action. If the creature ends its 
turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to Moloch, 
the creature can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the 
effect ends. 
Teleport. Moloch magically teleports, along with any 
equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an 
unoccupied space he can see. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
Moloch can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the op-
tions below. Only one legendary action option can be used at

regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
