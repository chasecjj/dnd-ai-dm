STAR SPAWN 
The Material Plane represents only one small part of 
the multiverse. Beyond the best-known planes of ex-
istence lie realms that are lethal to mortal life. Some 
are so hostile that even a moment's contact with such a 
place is enough to plunge a mortal mind into madness. 
Yet beings do exist that are native to these realms: be-
ings that are eternally hungering, searching, warring, 
sometimes dreaming. These Elder Evils are far older 
than most of the mortal races and always horrific to hu-
manoid minds. 
However much they might desire to enter and domi-
nate the Material Plane, the Elder Evils are unable or 
unwilling to leave their realms. Some are imprisoned 
in their dimensions by external forces, some are inextri-
cably bound to their home realities, and others simply 
can't find any way out. 
Heralds of Doom. The creatures known as star 
spawn are the heralds, servants, foot soldiers, and lieu-
tenants of the Elder Evils, capable of taking on forms 
that can journey to the Material Plane. They arrive most 
often in the wake of a comet- or perhaps such a phe-
nomenon merely signals that star spawn are in the vicin-
ity and available for communication. When the signs are 
right, warlocks and cultists hasten to gather together, 
read aloud their blasphemous texts, and conduct the 
mind-searing rituals that guide the blazing star spawn 
into the world. 
STAR SPAWN GRUE 
Fanged and lipless, the ever-grinning, madly staring 
grue lopes about on spindly legs and long arms. Bristles 
and spines project from odd patches of its pallid skin, 
and it's long fingers end in broken and dirty nails. Grues 
are the weakest of the star spawn. A host of writhing, 
scrambling grues typically accompanies more powerful 
star spawn. Their constant chittering and shrieking pro-
duces discordant psychic energy that disrupts thought 
patterns in other creatures. Intelligent creatures experi-
ence flashing colors, hallucinations, disorientation, and 
waves of hopelessness when they find themselves near a 
group of star spawn grues. 
STAR SPAWN HULK 
The hulk is the largest of the known star spawn. Though 
ogre-like in stature, the hulk's glistening translucent 
skin reveals a muscled form devoid of an ogre's fat. Pale 
and seemingly lidless eyes glare balefully from a face 
distorted by too many teeth and too little nose. 
Hulks are seldom encountered without a commanding 
seer nearby. A hulk appears to have little will of its own, 
other than to protect its master.
