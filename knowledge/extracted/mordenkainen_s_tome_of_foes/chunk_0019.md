The size of the region begins to grow, the effects of the 
lethal environment expanding from the original area. 
The demons likewise begin to roam, and a small force 
capable of establishing its own incursion might travel 
far. If enough of these groups splinter off, the incursion 
could spread into a network of similar sites, each open-
ing its own portal and drawing in more demons. 
Slaying all the demons in an infested area ends their 
direct threat, but the terrain remains twisted and ac-
cursed, the portal dormant but still in place. To repel the 
incursion at this stage, the defenders must not only slay 
the demons but also establish a permanent watch over 
the portal, to ensure that it remains unused. Ambitious 
cultists, or even a random confluence of planar energy, 
could awaken the portal and start the infection anew. 
APOCALYPSE Now 
If the incursion remains unchecked or grows strong 
enough, it enters its fourth and final phase with the en-
trance of a demon lord. As a portal continues to shunt 
demons and abyssal energy into the world, it begins to 
attract the attention of the lords. Two or more of them 
might fight for control of it, or in the worst case, several 
might travel through the portal in rapid succession. 
The visitation of a demon lord to the Material Plane 
is a cataclysmic event. The lord's presence overwhelms 
the minds of other beings to keep them from resisting, 
and the lord's power enables it to command the other 
demons already present in the world. They form a hor-
rid army that sets about stripping the world of life and 
clearing the path for the lord's dominance. 
At this point, a besieged world's only hope for survival 
is the expulsion of the demon lord. The lord's defeat 
leaves the other demons again leaderless, and they re-
act by warring against each other, which makes them 
susceptible to attacks from the world's defenders. The 
longer a demon lord remains in control of all the other 
fiends, the more the world around it becomes irrevoca-
bly changed. When a demonic incursion runs its course, 
no vestige remains of the world that existed before- in 
effect, the realm has become another layer of the Abyss. 
CHAOS I NCARNATE 
Although sages group demons into types according 
to their power, the Abyss knows no such categories. 
Demons are spawned from the stuff of the Abyss in a 
near-infinite variety of shapes and abilities. The com-
mon forms that are familiar to demonologists represent 
broad trends, but individual demons defy those tenden-
cies. For instance, a vrock might crawl out of an oil slick 
in the Demonweb Pits with three eyes and vestigial 
wings. A chasme might appear on the layer of Azzagrat 
possessing the ability to belch forth clouds of flies. 
If a demon survives for centuries, it accumulates 
changes to its form due to interaction with the energies 
of the Abyss. These long-lived demons often become 
demon lords, beings of such power that they can hold 
sway over entire realms within the Abyss. A few demon 
lords have come to the attention of mortals and are even 
worshiped as gods in some places, but the vast majority 
of demon lords remain unknown to scholars and sages.
