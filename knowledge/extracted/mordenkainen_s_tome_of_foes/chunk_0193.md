SWORD WRAITH 
When a glory-obsessed warrior dies in battle without 
earning the honor it desperately sought, its valor-hungry 
spirit might haunt the battlefield as a sword wraith. 
Brooding Spirits. The most likely spots for encoun-
tering sword wraiths are scenes of ancient ambushes, 
battlefields where soldiers were felled by magic with 
no chance to fight back, and sites where enemies were 
hemmed in and slaughtered without quarter. 
Honor Above All. Sword wraiths fly into a rage if 
anyone questions their valor. Conversely, they are easily 
appeased by praise. Little pleases them more than hear-
ing a ballad performed in their honor. Towns located 
near ancient battlefields hold annual festivals of remem-
brance to keep sword wraiths there placated. 
Undead Nature. A sword wraith doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.

Martial Fury. As a bonus action, the sword wraith can make 
one weapon attack, which deals an extra 9 (2d8) necrotic dam-
age on a hit. If it does so, attack rolls against it have advantage 
until the start of its next turn. 
Turning Defiance. The sword wraith and any other sword 
wraiths within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws 
against effects that turn undead. 
ACTIONS

Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one tar-
get. Hit: 8 (ld8 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (ldlO + 4) slashing 
damage if used with two hands.

one target. Hit: 6 (ld8 + 2) piercing damage. 
Call to Honor (1/Day). To use this action, the sword wraith 
must have taken damage during the current combat. If the 
sword wraith can use this action, it gives itself advantage on 
attack rolls until the end of its next turn, and ld4 + 1 sword 
wraith warriors appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet 
of it. The warriors last until they drop to 0 hit points, and they 
take their turns immediately after the commander's turn on the 
same initiative count.
