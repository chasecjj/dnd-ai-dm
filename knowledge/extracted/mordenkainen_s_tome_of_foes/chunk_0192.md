STONE CURSED 
The stone cursed are spawned through a foul alchem-
ical ritual performed on a humanoid that has been 
turned to stone. The ritual, which requires a mixture of 
basilisk blood and the ashes from the burned feathers 
of a cockatrice, awakens a dim echo of the petrified 
victim's spirit, animating the statue and turning it into a 
useful guardian. 
Lingering Spirits. The stone cursed possess a malev-
olent drive to slay the living, yet they are utterly loyal to 
whoever performed the ritual to animate them, and they 
obey that being's orders to the best of their ability. 
In combat, stony claws that drip with thick, gray 
sludge emerge from a stone cursed's fingers. This al-
chemical sludge transforms those slashed by the claws 
into statues. 
A Strange Harvest. As part of the ritual used to 
create a stone cursed, a fist-sized obsidian skull forms 
within the creature's torso. The skull isn't visible while 
the stone cursed is active, but when it is slain, the statue 
shatters and the skull clatters to the ground. Because 
it is the nexus for the alchemy used to create these hor-
rors, a dim echo of the original victim's memories res-
onates within the skull. A skilled magic-wielder can at-
tempt to extract memories from it to gain insight into the 
victim's past or find lore that otherwise would be lost. 
Constructed Nature. A stone cursed doesn't require 
air, food, drink, or sleep. 
CRYPTIC WHISPERS 
Even though creatures transformed into stone cursed are 
long dead, a vague whisper of their memories lives on in 
the obsidian skull embedded within the stone cursed's 
body. At the end of a short rest, a character can make a 
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to attempt to extract a 
memory from the skull- a memory that is a response to a 
verbal question posed by the character to the skull. Once 
this check is made, whether it succeeds or fails, the skull 
can't be used in this manner again.
