the fate of an allied stronghold that has fallen silent. 
They are held in high esteem by their clan mates, since 
they have dared to forsake the safety of home for the un-
certainty of the upper world. When their mission is over, 
they return to the stronghold and are hailed as heroes. 
Other dwarves turn to a life on the outside because 
they are misfits who found the stronghold stultifying 
or outcasts who were forced to leave the clan because 
of criminal behavior. Not all dwarves are born with the 
same strong sense of community, and the strictures of 
society can prove difficult for some to accept. Such an 
individual might protest an arranged marriage or insist 
that the priests of Moradin have erred in deciding their 
vocation. The rest of the clan views these malcontents 
with mistrust, and those who remain disruptive can find 
themselves exiled. 
H AZARD OUS D UTY 
Some dwarves leave the stronghold to serve the clan 
in nontraditional ways as envoys, explorers, crafters, 
and merchants. Although a human wouldn't think of all 
these folk as adventurers, in the dwarves' view they are 
undertaking a dangerous mission. 
Even when dwarves volunteer for a life in the outside 
world, whether to take up true adventuring or to pur-
sue a mundane occupation, they remain members of 
the clan, and their duties almost always include some 
responsibility to the clan. A blacksmith working in a 
human village, for instance, might report news of the 
outside world back to the clan. 
Dwarves who reside in surface communities prefer 
to keep to themselves when not plying their trades, but 
over time they might develop close relationships with 
neighbors of other races- much in the same way that 
dwarves who join an adventuring party learn to trust 
their companions. 
CASTOFFS AND CRIMINALS 
Of course, not every dwarf is destined for a long life in 
service to the clan. A few are born with a tendency to 
think and behave in ways that undermine the clan rather 
than supporting it, and those who don't change their 
ways are cast out. 
Some of these independent dwarves, especially those 
who espouse the moral and ethical standards of their 
kin, end up becoming adventurers. Their companions 
and allies satisfy every dwarf's innate need to belong to 
a clan, and those folk become the beneficiaries of the 
dwarf's industriousness and loyalty. 
For dwarves of evil temperament, the place of one's 
clan is liable to be taken by a group such as an assas-
sins' guild or an outlaw gang. Those who understand 
their role in the organization and abide by its hierarchy 
are some of the most loyal followers a would-be con-
queror could acquire. 
MAGIC: Goos' GIFT TO D WARVES 
Dwarves are of two minds on the topic of magic. 
They view divine magic as a gift from their gods, a direct 
helping hand meant to aid them in their effort to follow 
their gods' examples. Indeed, many forms of divine magic 
are essential for the smooth operation of any stronghold 
and the continued survival of the clan. For that reason, 
clerics are more common among the dwarves than in 
other races. Dwarves who are especially devoted to the 
clan are believed to have a special connection to the dei-
ties, and often learn how to use that conduit to bring forth 
divine magic. 
Arcane magic in all its forms is a different matter. 
Dwarves have no innate fear or hatred of such things, but 
arcane magic has no true patron among the dwarven dei-
ties. As such, the dwarves ignore it in their daily lives, and 
clan members who take up the practice are exceedingly 
rare. Using arcane magic to assist in the creation of one's 
works is anathema to almost all dwarves, because the act 
amounts to nothing more than cheating. The few dwarves 
who embrace arcane magic tend to venerate Abbathor, if 
only in secret. 
Evil dwarves with no respect for authority or commu-
nity are few and far between. Shunned by the rest of 
their race, they take perverse delight in raiding villages, 
enslaving or killing innocents, and otherwise venting 
their rage against the world. 
DUERGAR 
Duergar see themselves as the true manifestation of 
dwarven ideals, clever enough not to be taken in by the 
treacherous deceptions of Morad in and his false prom-
ises. Their period of enslavement and the revolt against 
the mind flayers led by their god, Laduguer, purged the 
influence of the other dwarven gods from their souls 
and thus made them into the superior race. 
Duergar have no appreciation for beauty, that ability 
having been erased from their minds by the mind flayers 
long ago and any thought of recapturing it obliterated by 
Moradin's betrayal. The duergar lead bleak, grim lives 
devoid of happiness or satisfaction, but they see that as 
their defining strength-the root of duergar pride, as it 
were- rather than a drawback to be corrected. 
A D ARK R EFLECTION 
WORK OR DIE. IN THE FIRST CASE, YOU ARE USEFUL. IN 
the second, you are entertaining. 
-Vozala Spikefist 
Duergar society is a dark mirror of the dwarven clan. 
Where dwarves toil for love of industry, duergar do so 
out of a drive to create and own as much goods and 
treasure as possible. Their priests assign vocations and 
arrange marriages, but only to ensure that a clan contin-
ues to exist, not out of any sense of creating a legacy. 
In many ways, the culture of the duergar is fundamen-
tally hollow. For all their wars, and all the treasures they 
have accumulated, duergar feel no happiness or satis-
faction. They simply continue to exist, ever-turning cogs 
in an engine of destruction that is the antithesis of the 
dwarves' joyful cycle of creation.
