of happiness, contentedness, and trust are forbidden. 
The duergar are bound together in a rigid society, but 
it is a marriage of necessity rather than choice. In the 
Underdark, they must cooperate to survive. Within their 
society, each individual fills a role assigned to them and 
must perform it to the best of their abilities. 
Duergar warriors epitomize the race's abandonment 
of emotion and individuality. In battle, they wear heavy 
armor and hateful, scowling masks that hide their iden-
tities. When assembled in ranks, the duergar move for-
ward like army ants. They are an implacable, relentless 
foe, marching over the corpses of their fallen comrades 
to press the attack.

-Morkai Ash lord 
Two mythic figures who were long ago responsible for 
the duergar's liberation have achieved divinity in the 
eyes of their supplicants. 
The Duergar Deities table provides basic information 
about each one: alignment, province (the god's main 
areas of interest and responsibility), suggested domains 
for clerics who serve the god, and a common symbol 
of the god. 
DEEP DUERRA 
According to legend, Deep Duerra stole the power 
of psionics from the mind flayers and gifted it to her 
people. Her command of it was so great that she domi-
nated a mind flayer colony and turned the illithids into 
her slaves. 
Deep Duerra's followers stand at the forefront of the 
duergar's attacks on their most hated enemies. Inspired 
by her mythic deeds, her priests are especially eager 
to find and annihilate dwarf communities and mind 
flayer colonies. 
The priests of Deep Duerra maintain a training 
ground and armory inside each duergar stronghold. All 
duergar are required to learn the basic skills of combat, 
and the nobles are obliged to contribute weapons, ar-
mor, and followers to the stronghold's defensive force. 
The priests honor their deity by planning, equipping, 
and launching holy crusades against their enemies. 
LADUGUER 
Also known as the Grim One, Laduguer was a mighty 
duergar warrior who liberated his people from the il-
lithids. Laduguer entered into a pact with Asmodeus, 
pledging the duergar to an alliance against Lolth and

the demons of the Abyss in exchange for which Ladu-
guer received a spark of divinity from Abbathor himself. 
Laduguer's teachings stand in direct opposition to ev-
erything Moradin represents. He is the dwarf god's dark 
opposite, a shadow that seeks to rise up and consume 
its original creator. 
Duergar don't worship Laduguer in any traditional 
way; their communities include no temples or formal 
services. They honor their deity by acquiring more 
power and wealth through any means possible. Priests 
of Laduguer maintain the internal functions of duergar 
society but have no role that is expressly religious. 
INSIDE A STRONGHOLD 
Duergar strongholds are best defined in terms of how 
they compare to the underground fortresses of the 
dwarves. Both places constantly bustle with activity, 
forges and picks and hammers always at work, but that's 
where the similarity ends. 
In a dwarven stronghold, the atmosphere is one of 
optimistic industry. Dwarves enjoy what they do, and 
their dedication to furthering the clan and leaving a 
proper legacy shows through in every aspect of a clan's 
operation. 
In contrast, the duergar care nothing for the dwarven 
ideal of achieving utmost mastery of a craft. For this 
reason, they pay no mind to their environment or the 
aesthetics of their creations. In a duergar stronghold, 
the atmosphere is one of unrelenting drudgery. Quantity, 
not quality, is at the heart of their efforts, as the duergar 
strive to craft as many items as possible in the shortest 
period of time. Duergar goods aren't flawed or substan-
dard, but are plain to the point of austerity. To the duer-
gar, a manufactured object is useful only for the function 
it performs. 
In a typical stronghold, the workshops occupy the 
central chamber. The smoke that belches from them fills 
the air and drifts into surrounding passages.
