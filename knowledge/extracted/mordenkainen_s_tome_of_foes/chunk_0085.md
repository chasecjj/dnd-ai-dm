THE SHA
1SAL KHOU 
The Sha'sal Khou is an organization of githyanki and 
githzerai radicals working toward the reunification of their 
peoples. They want to bring about the end of the warfare 
between the githyanki and githzerai and the creation of 
a new unified nation of all gith. Members of the Sha'sal 
Khou work secretly within their respective societies, 
subtly discouraging attacks on the other gith race while 
looking for signs of like-minded individuals who might be 
recruited. The group maintains hidden redoubts on the 
Material Plane as well. 
The goal of the organization is to raise a proper army 
and establish a fortified enclave where children will grow 
up calling themselves simply "gith." The group's most 
high-ranking advocate in the githyanki hierarchy is a pow· 
erful warlord named Zetch'r'r. He secretly supports the 
reunification of the githyanki and the githzerai, and works 
behind the scenes to turn others toward the cause.
