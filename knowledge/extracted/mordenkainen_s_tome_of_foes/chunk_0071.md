BUILDING BETTER SLAVES 
For generations, duergar relied on humanoid captives 
to perform unskilled labor in their workshops. Only the 
lowest, most miserable duergar would consent to do 
grunt work that requires no artifice or skill. 
In recent decades, however, the duergar have begun 
to move away from the practice of slavery. Some of them 
have discovered that mechanical servitors powered by 
psionic energy are more durable and more efficient than 
slaves. Thus, various kinds of automatons have been 
developed, each designed to fill a role within a duergar 
stronghold. Some clans have created models to make 
raiding parties more formidable. Other forms include 
digging and tunneling machines, golem-like monstrosi-
ties that tear through rock and extract ore from it. 
DUERGAR CHARACTERS 
Those duergar who become adventurers are almost 
invariably exiles from their society. The duergar have no 
patience for those who fail to conduct themselves with 
an appropriate amount of ambition and cruelty. 
Any gray dwarves who leave the Underdark and take

magic turned the aboleth's brain to dust, I inhaled deeply 
of the leavings, and a nearly infinite roll of years began to 
unspool before my eyes. 
I saw a red sun hanging in the sky over a desolate land, 
where the ruins of a castle slowly sank into a sea of dust. 
I saw an alien empire in a formless, silver realm vanish 
in the wink of an eye, its slaves left to fend for themselves. 
I felt the pull of a force more ancient than the gods, one 
that remained beneath the surface of my consciousness 
but was ready to receive a new disciple.

Since the day of my awakening I have felt a presence in 
the back of my mind, something that pushes to be set free 
as I struggle to stifle it. It grows, even as my abili~ to .keep 
it inside falters. Will there come a day when my mind is no 
longer my own?

At the DM's discretion, you can play a duergar charac-
