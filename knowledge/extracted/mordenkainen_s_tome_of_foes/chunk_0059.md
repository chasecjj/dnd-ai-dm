attention to detail in order to yield the best, most satisfy-
ing results. 
Young nobles apprentice for a time with masters of 
every profession in the clan. This period of work and 
education has two important results. First, the appren-
ticeships expose a young noble to each part of the clan's 
operation and create personal ties between the appren-
tice and every group in the clan's society. By the time a 
noble takes on a leadership role, the noble has a clear 
overview of all the clan's interrelationships and has 
formed friendships with people from every spot on the 
spectrum of roles within the clan. 
More important, a young noble's conduct while pur-
suing a variety of tasks gives the elder nobles a chance 
to assess the youth's character. Ideally, a noble who as-
cends to the leadership of a clan demonstrates an even 
temperament and an affinity for the clan's key functions. 
A noble who particularly enjoys fighting might become a 
minister of war or a general, while one who loves smith-
ing might become an overseer of the crafters' work. 
ONE FOR ALL: THE STRONGHOLD 
l LIVE H ERE AMONG MY FOLK, AND I SWEAR THAT IF NEED 
be I will die here atop a mountain of my enemies' corpses. 
- King Ulaar Strongheart 
Every dwarf clan maintains a stronghold, typically a se-
ries of chambers dug out beneath a mountain or inside 
a hill. The stronghold is a haven from the chaos of the 
outside world, allowing the dwarves to toil in peace. The 
first concern of any stronghold is defense, but older and 
prosperous strongholds can grow to become wondrous 
underground cities filled with generations of exquisite 
dwarven artisanship. 
Regardless of a clan's size and status, its stronghold 
is a stony personification of the clan itself- what's good 
for the clan is good for the stronghold, and vice versa. lf 
a stronghold fails from within, or falls victim to outside 
forces, such an event is often the clan's death knell. 
A LIVING MONUMENT 
The masons and stone carvers in a clan consider the 
stronghold to be their greatest work. In a typical strong-
hold, stone bridges arc over chasms, their surfaces 
embellished with fine carvings and intricate patterns. 
The great stone doors leading outside can withstand a 
battering ram when secured, but glide open at the touch 
of a child when they are unlocked. While some other 
races erect statues or build special structures to honor 
their heroes or commemorate momentous events, the 
dwarves live and work within their greatest memorial. 
A clan's stronghold holds the record of its history and 
accomplishments. A work that an outsider regards as 
"merely" intricate stone carving might actually be a 
carefully composed recounting of deeds, events, and 
important persons. Dwarves combine their runes into 
patterns, present pictorial histories in seemingly uncon-
nected murals and images, and otherwise leave their 
clan's legacy of accomplishments hiding in plain sight. 
The story of the clan is meant to be appreciated by clan 
members and fellow dwarves, not the few outsiders who 
might be allowed inside the stronghold.
