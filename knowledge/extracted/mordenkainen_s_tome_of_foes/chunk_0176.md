OB LEX 
By experimenting on the slimes, jellies, and puddings 
that infest the depths of the Underdark, mind flayers 
created a special breed of ooze, the oblex- a slime capa-
ble of assaulting the minds of other creatures. Cunning 
hunters, these pools of jelly stalk prey, searching for the 
memories they so desperately crave. When oblexes feed 
on those thoughts, sometimes killing their victims, they 
can form weird copies of their prey, which help them to 
harvest even more victims for their dark masters. 
Memory Eaters. Oblexes feed on thoughts and mem-
ories. The sharper the mind, the better the meal, so 
oblexes hunt obviously intelligent targets such as wiz-
ards and other spellcasters. When suitable fare comes 
within reach, an oblex draws its body up to engulf its 
victim. As it withdraws, it plunders the creature's mind, 
leaving its prey befuddled and confused. 
Ooze Nature. An oblex doesn't require sleep. 
0BLEX SPAWN 
An oblex devours memories not only to sustain its exis-
tence, but also to spawn new oblexes. Each time it fully 
drains the memories of a victim, it gains the creature's 
personality-now twisted by the oblex's foul nature. The 
more memories an oblex steals, the larger it becomes, 
until it must shed a personality it has absorbed or else 
go insane. This act spawns a new oblex. 
ADULT AND ELDER 0BLEXES 
Newly formed oblexes lack the capabilities of their older 
kin. They seek only to feed on memories and grow until 
they can impersonate their victims. 
Older oblexes, called adults and elders, have eaten 
so many memories that they can form duplicates of 
the creatures they have devoured from the substance 
of their bodies, sending them off to lure prey into their 
clutches, while remaining tethered to the slime by long 
tendrils of goo. These duplicated creatures are indistin-
guishable from their victims except for a faint sulfurous 
smell. Oblexes use these duplicates to lure prey into 
danger or to infiltrate settlements so they can feed on 
superior victims.

thoughts, hold person (as 3rd-level spell)

Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen.

This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the 
creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The 
oblex can impersonate ld4 + 1 different creatures, each one 
tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 
120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the 
oblex, meaning that the oblex occupies its space and the simu-
lacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to 
damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch 
wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The 
simulacrum disappears ifthe tether is severed. 
A CTIONS 
Multiattack. The oblex makes one pseudopod attack and uses 
Eat Memories. 
Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach S ft., one 
target. Hit: 7 (ld6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus S (2d4) psy-
chic damage. 
Eat Memories. The oblex targets one creature it can see within 
5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 1 S Wisdom saving 
throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and become memory 
drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits 
from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, oozes, 
plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. 
While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and sub-
tract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it 
makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the 
first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 
becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which 
point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect 
then ends. 
When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, 
the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains 
all its proficiencies, except for any saving throw proficiencies.
