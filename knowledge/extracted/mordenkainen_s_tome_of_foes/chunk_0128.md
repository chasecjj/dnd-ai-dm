CHAPTER 6 I BESTll\RY 
jUIBLEX 
Called the Faceless Lord and the Oozing Hunger in an-
cient grimoires.Juiblex is demon lord of slime and ooze, 
a noxious creature that doesn't care about the plots and 
schemes of others of its kind. It exists only to consume, 
digesting and transforming living matter into more 
of itself. 
A true horror, juiblex is a mass of bubbling slime, 
swirling black and green, with glaring red eyes floating 
and shifting within it. It can rise up like a 20-foot hill, 
lashing out with dripping pseudopods to drag victims 
into its bulk. Those consumed by juiblex are obliterated. 
Only the truly insane worship Juiblex and tend to its 
slimes and oozes. Those who offer themselves up to 
the demon lord are engulfed by it and become vaguely 
humanoid, sentient oozes. The bodies of these former 
flesh-and-blood creatures formjuiblex's extended physi-
cal body, while the demon lord slowly digests and savors 
their identities over time. 
jurBLEx's LA_I_R _________ _ 
Juiblex's principal lair is known as the Slime Pits, a 
realm thatJuiblex shares with Zuggtmoy. This layer 
of the Abyss, which is also known as Shedaklah, is a 
bubbling morass of oozing, fetid sludge. Its landscape 
is covered in vast expanses of caustic and unintelligent 
slimes, and strange organic forms rise from the oceans 
of molds and oozes atJuiblex's command. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties),Juiblex can 
take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it 
can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
• Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see 
within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. 
The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away 
with fire. When the slime appears, each creature in 
that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving 
throw or become restrained. When a creature enters 
the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn 
there, that creature must make the same save. 
A restrained creature is stuck as long as it remains 
in the slimy area or until it breaks free. The restrained 
creature, or another creature that can reach it, can 
use its action to try to break free and must succeed on 
a DC 21 Strength check. 
If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 
round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning 
slime takes 22 (4dl0) fire damage. 
• Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see 
within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. 
The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away 
with fire. When the slime appears, each creature on 
it must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or 
fall prone and slide 10 feet in a random direction de-
termined by a d8 roll. When a creature enters the area 
for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, that 
creature must make the same save. 
If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 
round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning 
slime takes 22 (4dl0) fire damage.
