TIAMAT WAITS AND WATCHES 
The Queen of Dragons resides in Avernus. Her lairs sits 
atop a towering mountain, with flights of dragons wheel· 
ing through the skies to discourage any demonic incur-
sions. For their part, the demons avoid this place. The 
hordes of the Abyss have learned the hard way that Tiamat 
and her court prefer to be left alone. She appears disinter-
ested in becoming involved in the Blood War. 
Tiamat's presence in Avernus has confounded sages for 
years. As with devils, she is unable to leave the plane of 
her own will. She must be called forth, but only the might-
iest rituals can draw her back into the world. So, if she has 
been imprisoned here, how and why did that come about? 
The most prevalent theory holds that her confinement 
is related to the end of the long war between the dragons 
and giants, that she was sequestered here by means of a 
mighty curse levied by a forgotten god of the giants she 
slew. The curse brought an end to the war but also drew 
the curtain on the time of the dragons and giants on the 
Material Plane, clearing the way for the rise of humans, 
ores, dwarves, elves, and other folk. lfTiamat were to 
return to the material world, that event could trigger, or 
be a signal of, the resumption of the war between giants 
and dragons. 
vering stand in stark contrast to Bel's approach, which 
relied on his expertise in logistics and defensive tactics 
to make steady but slow advances. Bel remains one of 
her chief lieutenants, and he doesn't discourage her 
reckless tactics in the hope that she will overextend her 
forces and suffer a defeat that leads to her removal. 
For now, though, the devils are fighting with a ber-
serker fury under her charge. Zariel leads their offen-
sives herself, and her unyielding resolve coupled with 
the fighting skill of her underlings has pushed nearly all 
the demonic invaders out of Avernus. 
THE W ARRIOR'S GENERAL 
Zariel is no politician. She lives to fight, and she bases 
her assessment of those she meets on a combination of 
their combat skills and their willingness to use those 
skills. In Zariel's eyes, zeal and fury are as important in 
a fight as iron discipline and extensive training. 
That outlook has made her something of a political 
pariah, since she has spurned overtures of alliance from 
other Lords of the Nine and elected to swell the ranks 
of her armies through the aggressive recruitment of 
mortal souls. Her agents offer gifts of martial skill and 
courage to any who are willing to bargain. Zariel needs 
souls that yearn to prove their worth on the battlefield. 
LADY OF RUIN 
Zariel rules over the ruin that Avernus has become. 
Once it was a bustling realm filled with cities, trade 
outposts, and other features, but recent activity in the 
Blood War has reduced it to a blasted wasteland. The 
few structures still standing are citadels constructed by 
the devils to repel attackers, to be rebuilt each time the 
front line of the war moves. The devils are in control of 
Avernus at present, though the fighting goes on (as it al-
ways does) in isolated locales throughout the layer. 
Adventurers able to avoid the other occupants can find 
treasure within some of the ruins, though they must ven-
ture to the fringes of the active conflict to have any hope 
of finding places that have not yet been looted. 
Many of the active citadels on Avernus loom over the 
River Styx or surround portals to other planes or to Dis. 
An amnizu presides over each location, directing the 
lemures that emerge from the Styx, marshaling forces 
against invaders, and preventing unauthorized travel. 
DISPATER 
THE COSMOS IS A GRAND GAME. HE WHO KNOWS ITS 
rules the best shall win the prize. 
-Dispater 
Dispater is the foremost arms dealer of the Nine Hells, 
and perhaps the greatest weapons supplier in all the 
planes. As the lord of Dis, he oversees a mining and 
smelting operation that continually churns out weapons 
and armor. Using some of the great number of secret 
techniques Dispater has unearthed over his lifetime, the 
foundries of Dis produce deadly armaments that help to 
stem the abyssal tide. The fighting requires constant re-
inforcements, creating a voracious appetite for the prod-
ucts of the iron mines on Dis and the workshops in the 
sprawling metropolis that shares the name of the layer. 
Dispater trusts no one and dislikes surprises. Since 
Zariel's rise to power, he has taken to dwelling in the 
libraries inside his iron palace. He employs a network 
of spies and informants to watch over anyone that might 
threaten him, a measure of his deep paranoia. Dispater 
has created an impenetrable suit of adamantine armor 
for himself, imbued with charms designed to foil spells 
and keep him safe in any environment, no matter how 
hostile. No one can guess at all of its features, since he 
crafted it using methods that only he has mastered. 
Dispater's paranoia affects everything he does. For 
example, he often dispatches orders and other missives 
by branding his message on the back of an imp. The imp 
wears a leather vest that conceals the message, and the 
laces of the vest are knitted into the imp's heart. If the 
vest is removed by anyone other than the intended recip-
ient, that act kills the imp and causes its body to disinte-
grate before the message can be read. 
The lord of Dis measures everything in terms of 
the knowledge it contains and the secrets that can be 
gleaned from it. He yearns to solve every mystery of the 
cosmos, a quest that might seem foolhardy for anyone 
other than an immortal being. Any hint of a secret that 
remains hidden draws his attention, and a discovery 
that could tip the scales in his favor might be enough to 
entice him to act against his fellow Lords of the Nine. 
Given his reclusive nature, gaining an audience with 
Dispater is difficult at best, with no guarantee that any 
correspondence truly reaches him. 
THE GREATEST GAME 
Dispater's trade in souls is concerned mainly with the 
acquisition of secrets. His imps scour the Material 
Plane in search of any lost lore that could help to turn a 
soul to Dispater's service. Such a secret could be a lost 
spell sought by a mighty archmage, who pledges fealty 
to Dispater in return for the knowledge, or it could be 
the identity of a petitioner's secret admirer. Dispater and 
his minions know that the perceived value of a secret is
