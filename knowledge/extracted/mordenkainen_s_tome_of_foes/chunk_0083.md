if they investigate, they soon identify the citadel as the 
cause. The githyanki, however, find it in their best inter-
est to keep their citadels safe from discovery. Menyar-Ag 
prefers to plant them in desolate and rarely frequented 
places such as barren deserts or remote locations in the 
Underdark. 
The primary purpose of an adamantine citadel is to 
watch over the activity of some foe of the githzerai, such 
as an illithid colony, and to provide a base of operations 
for a possible attack. Citadels are also used to collect 
foodstuffs and other material goods for transport to 
Limbo. When the githzerai are finished with a citadel, 
they vacate it and return to Limbo. Immediately after the 
last anarch teleports away, the citadel vanishes, leaving 
only a scarred landscape to indicate where it once stood. 
SPREADING THE WORD 
The githzerai see their cause as not just a provincial 
concern, but one that they strive to impress upon others. 
As such, they have taken the initiative in preaching the 
philosophy of Zerthimon and sharing their knowledge 
of how to fight illithids and githyanki. To this end, zerths 
sometimes venture to other planes with the intent of 
founding a new monastery or joining an existing one. 
These ''missionaries" are always looking for those with 
psionic potential who can bring those powers to bear 
against the githzerai's foes. Most often, they operate in 
secret or behind the scenes as they pursue their agenda 
and try to swell the ranks of their allies. Who can say 
how many monasteries are in truth secret recruiting sta-
tions for the githzerai? 
GOING ON THE ATTACK 
The githzerai know full well that they can't make prog-
ress in the war against their enemies by staying inside 
their fortresses on Limbo. To check the advances of the 
illithids and the githyanki and keep their foes' numbers 
down, squads of githzerai often travel to other planes 
with the express intent of destroying the objects of 
their hatred. 
Githyanki. Githzerai rarely confront githyanki on 
their home turf in the Astral Plane, but on other planes 
they maintain steady surveillance, always on the lookout 
for githyanki plots to foil and creches to exterminate. 
During a mission of this sort, the githzerai don't inten-
tionally endanger the natural denizens of the plane, 
but they never compromise a planned attack on the 
githyanki just to protect innocent bystanders. In battling 
githyanki, the end justifies the means. 
Githzerai sometimes employ mercenaries on the 
Material Plane to aid them in battling the githyanki, 
primarily to keep their enemies off-balance or to provide 
reinforcements. For those who need such enticement, 
they offer the promise of sharing the bounty of great 
treasures held by the githyanki. 
Mind Flayers. Though they devote most of their 
military efforts to the constant campaign against the 
githyanki, the githzerai's enmity for the illithids is even 
older. On one thing the githyanki and the githzerai can 
agree: the mind flayers must pay for what they did to the 
gith eons ago.
