as long as they never had to lay eyes on the drow or view 
the results of their efforts. 
But drow society is predicated on a foundation ofter-
ror and slavery, and the most desirable slaves live on the 
world's surface: humans, dwarves, and best of all, other 
elves. To the dark elves, raiding the surface for captives 
and treasure isn't just a cultural and military tradition, 
but also an economic necessity. 
Some raids are major operations that involve hun-
dreds of warriors, mages, priestesses, and giant spiders, 
a large enough force to overwhelm a community. The 
invaders would sweep through the town in the dark of 
night, shackle the best potential slaves into long trains 
of chattel, kill everyone who resisted, burn everything to 
the ground, and set their sights on the next town in line. 
Most of the dark elves' raids, however, are small, 
stealthy, one-night missions. The drow scout their tar-
gets in advance, then strike on a night when the moon is 
new or its light is obscured by thick clouds. They might 
kill indiscriminately to spread terror, while at other 
times they slip into a village, knock out their targets with 
poison, and spirit their captives away without even wak-
ing the neighborhood dogs. Sometimes a raid uses both 
tactics; one squad sets fires or sets off alarms to focus 
the defenders' attention on one area, as another team 
strikes at the real target on the other side of town. 
Loot is a secondary goal on almost all raids; taking 
prisoners is the primary objective. Some of the dark 
elves' victims become slaves, some end up as food for gi-
ant spiders or other monsters that the drow have trained 
CH1\ PTER 2 I ELVES 
to serve them, and some are laid out across blood-
stained altars and sacrificed to Lolth. 
The drow know how vulnerable they are during day-
light, so they typically plan raids that can be executed 
within the span of a single night. As a rule, that means 
their target must be no more than a few hours' march-
eight to twelve miles is typical- from an entrance to the 
Underdark. Ideally, they'll have more than one return 
path mapped out; if an escape route is blocked, they can 
switch to another and get safely home. 
Once the raiders get inside their escape tunnel, they're 
usually safe. Opposing forces seldom pursue the drow 
below ground for good reason- beyond the light lies 
unmapped enemy territory where everything they meet 
is likely to be hostile. In special circumstances, such as 
if one of the raiders' captives is a royal heir or the scion 
of a wealthy family, adventurers might be hired to mount 
a rescue mission. Otherwise, it's rare for any rescuers 
to follow the kidnappers' trail deep into the deadly dark-
ness without becoming victims themselves. 
SLAVES AND STATUS 
The drow are known and feared throughout the world 
for their practice of slavery, but those who have visited 
their cities report that slaves aren't as prevalent as the 
dark elves' reputation would suggest. In general, only 
powerful houses hold significant numbers of slaves, and 
the slaves of a house are never more numerous than its 
population of drow. 
Slaves are often kept as signs of status as much as for 
their intrinsic worth as laborers. When they are put to 
work, they are also put on display, doing jobs that enable
