The outer edges of the stronghold are honeycombed 
with mining operations. The duergar wrest rock from 
the cavern walls and process the chunks in search of 
useful ore, pulverizing them with powerful mechanical 
devices and sorting out the metals, minerals, and gems. 
Between the mines and the workshops stands a ring 
of fortresses, each ruled by a noble and occupied by the 
noble's followers. The stronghold's king commands the 
largest edifice, five times the size of the next biggest. 
The priests of Deep Duerra reside in the second larg-
est fortress, which houses the duergar army. The priests 
organize patrols and guard duty and oversee the settle-
ment's armory. 
Steeders, spiders that are used as mounts and war 
beasts by the duergar, are housed in stables that stand 
between the workshops and the fortresses. Each enclo-
sure is virtually an individual prison, s ince the violent 
creatures must be kept apart lest they tear into each 
other or wreak havoc in some other way. Only careful 
supervision and brutal discipline keep them in line 
when they are out of their cages. Each noble is responsi-
ble for maintaining a set of steeder pens, and a squad of 
duergar are assigned to train and supervise the beasts. 
POWER OF THE MIND 
THE MIND IS BUT ANOTHER MATERIAL, SET BEFORE US TO 
shape into a weapon. 
-Gargosa Ironmind 
During their period of slavery under the mind flayers, 
the duergar were the subjects of a variety of bizarre ex-
periments that endowed them with psionic abilities. 
CHAPTER 3 I DWARVES ANO DUERGAR 
Every duergar is born with some amount of psionic 
talent. The typical warrior can turn invisible or increase 
in size, and some duergar take up a more formal study 
of psionics to enhance or augment their capabilities. 
These individuals push their abilities beyond the normal 
limits, using what they learn to create new talents that 
they can then teach to others. 
Despite these efforts, duergar still have a limited 
understanding of the true extent of their psionic capa-
bilities. From the perspective of most other creatures, 
such abilities are seen as merely another flavor of magic. 
After all, they reason, what does it matter if a duergar 
turns invisible by using magic or a psionic ability? The 
outcome is the same either way. 
Those duergar who delve into psionic research de-
scribe the process as accessing a dimensional space 
in which they can tap into the energy exerted by living 
minds. Using this power source, a small number of du-
ergar can alter their bodies and those of other creatures, 
tap into thoughts and bend them as they see fit, and 
impart a spark of locomotion and even basic intelligence 
into objects. Duergar of truly exceptional skill can move 
DUERCAR AND ALE 
Unlike their dwarven kin, duergar drink alcohol only in 
moderation and avoid overindulgence. The duergar have 
learned from bitter experience that those who drink too 
much risk awakening deep racial memories of their an-
cestors' cruel treatment at the hands of the mind flayers. 
The psychic agony that these memories evoke manifests 
in a severe flight-or-fight response. An intoxicated duergar 
might flee in panic and search for a safe place to hide 
until the effect wears off. A different one might respond by 
brawling with anyone in the vicinity, venting the rage the 
duergar harbor against their former masters.
