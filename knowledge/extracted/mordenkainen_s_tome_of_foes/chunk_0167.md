GITH 
The descendants of an ancient people- so old their 
original name has been lost- have turned against each 
other, becoming vicious enemies divided over mortality, 
purpose, and the machinations of their leaders. The 
bellicose githyanki terrorize the Astral Plane, raiding 
into other worlds to plunder the multiverse of its magic 
and riches. The githzerai live apart from the rest of the 
cosmos, content within the confines of their fortresses 
floating through the chaos of Limbo. Although the two 
groups of gith despise each other, their hatred for the 
mind flayers from whom they escaped endures, and 
both githyanki and githzerai are dedicated to hunting 
their ancestral foes.
