SORROWSWORN 
The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives 
rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. 
The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that 
are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit 
horror on those who stumble into their midst. 
Emotion Given Form. Each sorrowsworn personifies 
a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are man-
ifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical 
form. Their nature provides a clue both to understand-
ing how they become more powerful and to overcoming 
them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sor-
rowsworn represent causes these entities to grow dead-
lier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them 
and drive them away. 
THE ANGRY 
Relying on violence to sustain their existence, the An-
gry grow more powerful when their foes fight back. If a 
creature opts not to attack, though, the Angry becomes 
confused, and its attacks weaken. Each of the Angry has 
two heads, which bicker with each other until they find 
something else on which they can vent their wrath. 
THE HUNGRY 
Horrid beasts with grasping claws and yawning mouths, 
the Hungry do whatever is necessary to sate their ap-
petites. These greedy devourers consume all life and 
energy they encounter, stuffing their maws with flesh 
and drinking in their victims' screams. When they fin-
ish, they lurch away while their bright eyes resume the 
search for something else to consume. 
THE LONELY 
The sorrow of isolation afflicts many creatures that lurk 
in the Shadowfell, but the need for companionship is 
never manifested more dramatically than in the Lonely. 
When these sorrowsworn spot other creatures, they feel 
keenly the need for interaction and so they launch their 
harpoon-like arms to drag their victims close. 
THE LOST 
The Shadowfell turns visitors around until they become 
marooned in its twisted landscape. The Lost are repre-
sentations of the anxiety and fear that people experience 
when they can't find their way. These sorrowsworn ap-
pear as desperate and panicked things. 
The Lost try to embrace any creatures they can reach, 
attempting to find solace in the contact. Aside from the 
horror of being embraced by such a thing, the victim 
experiences a flood of fear and panic as its mind buckles 
under the fury of this assault. The harder the victims' al-
lies fight for release, the worse the experience becomes. 
THE WRETCHED 
Horrid little monsters, the Wretched gather in large 
packs to scour the Shadowfell for prey. These pitiful en-
tities subsist on life force, so when they find a creature, 
they surge forward to sink their fangs into their victims 
and drink deep of their life energy and their fear.
