DEMONS 
Incarnations of chaos and evil, demons display end-
less variation in appearance and in how they go about 
wreaking havoc across the multiverse. 
ALKILITH 
An alkilith is easily mistaken for some kind of foul fun-
gal growth that appears on doorways, windows, and 
other portals. These dripping infestations conceal the 
demonic nature of the alkilith, making what should be a 
dire warning appear strange but otherwise innocuous. 
Wherever alkiliths take root, they weaken the fabric of 
reality, creating a portal through which even nastier de-
mons can invade. 
Symptoms of Doom. The appearance of an alkilith in 
the world heralds a great wrongness and an imminent 
catastrophe. An alkilith searches for an aperture such 
as a window or a door around which it can take root, 
stretching its body around the opening and anchoring 
itself with a sticky secretion. If left undisturbed, the 
opening becomes attuned to the Abyss and eventually 
becomes a portal to that plane (see "Planar Portals" in 
chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). 
Spawn of]uiblex. Alkiliths spring from the cast-off 
bits ofJuiblex's hideous, shuddering body, then gradu-
ally become self-aware and set out to find their way onto 
the Material Plane. Since most cultists consider them 
too risky for summoning- they can, after all, create 
portals to the Abyss-alkiliths must find other escape 
routes out of their native plane.

Amorphous. The alkilith can move through a space as narrow as 
l inch wide without squeezing. 
False Appearance. While the alkilith is motionless, it is indistin-
guishable from an ordinary slime or fungus. 
Foment Madness. Any creature that isn't a demon that starts 
its turn within 30 feet of the alkilith must succeed on a DC 18 
Wisdom saving throw, or it hears a faint buzzing in its head for 
a moment and has disadvantage on its next attack roll, saving 
throw, or ability check. 
If the saving throw against Foment Madness fails by 5 or 
more, the creature is instead subjected to the confusion spell 
for l minute (no concentration required by the alkilith). While 
under the effect of that confusion, the creature is immune to 
Foment Madness. 
Magic Resistance. The alkilith has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects.

ARMANITE 
Great herds of armanites race across the blasted fields 
of the Abyss, bent on slaughter and death, driven by un-
restrained bloodlust. Whether being controlled by more 
powerful demons or charging into battle for the sake of 
it, armanites use their claws, hooves, and long, whiplike 
tails to tear apart their foes. 
Live for War. In the armies of the demon lords, ar-
manites perform the role of heavy cavalry, leading the 
charge and tearing into their enemies' flanks. Armanites 
fight all the time, even among themselves if they can't 
find another enemy. They make ideal shock troops, cou-
rageous to the point of stupidity and utterly savage. 
Walking Arsenal. Part of what makes armanites so 
fearsome is the number of weapons they have at their 
disposal. They possess sharp hooves, claws that end in
