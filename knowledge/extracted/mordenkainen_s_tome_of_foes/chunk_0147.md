ZARI EL ------
Zariel rules Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. 
Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of 
the Blood War, she succumbed to the plane's corrupting 
influence and fell from grace. She recently reclaimed 
her position as archdevil of Avernus after the cautious 
Bel proved inadequate at marshaling his forces to 
launch offensives against the encroaching demons. Now 
Bel advises her and helps her manage the war, though 
many whisper that her true agenda is vengeance against 
Asmodeus, and her true plan is to drive him from the 
Nine Hells. 
All who enter and exit the Nine Hells must pass 
through Avernus, so the infernal armies muster on this 
layer. Here, the amnizus guard the citadels overlooking 
the River Styx, much of the fighting of the Blood War 
takes place, and devils gather to invade the Abyss. Any-
one hoping to reach the lower layers must first contend

damage (included in the weapon attacks below).

risma (spell save DC 26). She can innately casuhe following 
spells, requiring no material components:

pearance), detect evil and good, fireball, invisibility (self only),

can choose to succeed instead.

against spells and other magical effects. 
CH APTER 6 I BESTIARY 
with the darkness of this layer and the myriad threats it 
houses. Zariel manages it all and has the ultimate say 
over who comes and goes. 
Given her role in the Blood War, Zariel is keenly in-
terested in collecting souls from the greatest warriors 
on the Material Plane and securing their loyalty. She 
bargains hard, and mortals end up worse for dealing 
with her, because she holds all the cards. A bargain with 
Zariel is eternal; there is little hope of wriggling out of 
it. However, she does expect the best from her servants, 
and so she allows her mortal followers to live out their 
lives, ever honing their talents, so she can put them to 
the best use when she finally calls in their debts. As a 
result, Zariel's servants are universally effective, disci-
plined, and dangerous. 
Regeneration. Zariel regains 20 hit points at the start of her 
turn. If she takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at 
the start of her next turn. Zari el dies only if she starts her turn 
with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. Zariel attacks twice with her longsword or with 
her javelins. She can substitute Horrid Touch for one of 
these attacks. 
Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., 
one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) slashing damage, or 19 (2d10 
+ 8) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 36 (8d8) 
fire damage. 
j avelin. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:+ 16 to hit, range 
30/120 ft., one target. Hit: lS (2d6 + 8) piercing damage plus

Horrid Touch (Recharge 5-6). Melee Weapon Attack:+ 16 to hit, 
reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 44 (8dl0) necrotic damage, and 
the target is poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, 
the target is also blinded and deafened. The target can repeat 
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the ef· 
feet on itself on a success. 
Teleport. Zariel magically teleports, along with any equipment 
she is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied 
space she can see. 
L EGEN DARY A CTIO N S

and only at the end of another creature's turn. Zariel regains 
spent legendary actions at the start of her turn. 
Immolating Gaze (Costs 2 Actions). Zariel turns her magical 
gaze toward one creature she can see within 120 feet of her 
and commands it to combust. The target must succeed on a 
DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4dl0) fire damage.
