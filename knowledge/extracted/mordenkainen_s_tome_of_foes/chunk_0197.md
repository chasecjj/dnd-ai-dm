VENOM TRO LL 
VENOM TROLL 
A troll ravaged by massive doses of poison might mutate 
into a venom troll. Lingering poison infuses its blood 
and tissue, and poison leaks from its pores to coat its 
fangs and claws. These creatures are especially danger-
ous in close combat, because poison drips off their flesh 
and sprays out from every wound they receive. 
trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The 
troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't 
regenerate. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The troll makes three attacks: one with its bite 
and two with its claws. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 7 (ld6 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (ld8) poison dam-
age, and the creature is poisoned until the start of the troll's 
next turn. 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach S ft., one target. 
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 4 (ld8) poison damage. 
Venom Spray (Recharge 6). The troll slices itself with a claw, 
releasing a spray of poison in a l 5-foot cube. The troll takes 7 
(2d6) slashing damage (this damage can't be reduced in any 
way). Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) poison 
damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, 
the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. 
A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

C H APTER 6 ( BESTI ARY 
VAMPIRIC MIST 
In billowing clouds of fog lurk vampiric mists, the 
wretched remnants of vampires that were prevented 
from finding rest. Indistinguishable from the mists they 
lurk within, they strike unseen and undetected to bleed 
their victims dry. 
Former Vampires. Vampiric mists, sometimes called 
crimson mists, are all that remain of vampires who 
couldn't return to their burial places after being de-
feated or suffering some mishap. Denied the restorative 
power of these places, the vampires' bodies dissolve into 
mist. The transformation strips the intelligence and per-
sonality from them until only an unholy, insatiable thirst 
for blood remains. 
Blood Thief. Indistinguishable from fog aside from 
the charnel reek it exudes, a vampiric mist descends 
on a creature and causes the blood in its body to ooze 
through the creature's pores or spill out from its eyes, 
nose, and mouth. This blood wafts out from the victim 
like crimson smoke, which the mist then consumes. 
The feeding causes no pain or discomfort to the victim, 
so vampiric mists can feed on sleepers without waking 
them. The more a mist feeds, the redder it gets, such 
that it turns pink, then red, and finally a deep scarlet hue 
tha.t rains blood droplets wherever it goes. 
Attracted to Blood. Like sharks in water, vampiric 
mists can scent blood from up to a mile away. Any in-
jury, no matter how small, might catch their attention 
and draw them toward their victims. In battle, a mist fo-
cuses its attacks on injured targets, since open wounds 
are a more ready source of blood. 
Undead Nature. A vampiric mist doesn't require 
air or sleep. 
Forbiddance. The mist can't enter a residence without an invi-
tation from one of the occupants. 
Misty Form. The mist can occupy another creature's space and 
vice versa. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist 
can pass through it without squeezing. Each foot of movement 
in water costs it 2 extra feet, rather than 1 extra foot. The mist 
can't manipulate objects in any way that requires fingers or 
manual dexterity. 
Sunlight Hypersensitivit y. The mist takes 10 radiant damage 
whenever it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, the 
mist has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. 
ACTIONS 
Life Drain. The mist touches one creature in its space. The 
target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw (un-
dead and constructs automatically succeed), or it takes 10 (2d6 
+ 3) necrotic damage, the mist regains 10 hit points, and the 
target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to 
the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target 
finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is 
reduced to 0.
