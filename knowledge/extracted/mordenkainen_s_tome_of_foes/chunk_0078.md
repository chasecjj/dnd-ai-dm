ties on the surface rarely offer strong defenses against 
attacks from the air. Red dragons ridden by knights 
accompany the vessels, serving as outriders and shock 
trips lo pave the way for the githyanki warriors to de-
scend en masse. 
In battle, the githyanki use mobile tactics combining 
psionics and magic to devastate their foes. They hit 
hard, setting buildings aflame and killing all in their 
path, to foster a panic among their victims that cripples 
any hope of an organized defense. 
Because the githyanki strike to plunder rather than 
conquer, raiders linger over their target for no more than 
a few hours. By daybreak the attackers are gone, pur-
posely leaving behind enough survivors to rebuild the 
ruined community- so that the githyanki might visit the 
place years or decades later and lay it low all over again. 
THE HELM 
To enable them to traverse the skies and travel between 
planes, each githyanki ship is powered by a helm, a 
magical device in the form of a throne-like chair that 
converts psychic energy into motive force. 
THE G ITH ALPHABET 
The gith use a written language composed of alphabetic 
symbols arranged in circular clusters called tir'su. Each 
"spoke" on the wheel corresponds to a letter of the alpha-
bet. Each cluster of characters represents a single word, 
and multiple tir'su connect to form phrases and sentences. 
Githyanki and githzerai both speak Gith, but each race 
has a distinct dialect and accent. Similarly, the two races 
of gith differentiate their language by how they write it. 
Githyanki write a tir'su clockwise, starting at the top. 
Githzerai use the same letter symbols but write their tir'su 
counterclockwise, starting from the bottom. 
CHAPTER 4 I CJTIJ AND THEIR ENDLESS WAR 
A gish, a githyanki who excels as both a warrior and 
a spellcaster, most commonly occupies the helm. A gish 
uses its combination of abilities to pilot the ship and also 
take part in the inevitable battle that awaits the vessel at 
the end of its voyage. The rest of a ship's crew is made 
up of warriors who manage the craft's weapons and 
serve as lookouts. 
ASTRAL SKIFF 
An astral skiff is operated by a crew of three and carries 
up to a dozen passengers. The githyanki employ this 
small vessel, 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, for patrols in 
the Astral Plane and for quick raids in pursuit of specific 
objects on the Material Plane. A skiff has a top speed 
of 15 miles per hour. It lacks weapons aside from those 
carried by its passengers and has a limited amount of 
storage space. 
ASTRAL B RIG 
The astral brig is the standard githyanki military vessel. 
It requires a crew of five and can transport up to sixty 
passengers. A brig is 90 feet long and 30 feet wide, with 
two levels below decks for quarters and storage space. 
It is equipped with two ballistae, each one operated 
by a pair of crew members, and has a top speed of 12 
miles per hour. 
P LANAR RAIDER 
The largest of the githyanki ships, the planar raider 
serves as a mobile headquarters during a major attack 
on the githyanki's enemies. It needs a crew of ten and 
can carry more than a hundred passengers. A planar 
raider can travel up to 12 miles per hour. It is 40 feet 
wide and 120 feet long, with two levels below decks, and 
is equipped with three ballistae and a catapult.
