TABLES

customize certain demons. 
DEMON PERSONALITY TRAITS 
d6 
Trait 
1 
I enjoy telling lies. 
2 
Threats are my only language. 
3 
I fawn over others to make my betrayal more unex-
pected. 
4 
I crush those I can defeat, and lie in wait to weaken 
and overwhelm those I must respect. 
5 
I will do anything to survive. Anything. 
6 
Someday all will worship me. Until then, I track their 
insults with obsessive attention. 
DEMON IDEALS 
d6 
Ideal 
Self-Preservation. It's everything and everyone for 
themselves in this cruel world. 
2 
Might. The world is divided into the strong who rule 
and the weak who obey or die. 
3

if it involves betraying someone.

Strength. Strength is the one coin accepted in all 
realms and by all folk. 
5 
Ambition. We reach the station in the cosmos that we 
deserve due to our drive and talents.

its potential is an empty weapon.

machinations.
