D ROW ARACHNO MANCER 
Drow spellcasters who seek to devote themselves wholly 
to the Spider Queen sometimes walk the dark path of 
the arachnomancer. By offering up body and soul to 
Lolth, they gain tremendous power and a supernatural 
connection to the ancient spiders of the Demonweb Pits, 
channeling magic from that dread place. 
DROW FAVORED CONSORT 
Nearly all priestess es of Lolth, including the powerful 
matron mothers, take attractive drow as their consorts. 
Often these individuals serve no purpose beyond plea-
sure, breeding, or both, but sometimes consorts can 
gain the ear of their priestess and be relied on to provide 
useful advice. No position of consort is assured for long; 
priestesses are infamous for being fickle with their 
favor, which are they are especially glad to lavish on a 
consort who combines beauty with magical might.
