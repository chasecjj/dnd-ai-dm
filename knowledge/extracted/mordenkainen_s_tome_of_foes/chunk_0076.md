obey her willingly. But when they aren't otherwise occu-
pied, many of the citizens of the city spend their time in 
self-indulgent activities. 
For all her seeming invincibility, Vlaakith finds herself 
in an awkward situation that- in her paranoid mind-
has no easy resolution. If she keeps her people busy 
more often by ordering an increase in raids, she risks 
her best warriors and marauders becoming experienced 
and powerful enough to challenge her rule. Also, if she 
sends out too many raiding parties at one time, the 
security of Tu'narath might be compromised. So she ad-
dresses the problem by not dealing with it directly, but 
by trying to encourage her indolent followers to find pur-
pose in meaningful activities that don't involve plunder-
ing and killing. S he isn't always successful in that effort. 
MERCILESS MARAUDERS 
When Vlaakith decrees that another githyanki raid is 
in the offing, Tu'narath comes alive with anticipation. 
The knights and other soldiers selected for the mission 
consider it a high privilege. All the raiders do their best 
to honor Vlaakith by savaging their target- killing crea-
tures indiscriminately, taking whatever treasures catch 
their fancy, and leaving destruction in their wake. 
When one of the githyanki's astral vessels returns 
home after a raid, it is laden with the spoils of the incur-
sion. Vlaakith makes no specific demands but allows 
each individual raider freedom of choice in what they 
bring back. Some might seek exotic spices and herbs, 
while others pillage to find scrolls or tomes of knowl-
edge. As a result, Tu'narath is cluttered (if not crowded) 
by a nearly infinite variety of objects that the githyanki 
have pirated from other planes, ranging in size from 
enormous buildings down to the smallest pieces of ex-
quisite jewelry. 
INDOLENT DILETTANTES 
As a race bred and shaped by the mind flayers for a life 
of fighting, the githyanki never knew anything else while 
they were enslaved. Now that they aren't constantly at 
war, keeping her people occupied is perhaps the great-
est challenge Vlaakith faces. 
When githyanki aren't on raids or other missions for 
Vlaakith, they enjoy a languid existence in Tu'narath. 
Since time doesn't pass on the Astral Plane, the 
githyanki have no need to labor for food or water. To 
keep their minds sharp, Vlaakith orders them to pursue 
a variety of arts and studies. She regularly arranges con-
tests, scavenger hunts, and other trials to keep her ser-
vants involved in purposeful activity, but the attraction 
of such diversions wears off after a brief time. Most of 
the citizens ofTu'narath, when they haven't been called 
for duty on a raid or for some other mission, indulge 
themselves in any way they see fit. 
Githyanki, with an infinite amount of time on their 
hands, crave novelty. They expect every returning raid to 
provide new forms of entertainment. This preoccupation 
with newness stands at the hollow center of githyanki 
culture. They dabble in creating art, but never master 
it. They stand among treasures taken from countless 
worlds but are never truly appreciative of them. The 
githyanki flit from topic to topic, craft to craft, never set-
tling on one endeavor for long. Tu'narath is littered with

half-built sculptures, partially completed frescoes, and 
other unfinished works of all sorts. The githyanki simply 
abandon personal projects that bore them, and every 
such endeavor they undertake ends in this manner. 
A BLADE KEPT SHARP 
Despite the decadent lifestyle the githyanki indulge in, 
they remain in fighting shape. All are required to attend 
weapon and combat drills, which serve as a brief respite 
from their boredom. 
Vlaakith, of course, stands atop the githyanki military 
hierarchy. Under her serve the supreme commanders, 
each of whom oversees a regiment of one thousand 
githyanki warriors. Ten kith'rak, each responsible for a 
company of one hundred, answer to a commander. Each 
kith'rak in turn commands ten sarths, each of whom 
leads a party of ten warriors. A githyanki war leader 
retains that status in times of peace, looking after her 
underlings and maintaining their discipline and com-
bat training. 
KNIGHTS: A BREED APART 
I AM HER WILL MADE MANIFEST. 
I am her unsheathed sword. 
I am a master of dragons. 
I am thefate of all worlds. 
I am a knight of Vlaakith. 
Ever may she reign. 
- Battle hymn of the githyanki knights 
Githyanki knights are warriors, spellcasters, and scouts 
of exceptional ability devoted to the unflagging service 
of Vlaakith. Knights report directly to the queen and 
aren't part of the military hierarchy. The personnel for 
any important mission includes at least one knight, and 
every githyanki fortress or outpost across the multiverse 
is administered by at least one knight in residence. 
Knights are selected for their roles based on their mar-
tial and psionic potential, and young githyanki who pass 
muster are inducted into service soon after they enter 
Tu'narath for the first time. 
Knights are always involved in important decisions, 
and it is forbidden to keep secrets from them. They act 
as commissars and enforcers ofVlaakith's will. They 
are the rough equivalent of religious figures in githyanki 
TH E S POI LS OF WAR 
An individual githyanki's weapons and armor are ornate 
and decorated with trophies taken on raids. With each 
new victory, a warrior brings home a token to serve as a 
~emento. Anything might strike a githyanki's fancy, from a 
Jewel taken from the pommel of a fallen opponent's sword 
to colorful banners taken from a plundered castle that, 
preserved by the timeless nature of the Astral Plane, keep 
their original vibrant hue for centuries. The more baroque 
and ostentatious a raid token is, the more likely it is to be 
admired by one's fellow warriors.
