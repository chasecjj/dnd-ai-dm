Amphibious. The hydroloth can breathe air and water. 
Innate Spellcasting. The hydroloth's innate spellcasting ability 
is Intelligence (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the follow· 
ing spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: darkness, detect magic, dispel magic, invisibility (self 
only), water walk 
3/day each: control water, crown of madness.fear, phantasmal 
killer, suggestion 
Watery Advantage. While submerged in liquid, the hydroloth 
has advantage on attack rolls. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The hydroloth makes two melee attacks. In place 
of one of these attacks, it can cast one spell that takes l ac-
tion to cast. 
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 16 (2dl0 + 5) piercing damage. 
Steal Memory (1/Day). The hydroloth targets one creature it 
can see within 60 feet of it. The target takes 4d6 psychic dam-
age, and it must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. On a 
successful save, the target becomes immune to this hydroloth's 
Steal Memory for 24 hours. On a failed save, the target loses all 
proficiencies, it can't cast spells, it can't understand language, 
and if its Intelligence and Charisma scores are higher than 
s. they become 5. Each time the target finishes a long rest, it 
can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. A greater restoration or remove curse spell cast on the 
target ends this effect early. 
Teleport. The hydroloth magically teleports, along with any 
equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccu· 
pied space it can see. 
.. 
HYDRO LOTH 
Like the thought-stealing waters of the River Styx they 
inhabit, hydroloths filch the memories of creatures they 
attack, stealing away their thoughts for delivery to what-
ever master they happen to s erve. Hydroloths are skilled 
at finding lost things, especially those that have been 
swallowed up in the deeps. 
For amphibious assaults or underwater conflicts, 
hydroloths have no equal among yugoloths. They some-
times hire themselves out to attack and scuttle ships 
and raid coastal settlements. 
MERRENOLOTH 
The grim, gaunt captains of the ferries on the River 
Styx, merrenoloths have total command of their vessels, 
ensuring that their passengers reach their destinations 
safely. Sometimes merrenoloths can be coaxed away 
from the Lower Planes to captain other vessels, afford-
ing those ships and crews the same protection. 
Whenever a merrenoloth takes on a contract to cap-
tain a ship, it bonds with the vehicle to make sure noth-
ing goes awry with it during the journey. A merrenoloth 
can navigate its ship safely through the worst storms, 
always stays on course, and never runs afoul of the myr-
iad hazards that can thwart lesser captains.
