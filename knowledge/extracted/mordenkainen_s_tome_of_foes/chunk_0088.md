How THE FISHSKIPPERS GOT THEIR NAME 
From the gentle waters, 
Amid the swaying reeds, 
There rose a hairy villain, 
A troll called Snobble Sweed. 
He came to gobble children, 
To line his lair with bones, 
And pick his teeth with talons, 
And grind their flesh with stones. 
But on that day ajishing 
Was a haljling brave and true, 
The first of the Fishskippers, 
Grand-kin to me and you. 
When he saw old Snobble Sweed 
A-sharpening his knives, 
He knew that all his family's folk 
Were in danger of their lives. 
In that moment of grave peril, 
Fishskipper caught a bream 
And hurled it by its silvery tail 
Across the glassy stream. 
Ten times the bream did swiftly skip, 
And like a clap of thunder 
It smote old Sweed upon his head, 
And tore the beast asunder. 
-"Tale of the Fishskippers," by Harkin Fishskipper 
Keeping History Alive. The halflings' penchant for 
storytelling has another outlet, in the form of gatherings 
in which an elder holds court or several tale-tellers try 
to outdo one another as they pass on their experiences. 
Witnessing a halfling storytelling session is a rare treat 
for an outsider, for halfting elders can spin a yarn like 
no one else. A tale with all the trappings told by an elder 
can cause listeners to howl with laughter, long for home, 
sit on the edges of their seats, dream of far-off shores, 
choke up with emotion, or smile from ear to ear. 
Some of the most often-told tales concern the origin 
of a halfling clan's name. Generally, such appellations 
come about because in the distant past, a halfting ma-
triarch or patriarch performed a memorable feat or dis· 
played some amazing skill that led to a name that stuck. 
Clans with evocative names such as the Cavecrawlers, 
the Hogtrotters, and the Fishskippers all have a story to 
be told about how they came to be. 
HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT 
Although halflings aren't reclusive by nature, they 
are adept at finding out-of-the-way places to settle in. 
It takes a combination of luck and persistence for an 
ordinary traveler to find such a place, and often that's 
not enough. For those who subscribe to the idea that 
Yondalla actively shields her worshipers from harm, 
this phenomenon is easily explained-she looks out for 
their homes just as she protects their lives. Whatever 
the reason, travelers might look for a halfling village, but 
they fail to notice a narrow path that cuts through the 
underbrush, or they find themselves traveling in circles 
and getting no closer to their goal. Rangers who have 
encountered halflings or lived among them know of this 
effect, and they learn to trust their other senses and 
their instincts rather than relying on sight. 
A typical halfling village is a cluster of small, stone 
houses with thatched roofs and wooden doors, or bur-
rows dug into hillsides with windows that look out onto 
gardens of flowers, beans or potatoes. Since a halfling 
community usually has less than a hundred members, 
cooperation is critical to their society, and each resident 
performs regular chores or offers benefits that support 
the population. One family might provide baked goods, 
while another one cobbles shoes or knits clothing. Gen-
erally, halflings in a village don't produce goods for sale 
to outsiders, but they do love to trade, especially with 
visitors who have interesting items to swap. 
Life of Leisure. Halftings rarely consider leaving the 
security of their villages, because they already have all 
the comforts they could want- food, drink, laughter, 
family, friends, and the satisfaction of doing a good day's 
work. When all their necessities have been taken care 
of, halftings take it easy- and many of them find a way 
to turn idleness into an art form. Every halfting has a 
favorite spot for doing nothing- in the shade of a large 
stone, on the fringe of a sun-dappled meadow, or nestled 
in a comfy crook high in a tree. When they're not dozing 
off and dreaming of chasing butterflies, halflings spend 
time on simple creative activities, such as whittling a 
pipe from a branch, braiding yarn into a thick rope, or 
composing a jaunty tune on a second-hand mandolin. 
Serious Business. The oldest members of a half· 
ling community are its leaders, although that role has
