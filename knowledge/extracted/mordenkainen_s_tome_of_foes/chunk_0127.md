REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing Graz'zt's lair is warped by his 
magic, creating one or more of the following effects: 
• Flat surfaces within 1 mile of the lair that are made 
of stone or metal become highly reflective, as though 
polished to a shine. These surfaces become supernat-
urally mirrorlike. 
• Wild beasts within 6 miles of the lair break into fre-
quent conflicts and coupling, mirroring the behavior 
that occurs during their mating seasons. 
• If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile 
of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 
Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness 
determined by the Madness of Graz'zt table. A 
creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be 
affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours. 
If Graz'zt dies, these effects fade over the course of 
ldlO days.
