C H APTER 6 I BESTIA RY 
ZUGGTMOY 
The Demon Queen of Fungi, Lady of Rot and Decay, 
Zuggtmoy is an alien creature whose only desire is to 
infect the living with spores, transforming them into her 
mindless servants and, eventually, into decomposing 
hosts for the mushrooms, molds, and other fungi that 
she spawns. 
Utterly inhuman, Zuggtmoy can mold her fungoid 
form into an approximation of a humanoid shape, in-
cluding the skeletal-thin figure depicted in grimoires 
and ancient art, draped and veiled in mycelia and lichen. 
Indeed, much of her appearance and manner, and that 
of her servants, is a soulless mockery of mortal life and 
its many facets. 
Zuggtmoy's cultists often follow her unwittingly. Most 
are fungi-infected to some degree, whether through 
inhaling her mind-controlling spores or being trans-
formed to the point where flesh and fungus become 
one. Such cultists are fungal extensions of the Demon 
Queen's will. Their devotion might begin with the seem-
ingly harmless promises offered by exotic spores and 
mushrooms, but quickly consumes them, body and soul. 
ZUGGTMOY's L AIR 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Zuggtmoy's principal lair is her palace on Shedaklah. 
It consists of two dozen mushrooms of pale yellow and 
rancid brown. These massive fungi are some of the larg-
est in existence. They are surrounded by a field of acidic 
puffballs and poisonous vapors. The mushrooms are all 
interconnected by bridges of shelf-fungi, and countless 
chambers have been hollowed out inside their rubbery, 
fibrous stalks. 
LAIR ACTIONS 
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), 
Zuggtmoy can take a lair action to cause one of the 
following effects; she can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row: 
• Zuggtmoy causes four gas spores or violet fungi 
(see the Monster Manual) to appear in unoccupied 
spaces that she chooses within the lair. They vanish 
after 1 hour. 
• Up to four plant creatures that are friendly to Zuggt-
moy and that Zuggtmoy can see can use their re-
actions to move up to their speed and make one 
weapon attack. 
• Zuggtmoy uses either her Infestation Spores or her 
Mind Control Spores, centered on a mushroom or 
other fungus within her lair, instead of on herself. 
REGIONAL EFFECTS 
The region containing Zuggtmoy's lair is warped by her 
magic, creating one or more of the following effects: 
• Molds and fungi grow on surfaces within 6 miles 
of the lair, even where they would normally find 
no purchase. 
• Plant life within 1 mile of the lair becomes in-
fested with parasitic fungi, slowly mutating as it is 
overwhelmed. 


--- Page 158 ---

• If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile 
of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 
Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness 
determined by the Madness of Zuggtmoy table. A 
creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be 
affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours. 
If Zuggtmoy dies, these effects fade over the course of 
ldlO days. 
MADNESS OF ZUGGTMOY 
If a creature goes mad in Zuggtmoy's lair or within 
line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of 
Zuggtmoy table to determine the nature of the madness, 
which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the 
Du11geon Master's Guide for more on madness.

on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood crea-
ture in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must 
make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, 
the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On 
a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the 
spores ofZuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness 
(determined by rolling on the Madness ofZuggtmoy table) that 
lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While in-
fected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must 
repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending 
the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's 
body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such 
failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore 
servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" 
entry in the Monster Manual). 
Mind Control Spores (Recharge 5- 6). Zuggtmoy releases 
spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius 
sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Humanoids 
and beasts in the cloud when it appears, or that enter it later, 
must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful 
save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 
hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease 
called the influence ofZuggtmoy for 24 hours. While infected 
in this way, the creature is charmed by her and can't be 
reinfected by these spores. 
REACTIONS 
Protective Thrall. When Zuggtmoy is hit by an attack, one 
creature within 5 feet ofZuggtmoy that is charmed by her must 
use its reaction to be hit by the attack instead.
