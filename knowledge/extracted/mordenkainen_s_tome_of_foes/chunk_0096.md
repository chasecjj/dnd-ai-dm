Forest gnome settlements often escape notice. Roving 
hunters can wander through without ever suspecting 
they are walking through anything but wilderness. A 
community of elves might be surprised to discover they 
have been neighbors of a forest gnome village for years. 
Forest gnomes are good at making their homes vanish 
into the landscape. It helps that they are small folk, and 
that they fashion their homes by digging down and liv-
ing within rather than building up and living above. Like 
the badgers and raccoons that are often their compan-
ions, they live in the hollows of trees and warrens dug 
into hillsides, each home connected to the others in the 
community by elaborate burrows. 
Beyond the secret doors into their houses, the homes 
of forest gnomes are gaily decorated, tidy spaces that 
take advantage of natural features. A great glass bowl 
swimming with fish and frogs might serve as a skylight 
for a gnome burrow, while appearing to the world above 
as a small pond. The gnarled and tangled roots of a tree 
might be used for shelves, seats, tables, and bed spaces. 
Such houses often have many little channels open to 
the outside, allowing scraps of sunlight to dapple the 
walls and floors and providing a means of egress for the 
many animals that live with the gnomes. Similar small 
openings are used for their cleverly hidden chimneys, 
disguised as tree branches, which carry smoke from 
their small fires high into the treetops, reducing it to lit-
tle more than a haze before it disperses. 
ANIMAL HELPERS 
Forest gnomes can communicate with many of the 
small animals of the woods. Squirrels, raccoons, foxes, 
weasels, owls, rabbits, robins, hummingbirds, and more 
are their allies and friends. Outsiders often think of 
these creatures as the gnomes' pets, but the gnomes 
treat them more like trusted neighbors. 
When strangers approach a woodland inhabited by 
forest gnomes, the gnomes often know about it while 
such visitors are still miles away. Speedy squirrels run 
through the treetops, each trying to be the first to warn 
the gnomes and earn a sweet treat. Birds trill a special 
call that alerts the gnomes to danger. At night, nocturnal 
animals such as owls and bats carry word to the gnomes 
during times when they should be on their guard. 
EXPERTS IN ILLUSION 
Forest gnomes have innate magical ability, letting them 
create simple illusions. They practice the use of illusion 
magic from an early age. Most forest gnome communi-
ties include a full-fledged illusionist and an apprentice or 
two, and they use their talents in service of the commu-
nity- designing longer-lasting or larger-scale illusions 
that help the community stay hidden from the world. 
Gnomes use illusions for practically any reason- as 
a game, for defense, or for communication- and some-
times for no reason other than artistic considerations. A 
simple illusion can often express a complex idea, such 
as when the memory of a location is triggered by the 
illusory sound of a babbling brook that runs through 
the place. A storytelling session conducted by a group of 
forest gnomes is a riot of sounds and images that helps 
give meaning and intensity to the tale being told. It is 
a kind of entertainment unfathomable by most other 
races, whose stories and performances are limited by 
whatever materials are on hand. 
The forest gnomes' playful nature shows through in 
the illusions they create, even those that have a seri-
ous purpose. (An illusion that conceals the entrance 
to a tunnel by making it look like solid earth might not 
amuse other folk, but the gnomes get a good laugh out 
of it.) Forest gnomes spend their spare time experiment-
ing with the creation of never-before-seen illusions, or 
embellishing the images and sounds they already know 
how to produce. 
The number of ways in which forest gnomes use illu-
sions to have fun is nearly limitless. A few examples: vi-
sual enhancements to a mythic tale told by an elder, new 
and interesting sounds, and false doors and hallways 
to fool intruders and lead them into traps. (Goblins just 
can't pass by a door that calls them names.) 
DEEP GNOMES 
Deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, are the pragmatic and of-
ten grumpy cousins of the gnome family, who live deep 
underground. The Underdark is full of danger, meaning 
that deep gnomes spend much of their time simply stay-
ing alive. They endure this life because the Underdark 
also holds incredible treasures: minerals and gem-
stones, gold, silver, and platinum. The svirfneblin mine 
these materials whenever they find a new deposit-espe-
cially rubies, which they prize above all other treasure. 
The svirfneblin do take pleasure from success in these 
mining operations. A thin smile emerges from the stone-
like features of a deep gnome who finds a truly remark-
able gem, and such a discovery lightens the mood in the 
enclave for a time.
