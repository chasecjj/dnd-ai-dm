DROW HOUSE CAPTAIN 
Each drow noble house entrusts the leadership of its 
military forces to a house captain, a position normally 
held by the matriarch's first or second son. The house 
captain commands the drow and slaves making up the 
family's army and has made extensive study of strategy 
and tactics to become an effective leader in battle. 
DROW I NQUISITOR 
-----
Drow expect treachery. After all, the Spider Queen 
encourages it. A certain amount of backstabbing and 
double-crossing can be managed, but too much can 
undermine an entire community. To keep some sem-
blance of order and to root out traitors, drow priestesses 
employ inquisitors. Chosen from the ranks of the priest-
hood, these female drow possess authority equaled only 
by the matrons of the noble houses. Anyone they decide 
is at odds with the hierarchy faces torture and usually 
an excruciating death. 
VARIANT: YOCHLOL SUMMONINC 
Some drow inquisitors have an action that allows them to 
summon a demon. 
Summon Demon (1 / Day). The drow attempts to magi-
cally summon a yochlol, with a SO percent chance of suc-
cess. If the attempt fails, the drow takes 5 (ldlO) psychic 
damage. Otherwise, the summoned demon appears in an 
unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as 
an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. 
It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or 
until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
