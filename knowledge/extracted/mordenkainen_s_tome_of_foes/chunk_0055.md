SA HUAGIN: DA NG ER FROM T HE DEPT H S 
The sea elves face as many perils in their watery world as 
other elves face on dry land, but none are as deadly as the 
sahuagin. The animosity between these two races stems 
from the sahuagin's ferocious territoriality. They simply 
won't abide any other intelligent society, and they consider 
the entire sea to be their domain. 
Adding to the tension, the sahuagin worship Sekolah, 
the shark god, while Deep Sashelas, the sea deity of the 
elves, is a sworn enemy of all sharks. But even if the sea 
elves inexplicably began worshiping Sekolah, the sahuagin 
still wouldn't be able to get along with them-in the grip 
of a blood frenzy, sahuagin will tear apart even others of 
their own kind! 
SHADAR- KAI TRAITS 
Shadar-kai have the following traits in common, in addi-
tion to the traits they share with other elves. 
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score in-
creases by 1. 
Necrotic Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic 
damage. 
Blessing of the Raven Queen. As a bonus action, you 
can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied 
space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do 
so again until you finish a long rest. 
Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all 
damage when you teleport using this trait. The resis-
tance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that 
time, you appear ghostly and translucent.

CHAPTER 2 I ELVES 
DROW ADVENTURER STORY HOOKS 
d8 
Hook 
You overheard members of your own house plotting 
to poison you, so you fled from the Underdark to 
save yourself. You won't return until you've amassed 
enough fortune to surround yourself with loyal mer-
cenary bodyguards. 
2 
You were enslaved as punishment for trying to poison 
an influential rival, but you escaped and fled to the 
surface. If you return to the Underdark and are cap-
tured, you'll be re-enslaved. 
3 
You were the lover of a high-ranking priestess of Lolth 
as a means of enhancing your status. When she tired 
of you, the loss of status was humiliating, so you left. 
4 
You killed a drow from a more powerful house in 
a duel over a public insult. The slain drow's house 
vowed to destroy your house unless you were handed 
over. Your kin urged you to leave the Underdark. You 
wonder what became of them. 
5 
A close friend of yours was revealed to be a worshiper 
of Eilistraee. Suspicion fell on everyone in her circle. 
Running was a tacit admission of guilt, even though 
you knew nothing about it, but you'd have been sacri· 
ficed to Lolth if you stayed. 
6 
You were among a group of surface raiders that was 
ambushed, and you were captured. During years of 
captivity, you learned that most of what Lolth's priest-
esses taught about the outer world was lies. Now 
7 
8 
you're experiencing the truth for yourself. 
All your life, you were alienated and terrified by the 
cruelty of your kin. The first chance you got, you vol-
unteered to go on a surface raid, then deserted the 
group and remained behind. Now you're hated and 
feared wherever you go, but at least you've found a 
small group of adventurous friends who trust and 
support each other. 
You were part of a delegation carrying diplomatic 
messages to another drow city when duergar attacked 
the caravan for slaves and treasure. Only you and one 
other guard escaped. If you'd returned home, you'd 
have been poisoned or worse for failure. Becoming a 
mercenary was your best option.
