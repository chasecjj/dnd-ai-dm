hasn't slowed down since. 
CH1\l'TER 5 I HALF LI NGS AND GNOMES 
GNOMES 
AND THEN THE WHOLE T H ING EXPLODED INTO A MILLION 
jillion pieces! {gasp] I never saw anything like it in my life! 
- Griballix, gnome of Sigil 
Love of discovery is the force that drives the life of a 
gnome, whether one is investigating the nature of magic 
or trying to invent a better back scratcher. Questions 
about the world fill a gnome's head: how an insect flies, 
a fish swims, or a grasshopper jumps- they want to 
figure it all out! But it's not just nature and its workings 
that intrigue them; gnomes become obsessed with all 
sorts of topics. In particular, they have a keen interest in 
mechanical devices, the natural world, and magical pur-
suits; a gnome might seek to invent a new garden tool, 
collect and categorize every type of butterfly, or develop 
a new method for cutting gemstones. 
DRINKING DEEPLY OF LIFE 
A gnome is rarely bored and tries to savor every minute, 
for life is full of opportunities to learn, to help others, 
and to have fun. 
Gnomes are born with a fascination for learning fu-
eled by an irrepressible curiosity. Most individuals settle 
on a specialized area of study such as an aspect of the 
natural world, a particular method of invention, or the 
patterns that underlie the multiverse. 
Though this pursuit of knowledge might compel a 
gnome to spend long periods in the workshop or the lab-
oratory, the activity is never seen as drudgery-quite the 
opposite. Gnomes enjoy making an unexciting aspect 
of life more enjoyable, such as inventing a shovel that 
whistles a tune to lighten the toil of digging, or creating 
a telescoping fork that can reach across the table to en-
liven mealtime. 
Their fun-loving attitude also comes through in the 
form of jokes that gnomes tell to, or about, their com-
panions, and in the good-spirited pranks that they play 
on each other-and on other folk (who might not always 
appreciate being the target of their humor). 
n m JOURNEY IS T H E D ESTINATION 
Gnomes aren't overly goal-oriented as they pursue their 
interests. To them, the journey and the destination are 
one and the same, and an achievement at the end of 
one journey is merely the first step toward the next ac-
complishment. 
Even though failure, disappointment, and dead ends 
are recurring obstacles on the path to discovery, gnomes 
revel in the search. They savor the acquisition of new 
knowledge, realizing it might come at a cost, and even a 
series of bad results in experiments doesn't dissuade a 
gnome from following their chosen path. 
ROCK GNOMES 
A visitor's first steps into a rock gnome warren are ac-
companied by the sounds of industry- hammers rapping 
on metal, chisels chewing wood, cauldrons bubbling, 
and a host of assorted squeaks, pings, and whistles. 
Against this backdrop, the halls echo with the voices of
