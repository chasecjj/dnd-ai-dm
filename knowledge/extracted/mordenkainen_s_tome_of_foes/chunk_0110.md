CORPSE FLOWER 
A corpse flower can sprout atop the grave of 
an evil necromancer or the remains of power-
ful undead. Unless it is uprooted and burned 
while it is still a seedling, the corpse flower 
grows to enormous size over several weeks, 
then tears itself free of the earth and begins 
scavenging humanoid corpses from battle-
fields and graveyards. Using its fibrous ten-
tacles, it stuffs the remains into its body and 
feeds on carrion to repair itself. The plant has 
a malevolent bent and despises the living. 
Horrible Odor. With or without humanoid 
corpses nested in its body, a corpse flower 
exudes a stench of decay that can overwhelm 
the senses of nearby creatures, causing them 
to become nauseated. The stench, which 
serves as a defense mechanism, fades 2d4 
days after the corpse flower dies.

Corpses. When first encountered, a corpse flower contains the 
corpses of ld6 + 3 humanoids. A corpse flower can hold the 
remains of up to nine dead humanoids. These remains have 
total cover against attacks and other effects outside the corpse 
flower. If the corpse flower dies, the corpses within it can be 
pulled free. 
While it has at least one humanoid corpse in its body, 
the corpse flower can use a bonus action to do one of the 
following: 
• The corpse flower digests one humanoid corpse in its body 
and instantly regains 11 (2dl0) hit points. Nothing of the 
digested body remains. Any equipment on the corpse is ex-
pelled from the corpse flower in its space. 
• The corpse flower animates one dead humanoid in its body, 
turning it into a zombie. The zombie appears in an unoccu-
pied space within 5 feet of the corpse flower and acts imme· 
diately after it in the initiative order. The zombie acts as an 
ally of the corpse flower but isn't under its control, and the 
flower's stench clings to it (see the Stench of Death trait). 
Spider Climb. The corpse flower can climb difficult surfaces, 
including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 
Stench of Death. Each creature that starts its turn within 10 
feet of the corpse flower or one of its zombies must make a DC 
14 Constitution saving throw, unless the creature is a construct 
or undead. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated 
until the end of the turn. Creatures that are immune to poison 
damage or the poisoned condition automatically succeed on 
this saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune 
to the stench of all corpse flowers for 24 hours. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The corpse flower makes three tentacle attacks. 
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one tar-
get. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target must 
succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) 
poison damage . 
Harvest the Dead. The corpse flower grabs one unsecured 
dead humanoid within 10 feet of it and stuffs the corpse into 
itself, along with any equipment the corpse is wearing or carry· 
ing. The remains can be used with the Corpses trait.
