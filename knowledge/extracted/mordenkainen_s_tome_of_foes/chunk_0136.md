(2d10) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The 
poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each 
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. 
A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of 
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a crea-
ture's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the 
creature is immune to the abishai's Frightful Presence for the 
next 24 hours. 
Incite Fanaticism. The abishai chooses up to four of its al-
lies within 60 feet of it that can see it. For 1 minute, each of 
those allies makes attack rolls with advantage and can't be 
frightened. 
Power of the Dragon Queen. The abishai targets one dragon it 
can see within 120 feet ofit. The dragon must make a DC 18 
Charisma saving throw. A chromatic dragon makes this save 
with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune 
to the abishai's Power of the Dragon Queen for 1 hour. On 
a failed save, the target is charmed by the abishai for 1 hour. 
While charmed in this way, the target regards the abishai as a 
trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if 
the abishai or its companions deal damage to the target.
