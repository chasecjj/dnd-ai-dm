standing of their origin and a firmer grasp of magic, and 
some enjoy a lingering telepathic connection with others 
who have been initiated into the Mysteries. 
Cryptic shrines to the Mysteries of Arvandor appear 
throughout the planes, mostly sites where carved or 
painted stars cover the ceiling of a cave. On the planes 
that have hosted one of these rare events, elf priests con-
secrate and maintain temples devoted to the Mysteries. 
Often these sacred sites are natural spaces that have 
intrinsic magical properties. 
Stories about the Mysteries are preached by many 
theologians as examples of Corellon's abiding love for 
his wayward children. Some sages imagine that, one 
day, all elves will be given this opportunity, after Corel-
lon is satisfied by the completion of some great cosmic 
quest, and elves will once again be a people of unfet-
tered form and unimaginable joy. 
H ANALI CELANIL 
Hanali is the elven god of beauty and love. Usually de-
picted as a beautiful female, in some stories the god ap-
pears to mortals as a gorgeous male. Hanali's gender in 
a story seldom matters, for no matter how much heart-
ache and confusion the stories contain, they end with 
affairs of the heart properly sorted out and everyone in 
love with the person, or persons, they were fated to be 
with. Stories of Hana I i's romantic adventures among 
elves and other mortals are perennial favorites when 
sung by elf bards and poets. 
In Arvandor, Hanali maintains a hidden pool called 
Evergold. She bathes in it at least once a day. It's said 
that the water of Evergold keeps her young and breath-
takingly beautiful, but this is certainly a poetic myth, 
since all the Seldarine appear young and beautiful, with 
or without having bathed in this fountain. Mortal elves 
who are invited to join Hana Ii in the pool are said to 
retain their youthfulness and to delay the onset of Tran-
scendence by at least a century. More than a few elves 
claim to have experienced this benefit, and the truth of 
it is attested by many bards- sometimes in all earnest-
ness, sometimes with a knowing wink. 
Priests of Hanali perform weddings between elves 
and preside over most other family-related ceremonies. 
Other than nuptials and a spate of spring celebrations, 
the priests conduct few observances. 
Pools of Beauty. Those who worship Hanali Celani! 
build shrines in her honor around natural pools of clear 
spring water- a representation of the purity and power 
of Evergold. Her priests often surround such an area 
with flowers or arrange stones in a way that accentuates 
the natural beauty of the place. In a shrine dedicated to 
the worship of several elven deities, an alabaster bowl of 
water, usually with yellow flowers or petals floating in it, 
is left in reverence to Hanali. 
Hanali's pool is a symbol of rejuvenation, and its water 
has significance as well in representing the ever-flowing 
force of love. To Hana I i's followers, love is a living thing 
that flows like a river, moving around obstacles with 
ease, and, if it must. carving a path through bedrock to 
reach the sea of unity where all love gathers to become 
one with the cosmos. As one would navigate a river, the 
faithful of Hanali are known for following their hearts, 
unwilling to deviate from the pursuit of ultimate beauty. 
Devotees of Hanali Celanil are known for taking the 
initiative in beautifying their surroundings without ask-
ing or expecting others to follow suit. If a shrine to the 
gods is beginning to look somewhat untidy, her follow-
ers will straighten things up, bring fresh flowers, and 
refresh offerings of food, water, and wine. Especially 
vigilant individuals might even decide to clean up after 
others who carelessly spill a drink in a tavern or leave 
their dinner table in a slovenly condition, all in humble 
service to their god. 
LABELAS ENOR ETH 
Even though elves live far longer than most other hu-
manoids, they show few physical signs of aging until 
they become very old. By the time an elf's hair turns to 
silver and wrinkles appear around the eyes, the elf has 
lived for centuries and probably has only a few decades 
remaining. For this longevity and long-lasting vitality, 
they thank and revere Labelas Enoreth. 
Labelas is portrayed as an elderly elf with silver hair, 
still-active eyes that once were bright blue but now are 
clouded and gray, fine wrinkles around the eyes and 
mouth. and a right hand slightly impaired by the effects 
of age. If anything, these symptoms of mortality make 
the god even more handsome and stately in the eyes of 
his followers than he was in his youth. 
Elves tend to give Labelas little regard until they ex-
perience Remembrance. Like Corellon and Hanali, La-
belas makes few demands on his followers. A few min-
utes each day spent thanking him for his gift of long life 
and good health, and occasionally placing a fresh flower 
in one of his shrines, is generally all that's expected. 
When an elf develops unusual ailments in old age and 
appears headed for decrepitude, other elves might won-
der if these are the repercussions for not paying Labelas 
his due. 
Most settlements have only one or two priests of La-
bel as. These individuals are elves well past their prime
