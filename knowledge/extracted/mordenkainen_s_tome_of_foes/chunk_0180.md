SALAMANDER, FROST 
Frost salamanders are natives of the Plane of Ice, also 
called the Frostfell, which rests between the Plane of 
Air and the Plane of Water. Frost salamanders espe-
cially like to hunt warm-blooded creatures. They some-
times travel to frigid climes on the Material P lane by 
wandering through planar gates. 
Devourers of Heat. The frost salamanders' aggres-
sion appetite for any heat source leads them to attack 
settlements they come across. They might mistake 
the fire of a forge or a campfire for a large, tasty meal, 
drawing them to attack expeditions and settlements that 
other predators would avoid. Azers sometimes venture 
into the Frostfell, where they use large fires to Jure frost 
salamanders into traps to kill them and collect their 
hides and fangs for use in crafting weapons and armor. 
False Refuge. Although frost salamanders can bur-
row their way through loose soil, they prefer to dig into 
the ice. They roll around in piles of broken chunks of ice, 
allowing it to scratch their backs as they grind it down. 
This habit leads them to create extensive networks of ice 
caves, becoming ever larger as they claw fresh chunks 
of ice from the walls of their lairs. 
A frost salamander that dwells in a lair for a while 
carves out enough space to allow a small army to camp 
within. Inexperienced travelers who come across these 
caves see them as a welcome shelter, though they are 
anything but. Frost salamanders greedily devour any 
prey foolhardy enough to try sleeping in their lairs. 
On rare occasions, frost giants capture and tame 
these creatures, using them to burrow into the ice to 
help create outposts and fortresses.
