vading demons. Also, the prospect of a permanent death 
compels the devils fighting on Avernus to maintain the 
utmost readiness and coordination. Wounded devils 
retreat, knowing that fresh reinforcements can continue 
the fight. Hordes of lemures, devils that are permanently 
destroyed only if subjected to holy energies, are used 
to blunt demonic incursions. The terrain of Avernus is 
thoroughly mapped and festooned with ambush points, 
strongholds, and other defensive measures. 
More important, demons that are slain and sent back 
to the Abyss return to their chaotic wanderings in that 
realm. A demon lord is thus hard pressed to keep a 
horde cohesive as it takes casualties. If the devils ex-
tended a tenacious defense out to the planes beyond 
Avernus, they could keep the demons away from Hell's 
doorstep, but such a strategy would place a great strain 
on supplies, reinforcements, and unit integrity. Although 
the devils kmed in such places would recover, their 
weapons, armor, and other materials would remain lost. 
THE DEVILISH POINT OF VIEW 
MY LEGIONS ARE THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN 
yow· precious Seven Heavens and the bottomless hunger 
of the Abyss. I did not fall into the clutches of evil. I rose to 
shoulder a cosmic burden. 
-Zariel, Archduchess of Avernus, 
former angel of Celestia 
Although the basic facts of the Blood War aren't subject 
to debate, a host of theories exist that attempt to explain 
why the conflict erupted in the first place. 
The devils fight as a matter of pride mixed with burn-
ing resentment for a cosmic order that refuses to ac-
knowledge their role as overseers of the multiverse. 
LEGIONS OF THE DAMNED 
Most of the forces of the Nine Hells are grouped into 
three types of legions that each play a role in repelling the 
invading demons. Incompetent or weak devils fill out the 
dreg legions, composed mainly of hordes of lemures and 
nupperibos. They are deployed as a delaying tactic, serving 
as fodder to slow down an advancing horde of demons 
while sword legions organize their counterattacks and 
shield legions establish their defenses. Each legion within 
a category has a distinctive, fearsome-sounding name in 
the Infernal tongue. When translated into Common, these 
names are often descriptive of the legion's status or bat-
tle-worthiness, such as the ones given below. 
Dreg Legions. Bugs in the System, Momentary Lapse of 
Progress, Casualties Imminent, Last in Line for Healing, 
Not Worth the Effort 
Shield Legions. Moment of Silence, Welcome to the 
Hells, Pleased to Meet You, Front toward Enemy, End 
of the Line 
Sword Legions. Flawless Execution, Damned Good, The 
Hanging Blade, Inevitable Outcome, A Taste for Carnage 
To the devils' way of thinking, the Nine Hells are the 
front line in the demons' war against all of creation, 
and the fate of the cosmos depends on the devils' abil-
ity to blunt the invasion and send the demons back to 
the Abyss. 
In fact, devils believe that the demons would have long 
ago swept across the multiverse but for the unflinching 
rule of law that underlies the actions of the infernal lead-
ers and their armies. If necessary, a general must not 
hesitate to sacrifice entire legions to stall an enemy ad-
vance or punch a hole through an enemy phalanx. Iron 
discipline combined with a ruthless focus on victory at 
any cost is what fuels the devils' war machine. 
Every devil takes a grim pride in its service in the 
Blood War. Talk to one for a short time, and it will reveal
