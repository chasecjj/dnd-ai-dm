STEEDERS 
Giant hunting spiders, steeders prowl the depths of the 
Underdark. Most steeders are encountered in the com-
pany of duergar. 
Female Dominance. Female steeders grow larger 
and stronger than males, and the female often devours 
the male after breeding. In captivity, males are used as 
draft animals, while females serve as steeds in battle. 
Lone Predators. Steeders consider other steeders 
as enemies and attempt to tear apart perceived threats. 
Their duergar handlers must stable steeders separate 
from one another and place blinders on 
them when they're put to work to keep 
them from attacking each other. 
Low Cunning. Steeders are intelligent 
enough to learn simple hand signals and 
vocal commands, but even a domesticated 
steeder can turn against its handler. 
Training these beasts requires a rider 
to bond with the steeder, a process that 
begins shortly after the creature hatches. 
The rider stays with the steeder as it 
grows to full size, working throughout 
that time to channel the beast's predatory 
instincts. 
Deadly Hunters. Rather than spinning 
webs, steeders excrete a viscous sub-
stance from their legs. This goo allows 
them to creep along walls and ceilings 
and to grapple prey.
