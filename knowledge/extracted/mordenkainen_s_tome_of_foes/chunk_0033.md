sider killing to be just another tool for resolving disputes 
and clearing the way for social advancement. 
Property crimes such as theft are usually considered 
evidence of significant character flaws, because elves 
don't value material goods as highly as shorter-lived 
races do. An item's intrinsic value is secondary to its 
historical and sentimental value, which can be consid-
erable. An elf who steals a pouch full of gems would be 
pitied, but someone who steals a dried flower presented 
to an elf by her long-gone sister would be seen as a mon-
ster and likely exiled from the community. 
PASSION VS. RESTRAIN..!__ 
The elven personality is a mixture of two opposing 
forces, which vie for dominance throughout an elf's life. 
How an elf handles the tension between passion and 
restraint colors their life experiences. 
When they're young, elves approach life with great en-
thusiasm. Their joy is as intense as roaring flame, their 
sadness as deep as the sea. They dive into endeavors 
with seemingly inexhaustible energy, yet they typically 
do so without much display of emotion. 
The reserve and patience of elves is well known 
among other races, but what a dwarf or a human doesn't 
see is the conflict taking place inside an elf's mind. 
Elves keep their passion internalized because they learn 
at a young age that such feelings can become destruc-
tive when they are allowed to take control. Elves who 
let passion overtake their behavior can be consumed by 
it. They stop caring about friendships, alienate family 
members, and take foolish risks in pursuit of gratifica-
tion that a cooler head would never hazard. 
This passion wanes as an elf ages, but it never disap-
pears entirely. One of the most important responsibili-
ties of elder elves is teaching youngsters the danger of 
letting their passions loose and showing them how to 
develop a long-lasting self-discipline. 
PRIMEVAL HATRED 
One of the most fervent passions in an elf is the animos-
ity that surface elves and drow hold for one another. 
This hatred dates back to when the primal elves surren-
dered their mutable forms in response to Lolth's prom-
ises. They split into two factions: the drow, who believed 
that Corellon had held them back and that Lolth's be-
trayal was justified, and a.II other elves, who felt bereft of 
Corellon's presence and believed Lolth had manipulated 
them from the very beginning. To the drow, every elf 
who basks in Corellon's light is a weakling and a fool. To 
most other elves, every drow is a traitor. 
Despite the rift between them, drow and other elves 
can deal with each other when necessary, avoiding 
violence for the sake of a common ca.use. They won't 
like it- they might even hate themselves for a time after-
ward- but they'll do what must be done according to the 
circumstances of the situation. 
Some elves do manage to transcend this hatred. They 
have met or heard of dark elves, like Drizzt Do'Urden, 
who find their own paths in life and view each elf as an 
individual, not as the representative of one side or the 
other in a cosmic struggle. 
ELF ADVENTURERS 
Most surface elves embark on a period of adventuring 
during their early adulthood. An adventure to an elf, 
however, isn't always the same as what humans mean 
when they think of adventure. Humans tend to equate 
adventurers with people who battle monsters, explore 
dangerous ruins, delve into deep caverns, and generally 
stir up trouble, usually in pursuit of gold and glory. Elves 
have been known to do all those things, but more typical 
elf adventurers are simple travelers. 
Elves know that once they experience Transcendence, 
the memories they have accumulated will contribute 
to their eternal contentment. So they seek out experi-
ences that will produce exciting, beautiful, or satisfying 
memories. A few battles against monsters certainly 
could qualify, but such activities aren't usually the focus 
of an elf's endeavors. Much preferred are memories of 
faraway places, excellent meals, and fascinating people. 
As such, most elf "adventurers" are primarily sightseers, 
not valiant crusaders or heroes for hire. 
This aspect of elven life isn't as well known among 
other races as it might be, because elves spend much of 
their "adventuring" years in places far away from other 
societies. They're more interested in remote forests, 
lonely valleys, high mountains, and other natural places 
than in cities. Traveling elves want to meet people, but 
not too many. 
A small fraction of elves are born with or develop the 
qualities that mark them as potential adventurers, as 
other races define the term. Many traditional adventur-
ing groups are happy to count an elf among their mem-
bers, and some elves take to this life enthusiastically. 
Elves have a reputation for remaining unruffled in the 
face of danger, a very good quality to have among folk 
who regularly find themselves in difficult situations. 
On extremely rare occasions, an elf might join an 
adventuring party for reasons that are based in fear. 
A tiny percentage of elves develop an irrational fear of 
the serene, contemplative life that awaits them in their
