GITHZERAI ENLIGHTENED 
Githzerai never stop training. They spend long hours in 
meditation to transcend the limits of their forms and to 
apprehend the nature of reality. Zerths who complete 
the next tier of their training become one of the githze-
rai known as the enlightened. 
At will: mage hand (the hand is invisible) 
3/day each: blur, expeditious retreat.feather fall, jump, see invisi-
bility, shield 
1/day each: haste, plane shift, teleport 
Psychic Defense. While the githzerai is wearing no armor and 
wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier. 
ACTI ONS 
Multiattack. The githzerai makes three unarmed strikes. 
Unarmed Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., 
one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) 
psychic damage. 
Temporal Strike (Recharge 6). Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 
reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning dam-
age plus 52 (8d12) psychic damage. The target must succeed 
on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or move l round forward in 
time. A target moved forward in time vanishes for the duration.

or in an unoccupied space nearest to that space if it's occupied.

GRAY RENDER 
A curious impulse drives the gray render. Despite its 
hulking form and terrible appetite, it wants most of all to 
bond with an intelligent creature and, once bonded, give 
its life to protect that creature. Great strength and a sav-
age nature enable gray renders to be fierce guardians, 
but they lack even a shred of cunning. 
A Spreading Plague. Gray renders reproduce by 
forming nodules on their bodies that, upon reaching 
maturity, break off to begin life as young gray renders. 
These monstrosities feel no obligation to their young, 
and they have no inclination to gather with others of 
their kind. 
Chaotic Allies. As a side effect of its breeding, each 
gray render has an overpowering need to bond with 
an intelligent creature. When it encounters a suitable 
master, the render sings to it- a weird, warbling cry 
accompanied by scratching at the earth and a show of 
deference. Once it forms the bond, the render serves its 
master in all things. 
Although this bond can be a great benefit, renders are 
inherently chaotic. In a battle, a render fights with all 
the savagery it can muster and never willingly harms 
its master, but outside battle, a gray render might pres-
ent considerable difficulty for its master's associates. It 
might follow its master even after being told to stay put, 
destroy its master's house, burrow holes in the side of a 
ship, kill horses, attack when it feels jealous, and more. 
A gray render might be a boon companion, but it is al-
ways an unpredictable one. 
The Gray Render Quirks table presents possible 
quirks for gray renders that can be generated randomly 
or selected as desired.
