Giants don't launch direct attacks on dwarven strong-
holds except under extraordinary circumstances. Their 
size is a great disadvantage in the underground pas-
sages of a fortress, potentially turning any such assault 
into a suicide mission. 
0RCS 
Every ore tribe dreams of overrunning a dwarven 
stronghold and returning to the caves with a war wagon 
laden with gold, gems, stout armor, and sharp weap-
ons. Given the ores' propensity to rely on brute force 
rather than cunning, they can overcome only severely 
weakened dwarven strongholds. Unfortunately for the 
dwarves, ores seem to receive omens from Gruumsh 
bidding them to invade a stronghold just when it is 
wracked with plague, riven by infighting, or otherwise at 
its weakest. The all-seeing eye of Gruumsh is ever vigi-
lant for signs that Moradin's children have faltered. 
DUERGAR 
The evil dwarves of the Underdark are responsible for 
the constant undercurrent of peril in the life of any clan. 
Although the duergar don't come near the surface in 
sufficient numbers to invade and occupy a stronghold, 
they send out raiding parties to set upon any dwarves 
they find on the loose and to pull off occasional acts of 
sabotage or guerrilla activity. Though no dwarven for-
tresses are currently at risk of succumbing to a duergar 
onslaught, none of them are immune to the treachery 
that a small group of gray dwarves can commit. 
WHEN CLANS COLLAPSE 
WE HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE-REVENGE AGAINST TI-IOSE 
who drove us out of our home. 
- Queen Helgret Deephammer, 
of the Deephammer clan in exile 
For all the attention dwarves pay to their defenses and 
the security of their homes, no clan is immortal and no 
stronghold unassailable. Threats to a clan can come 
from the outside or the inside, and it's often the latter 
variety that proves more difficult to defeat. 
Every clan is aware that there are plenty of unprinci-
pled creatures in the world that would love to steal its 
cherished works or even obliterate the dwarves and take 
over their home. Formidable though they may be, these 
are enemies that can be prepared for. More insidious 
are the forces that can tear apart a clan from within. 
FESTERING RIVALRIES 
It's not unusual for individuals in a clan to fall prey to oc-
casional bickering and infighting. Abbathor's influence 
affects some dwarves more than others, and even those 
with the strongest resolve can be tempted to compro-
mise their principles from time to time. 
Minor turmoil of this sort rarely leads to civil war or 
a rapid decline of the clan's strength. But in the worst 
cases, a clan's collective lack of dedication to its goals 
strains the bonds between elements that must work 
together for the clan to prosper. Feuds between artisans 
drive wedges between families. Dwarf traders strike 
C H APTER 3 I DWARVES AND DUERCAR 
FRIENDLY FROM A DISTANCE 
Even though dwarves have a natural affinity for one an-
other, different clans keep a comfortable distance between 
their strongholds. Anyone not of the clan, even another 
dwarf, is considered an outsider. 
Relations between neighboring clans are cordial, if not 
warm. They might exchange messengers to share lore 
and news that can prove useful against the vagaries of the 
outside world, but that is likely to be the extent of their 
contact. Under normal circumstances, dwarves prefer to 
be left alone. Interacting with neighbors brings unpredict-
ability and change, things dwarves prefer to avoid. 
Circumstances cease to be normal when a clan faces an 
external threat. When word gets out that one of their own 
is in danger, dwarves of other clans rally against the threat 
without question. The standoffish diplomacy that marks 
their normal relations gives way to an unshakable alliance. 
An attack on one dwarf clan is an attack against them all. 
deals that fail to benefit the clan, and stone carvers start 
using short cuts that compromise their constructions. 
If such a decline continues for too long and becomes 
too severe, the result could be a schism within the clan. 
The quarreling factions might segregate themselves in 
different parts of the stronghold; in an extreme case, 
some clan members might leave to found a new commu-
nity. In either event, a divided clan is weaker than it was 
before the unrest occurred, and thus it's an easier target 
for outside enemies. If selfishness and greed were not 
enough to bring the clan to utter destruction, the horde 
of ores waiting to attack will be happy to finish the job. 
A LIFE IN EXILE 
If the worst comes to pass and the loss of a clan's 
stronghold to invaders is inevitable, most of the dwarves 
would be willing to die while making a last stand for 
their home. But the clan must survive, even if only as a 
shell of its former self, and so every clan has a contin-
gency plan to secure a safe escape for the stronghold's 
children and enough adults to care for them. 
If the survivors are able to get away, they tend to 
seek shelter in a human city or kingdom. Their skill as 
artisans ensures that almost any community would wel-
come their contribution to the workforce, and they can 
eke out a comfortable existence for themselves. 
A group of refugee dwarves seeking residence in a 
community will do whatever they can to live together, 
keeping the clan intact. They recreate what they can of 
their former lifestyle, living underground when possible 
and remaining isolated from their neighbors. 
DWARF ADVENTURERS 
~~~~~~~~~~-
THE MOUNTAJNS WERE HOME ONCE, BUT NEVER AGAJN. 
-Tenelar, Outcast of Five Peaks 
A dwarf who leaves the stronghold to pursue a life of ad-
venturing does so for one of two reasons. Some dwarves 
set out with the blessing of the clan to undertake an im-
portant mission. Others depart, willingly or otherwise, 
because they simply don't fit in. 
When a situation calls for such drastic action, the no-
bles or priests select one or more clan members to ven-
ture forth. These dwarves are charged with a specific 
quest, such as recovering a stolen artifact or discovering
