CYRROLLALEE 
Cyrrollalee embodies the spirit of friendship and hospi-
tality that is part of every halfting's makeup and is rep-
resented by one's home and hearth. The home is a wel-
coming place, but it is also sacrosanct. Halflings honor 
Cyrrollalee by opening their homes to visitors, and by 
respecting the home of one's host as if it were one's own. 
Every ha I fling village tells its version of the legendary 
tale of Cyrrollalee and the troll pies. Long ago, a large 
human town near Cyrrollalee's village was regularly at-
tacked by a vicious troll. Warriors from the town hacked 
at the troll, but even its most dire wounds would heal, 
and the troll would come back again. One day Cyrrol-
lalee presented herself at the town gate in apron and 
peasant clothes, and she offered to rid the town of the 
troll. The proud human warriors all scoffed at her, but 
the desperate mayor asked Cyrrollalee for her help. 
So Cyrrollalee set all the people in the town to baking 
pies, but not just any pies. They were special troll pies. 
Into each one she put a pinch of magic to make them 
irresistible to trolls. While the warriors of the town 
grumbled and sharpened their steel, Cyrrollalee created 
an atmosphere of fun, bringing cheer to the frightened 
people as they worked. When the day was done, she set 
off with a cart full of pies and laid them in a tasty trail 
far up into the mountains. When the troll came near the 
town and found the trail, it began to gobble up pie after 
pie, following the delightful smells up the mountain path 
until it walked right into the lair of a young red dragon. 
The greedy troll was swiftly incinerated. 
Cyrrollalee returned a hero, and from that day for-
ward all the townsfolk remembered her with a word of 
thanks when baking pies. 
BRANDOBARIS 
Dashing trickster, patron of thieves, and star of fantas-
tical fables and wild stories of adventure- that's the 
legacy of Brandobaris, the Master of Stealth. Stories of 
Brandobaris, full of artful trickery and narrow escapes, 
inspire many young halflings to play at roguish pursuits. 
In their imagination, a grain silo becomes a lofty wiz-
ard's tower to scale in search of treasures, or a rowboat 
becomes the setting for a swashbuckling adventure. And 
for some-the youngsters who are said to "have a bit of 
Brandobaris in them"- that play-acting is the prelude to 
a life of living as Brandobaris does: always on the look-
out for the next challenge. 
Brandobaris continues to wander in search of excite-
ment, and now, as an ascended being, his travels span 
the planes of existence. His curiosity takes him to all 
corners of the multiverse in search of magical curios, 
rare treasures, and mystical puzzles. When Brandobaris 
moves stealthily, no mortal or god can hear his foot-
falls- an ability he uses not only for defense, but also to 
bestow unlooked-for treats upon those he favors. 
Although he never seems to rest in his travels, Bran-
dobaris always has time to reward halflings who dare 
to take risks and explore the world to make their own 
mark on it. He has been known to give a bit of aid to 
halflings in dire straits, turning them invisible for a time 
or intervening so that they can't be heard or tracked. 
C llAl'TER 5 I HAU-LI NGS AND GNOMES 
UROGALAN 
In ancient times the halfting hero Urogalan left his 
village with his faithful hound to venture into the af-
terlife-and then, much to the villagers' amazement, 
he returned. They could see that Urogalan had been 
deeply affected by his experiences, since he didn't speak 
for a long time. He merely sat in a white robe with his 
hound by his side, watching the world go by. When he 
did speak at last, he told of a place he called the Green 
Fields, where the halftings' god-heroes live alongside 
mortals who have passed on, enjoying lush farmland, 
bright sunshine, and all the comforts of home. 
Urogalan declared that all who have gone before still 
watch over their loved ones from this place of eternal 
peace, sending messages to the material world. In ac-
knowledgment of this assertion, halflings look for signs 
from their departed loved ones. One might be thinking 
about catching butterflies with his grandmother long 
ago, when suddenly a butterfly lands on his hand- clear 
evidence that, as Urogalan promised, she is still looking 
out for her grandson from beyond the veil of death. 
As a divine being, Urogalan can move freely through 
the earth and across the planes of existence. He holds 
aloft a magic lantern that protects him on his journeys. 
With his black hound leading the way, Urogalan scours 
the multiverse and shepherds deceased halfiings to their 
eternal home in the Green Fields. 
Unlike other halfting deities, Urogalan is surrounded 
by a cloud of melancholy. He is gaunt, with his dusky 
skin covered by white robes. Priests who venerate Uro-
galan emulate this practice of dress and demeanor. 
THE HALFLING ADVENTURER 
WHO KNOWS WHERE A HERO'S SPIRIT WlLL GROW? EvEN 
the smallest seed can produce the mightiest tree. 
-Elminster Aumar, Sage of Shadowdale 
Everything about halflings, from their small stature to 
their easy demeanor, makes them unlikely candidates 
for taking up a life of adventure away from home. Yet 
every generation produces a handful of exceptional in-
dividuals who defy conventional wisdom and seek their 
fortunes in the wider world. 
Opinions vary on what compels some halftings to 
leave home and set off over the farthest hill to explore 
the unknown. The simplest explanation is that some 
folk are born with an overabundance of curiosity. Some 
say that Arvoreen or Brandobaris is responsible for urg-
ing them on, and others point to the stories told by the 
elders that inspire some youngsters to take such risks. 
Whatever the reason, from time to time a halfling feels 
the call of adventure and sets off with a walking staff, 
a satchel, and a few biscuits. The first stop for many of 
these plucky souls is a faraway city where they hope to 
find some like-minded companions. 
FANCY FEET 
A halfling's potential for adventuring usually manifests 
early in life. When a child first wanders away from the 
village, seemingly by accident, or one day hops on a 
log and tries to set off down the river, the parents are
