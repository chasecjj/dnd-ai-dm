R UTTERKIN 
The rutterkins, a breed of warped demon, roam the 
Abyss in mobs that constantly search for intruders to 
surround and devour. 
A byssal D efen der s. Rutterkins protect the Abyss 
from non-demons. When they spot any interlopers, they 
gather in a crowd and surge forward, emitting a wave of 
fear in advance of their attacks that leaves their victims 
terrified and rooted in place. 
Warping Plague. Creatures bitten by rutterkins are 
exposed to a terrible disease that infects them with the 
corrupting influence of the Abyss. Victims that succumb 
to the disease experience tremendous pain as 
their bodies become disfigured, flesh twisting 
around the bones, until they transform to join the 
mass of abyssal wretches that follow in the wake 
of the rutterkin mob that laid them low.

Crippling Fear. When a creature that isn't a demon starts its 
turn within 30 feet of three or more rutterkins, it must make 
a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. The creature has disadvantage 
on the save if it's within 30 feet of six or more rutterkins. On a 
successful save, the creature is immune to the Crippling Fear 
of all rutterkins for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature 
beCOrlJ.eS frightened of the rutterkins for l minute. While 
frightened in this way, the creature is restrained. At the end of 
each of the frightened creature's turns, it can repeat the saving 
throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, 
it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against 
disease or become poisoned. At the end of each long rest, the 
poisoned target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect 
on itself on a success. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points 
while poisoned in this way, it dies and instantly transforms into 
a living abyssal wretch. The transformation of the body can be 
undone only by a wish spell.
