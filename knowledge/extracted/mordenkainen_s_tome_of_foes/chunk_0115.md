• 
curling talons, and long, serrated tails that can fiense 
the flesh from a victim, and they use them all to carve 
through their foes. When they are up against tough 
formations, they can call on their innate magic to loose 
bolts of lightning and blow holes in the enemy ranks. 
BULEZAU 
Diseased manifestations of animalistic rage, bulezaus 
embody the violence of nature. Across the Abyss, 
bulezaus lurk in deep canyons and lofty crags, and many 
find a place in the ranks of the demon lords' armies, 
serving as foot soldiers in the Abyss's endless warring. 
Bloodlust. Bulezaus crave violence. Their eagerness 
to kill and willingness to die make them common mem-
bers of any demon lord's entourage. When not being 
corralled by larger and tougher demons, bulezaus gather 
into scrabbling mobs, wrestling and fighting among 
themselves until a better target comes along or until a 
stronger demon bullies them into subservience. 
Repulsive. Disfiguring ailments plague bulezaus: 
crusted eyes, maggots wriggling in open sores, and a 
reek of rotten meat that follows them wherever they go.

C ll APTER. GI BESTIARY 
DYBBUK 
Dybbuks terrorize mortals on the Material Plane by . 
possessing corpses and giving them a semblance of hfe, 
after which the demons use them to engage in a range of 
sordid activities. 
Puppet Masters. In their natural form, dybbuks ap-
pear as translucent flying jellyfish, trailing long tendrils 
as they move through the air. They rarely travel in this 
fashion, however. Instead, a dybbuk possesses the first 
suitable corpse it finds, rousing the body from death so 
it can then indulge its hideous vices. 
Dark Masquerade. By plundering a corpse's mem-
ories and accessing its capabilities, a dybbuk can im-
personate the creature as it was in life. But the truth of 
the matter quickly becomes apparent to those around 
it, because a dybbuk can't resist pursuing its vices with 
a maniacal single-mindedness that betrays its true na-
ture. Dybbuks delight in terrorizing other creatures by 
making their host bodies behave in horrifying ways-
throwing up gouts of blood, excreting piles of squirming 
maggots, and contorting their limbs in impossible ways 
as they scuttle across the ground. 
quadruped to move as a biped. Any beast or humanoid that 
sees this behavior must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving 
throw or become frightened of the dybbuk for 1 minute. The 
frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A 
creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this ability is 
immune to Violate Corpse for 24 hours. 
ACTION 
Tendril. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, its 
hit point maximum is also reduced by 3 (ld6). This reduction 
lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target 
dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. 
Possess Corpse (Recharge 6). The dybbuk disappears into an 
intact corpse it can see within 5 feet of it. The corpse must 
be Large or smaller and be that of a beast or a humanoid. 
The dybbuk is now effectively the possessed creature. Its type 
becomes undead, though it now looks alive, and it gains a 
number of temporary hit points equal to the corpse's hit point 
maximum in life. 
While possessing the corpse, the dybbuk retains its hit 
points, alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, telepathy, 
and immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and being 
charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed 
target's game statistics, gaining access to its knowledge and 
proficiencies but not its class features, if any. 
The possession lasts until the temporary hit points are lost 
(at which point the body becomes a corpse once more) or the 
dybbuk ends its possession using a bonus action. When the 
possession ends, the dybbuk reappears in an unoccupied space 
within 5 feet of the corpse.
