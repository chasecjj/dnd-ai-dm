In most cases, Orcus transforms his followers into un-
dead creatures such as ghouls and wights. Sometimes

ers gain the Aura of Death trait.

extends 30 feet in every direction from its space while it isn't

boons, using the boons' recipients as pawns. A de-
mon can grant a special trait based on its type, as

D EMONIC CAMBIONS 
Cambions spawned by demon lords sometimes mani-
fest different abilities from a typical cambion. Graz'zt is 
notable among demon lords for the many cambions he 
has spawned across the multiverse. Most famous among 
them is Iuz, who combined his father's abyssal heritage 
and his mother's peerless arcane tutelage to become 
a demigod. 
CHAPTER l I THE BLOOD WAR. 
DEMONIC C/IM810NS 
SIGNATURE S PELLS 
~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Cambions have the Innate Spellcasting trait. When 
customizing a demonic cambion, you can replace spells 
in that trait with ones of the same level from the list of 
signature spells in the boon entry of the demonic parent. 
The cambion can use these spells once per day each. 
SPECIAL TRAITS 
A cambion descended from a demon can have the 
special traits conferred to that demon's cultists, as de-
scribed in the demon's boon section. 
Few demons consort with mortals, and those with the 
charm or desire to usually grant their cambion children 
the Fiendish Charm ability. Cultists of Baphomet and 
Orcus can also use foul rituals to infuse their master's 
strength into a young or unborn child, yielding a cult 
champion who can wield special abilities; a cambion 
linked to Orcus replaces Fiendish Charm with Spawn of 
the Grave, and one linked to Baphomet replaces it with 
Horned One's Call. 
Horned One's Call. When the cambion targets only one crea· 
tu re with the attacks of its Multiattack, it can choose one ally 
it can see within 30 feet. That ally can use its reaction to make 
one melee attack against a target of its choice. 
Spawn of the Grave. At the end of each of the cambion's turns, 
each undead of its choice that it can see within 30 feet gains 10 
temporary hit points, provided the cambion isn't incapacitated. 
In addition, this cambion can use its Innate Spellcasting abil-
ity to cast animate dead three times per day.
