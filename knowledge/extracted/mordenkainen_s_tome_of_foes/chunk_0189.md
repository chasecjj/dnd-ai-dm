STAR SPAWN SEER 
A star spawn seer is most often encountered as the 
leader of a cult that worships one or more of the Elder 
Evils. Usually, the seer is the only cult member that 
grasps the full extent of the horror the cult is venerating. 
An entity that appears as a star spawn seer in the 
Material Plane usually arrives as something different-
something disembodied. When a warlock or other spell-
caster establishes communication with it, the seer-entity 
takes control of the mortal's form and spirit, transform-
ing it into a star spawn seer. Whoever the seer once was 
largely vanishes beneath the corpulent bulk of tumorous 
skin than builds up in strange whorls all over the seer's 
body. Hands become bulky, flipper-like appendages ca-
pable of grasping their strange staffs-formed of some 
blend of flesh, bone, and star stuff- but clumsy and pain-
ful when used to manipulate other things. 
A star spawn seer is almost always accompanied 
by one or more star spawn hulks. Although the hulk 
is a worthy combatant in its own right, it's also a vital 
part of a tactic often used by seers. When a seer deals 
psychic damage to a hulk, the hulk isn't hurt, while the 
effect ricochets off the hulk and expands to assault other 
creatures. 
The seer's goal is to tap the energy sources and 
master the rites that will enable it to extend a bridge 
between the vulnerable sanity of the Material Plane and 
the squirming madness of an Elder Evil's prison. 
ELDER EVIL BLESSINGS 
Through generations of study and grim practice, the 
disciples of certain Elder Evils have mastered the ability 
to bestow supernatural gifts on minions they select for 
the privilege. Any creature that serves a cult of Elder 
Evil, including a star spawn, can be given one of these 
rewards- usually as compensation for faithful service, 
but sometimes as a chance for a creature that breached 
the cult's laws to redeem itself. The following powers 
are unique to specific cults, and typically a creature has 
no more than one of them. 
CULT O F BOREM OF THE L AKE OF BOILING 
M UD 
Borem's Embrace (1/Day). The cultist touches one creature 
within S feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexter-
ity saving throw or be coated in sticky, steaming mud. While it 
is coated in this way, the target's speed is halved, it can't use 
reactions, and it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each 
of its turns. The effect lasts for 1 minute, until the cultist is in-
capacitated or dies, or until the target is immersed in water. 
C ULT OF A TROPUS THE WORLD BORN DEAD 
Gaze of Corruption (Recharge 6). The cultist targets one crea-
ture it can see within 30 feet ofit. The target must succeed on 
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d10) necrotic 
damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, end-
ing the effect on itself on a success. 
C ULT OF H AASK THE VOICE OF H ARGUT 
Haask's Presence (1/Day). The cultist transforms into a Tiny, 
leech-like being and teleports onto the shoulder of a humanoid 
that it can see within 30 feet of it. The targeted humanoid must 
succeed on a DC 1 S Charisma saving throw or be charmed by 
the cultist. While the target is charmed, the cultist has control 
of it on the target's next turn. At the end of that turn, the cultist 
teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of 
it and returns to its normal form. The cultist can't be targeted 
directly by any attack or other effect while it's in the slug-like 
form, but it is subject to areas of effect as normal. 
CULT OF ITRANTH RAXUS THE FLAMED ONE 
Radiant Flames (1/Day). Multihued flame surrounds the cultist 
for 1 minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or until 
the cultist extinguishes the flame {no action required). While 
inflamed, the cultist has telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and 
it can teleport as a bonus action up to 30 feet to an unoccupied 
space it can see. In addition, every creature that starts its turn 
within 5 feet of the cultist must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 16 (3dl0) radiant damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. 
CULT OF T HARI ZDUN T HE C HAINED GOD 
Tharizdun's Spark (Recharge 6). As a bonus action, the cultist 
touches a simple or martial weapon or a natural weapon, if it 
has one. The next creature hit by the touched weapon must 
succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or experience short-
term madness for 10 minutes. Consult the Short-Term Mad-
ness table (see "Madness Effects" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon 
Master's Guide) to determine the form of the madness. The 
affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each 
minute, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
ELDER EVILS 
Exactly who or what the Elder Evils are remains in dispute 
among the rare sources of knowledge about them. Few 
creatures in the multiverse have any awareness of these 
beings, and no one can claim to know them all. 
Some Elder Evils are called gods, primordials, or fiends. 
Yet some scholars versed in esoteric mysteries insist they 
are none of these, but in fact are beings set apart from 
what mortals consider reality. Some Elder Evils are alleged 
to be creatures of the Far Realm, while others are thought 
to be trapped in a particular plane or world, or held in 
check somehow by wandering stars, imprisoned in the 
vastness of the night sky. 
The names given to these terrible entities include such 
strange descriptions as ltyak-Ortheel the Elf-Eater, Dendar 
the Night Serpent, Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud, 
Kezef the Chaos Hound, Zargon the Returner, Carn nod 
the Unseen, Holashner the Hunger Below, Piscaethces the 
Blood Queen, Shothotugg the Eater of Worlds, Y'chak the 
Violet Flame, Bolothamogg Who Watches from Beyond 
the Stars, Hargut of the Gray Pestilence, Haask the Voice 
of Hargut, Ragnorra the Mother of Monsters, the Hulks of 
Zoretha, Kyuss the Worm That Walks, Tharizdun the Elder 
Elemental Eye, Atropus the World Born Dead, Pandorym 
the Utter Annihilation, Haemnathuun the Blood lord, 
Maram of the Great Spear, Tyranthraxus the Flamed One, 
the unnamed Queen of Chaos, and Father Llymic, the 
Alien Thought Given Flesh. 
The extent to which these beings have power beyond 
their native environments varies, as do notions of their 
relative strength. But they are all forces of corruption and 
evil. Nothing good can come from their influence. No 
bargain made with them ends in anything other than mad-
ness, plague, death, or worse.
