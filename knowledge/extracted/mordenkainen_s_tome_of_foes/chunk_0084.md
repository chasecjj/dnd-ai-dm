As their means of vengeance against the mind flayers, 
the githzerai send bands of warriors called rrakkmas-
illithid hunting parties- to other planes to do battle 
with any mind flayers they come across. It is in these 
circumstances that the natives of the plane most often 
encounter githzerai away from their monastery. With 
their attention focused only on their mission, the githze-
rai pay little heed to those around as long as they don't 
interfere with the hunt.
