Rotting Presence. When any creature that isn't a demon starts 
its turn within 30 feet one or more bulezaus, that creature must 
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 ne-
crotic damage plus 1 necrotic damage for each bulezau within 
30 feet of it. 
Standing Leap. The bulezau's long jump is up to 20 feet and its 
high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start. 
Sure-Footed. The bulezau has advantage on Strength and 
Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would 
knock it prone. 
ACTIONS 
Barbed Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach S ft., one 
target. Hit: 8 (1dl2 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a 
creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw 
against disease or become poisoned until the disease ends. 
While poisoned in this way, the target sports festering boils, 
coughs up flies, and sheds rotting skin, and the target must 
repeat the saving throw after every 24 hours that elapse. On a 
successful save, the disease ends. On a failed save, the target's 
hit point maximum is reduced by 4 (ld8). The target dies if its 
hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
