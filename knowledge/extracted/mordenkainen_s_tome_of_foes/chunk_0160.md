Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following 
spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: charm person, Tasha's hideous laughter

within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed by the 
eladrin for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature be-
comes immune to any eladrin's Joyful Presence for 24 hours. 
Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the charmed creature, 
it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on 
a success.

against spells and other magical effects.
