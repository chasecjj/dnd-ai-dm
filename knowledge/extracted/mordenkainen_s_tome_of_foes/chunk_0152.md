DROW MATRON MOTHER 
At the head of each drow noble house sits a matron 
mother, an influential priestess of Lolth charged with 
carrying out the god's will while also advancing the 
interests of the family. Matron mothers embody the 
scheming and treachery associated with the Queen of 
Spiders. Each stands at the center of a vast conspir-
atorial web, with demons, drow, spiders, and slaves 
positioned between them and their enemies. Although 
matron mothers command great power, that power 
depends on maintaining the Spider Queen's favor, and 
the dark god sometimes capriciously takes back what 
she has given. The stat block here represents a matron 
mother at the height of her power. 
DROW SHADOWBLADE 
Drow shadowblades steal down the darkened passages 
of the Underdark, bound on errands of mayhem. Ruth-
less killers, shadowblades find employment with a noble 
house, usually involving the elimination of a rival in 
another house. Shadowblades also protect enclaves and 
Underdark cities from enemies and track down thieves 
who make off with prized treasures. In whatever role 
they serve, they move undetected until the moment they 
attack. And then they are the last thing their victims see. 
A shadowblade harnesses a dark magic that is said 
to arise from a fiendish ritual in which the drow kills a 
lesser demon and mystically prevents it from reforming 
in the Abyss. This ritual creates a shadow demon and 
infuses the drow with shadow magic.

Some drow shadowblades have an action that allows them 
to summon a demon. 
Summon Shadow Demon (1 / Day). The drow attempts 
to magically summon a shadow demon with a 50 percent 
chance of success. If the attempt fails, the drow takes 5 
(ldlO) psychic damage. Otherwise, the summoned demon 
appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its sum-
moner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon 
other demons. It remains for l 0 minutes, until it or its 
summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as

of the turn. 
Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the drow has 
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks that rely on sight. 
ACTIONS 
.. 
Multiattack. The drow makes two attacks with its shadow 
sword. If either attack hits and the target is within 10 feet of a 
5-foot cube of darkness created by the shadow sword on a pre-
vious turn, the drow can dismiss that darkness and cause the 
target to take 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The drow can dismiss 
darkness in this way no more than once per turn. 
Shadow Sword. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 8 (ld6 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic 
damage and 10 (3d6) poison damage. The drow can then fill an 
unoccupied 5-foot cube within 5 feet of the target with magical 
darkness, which remains for 1 minute. 
Hand Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +9to hit, range 30/120 
ft., one target. Hit: 8 (ld6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target 
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poi-
soned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the tar-
get is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target 
regaios consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature 
takes an action to shake it.
