CHAPTER 1: 
THE BLOOD WAR 
HROUGHOUT HISTORY, THE TEEMING HORDES 
of the Abyss and the strictly regimented 
legions of the Nine Hells have battled for su-
premacy in the cosmos. In the mortal world, 
the scant few scholars, arcanists, and ad-
venturers who know the conflict for what it 
is refer to it as the Blood War. 
The fighting takes place across the Lower Planes, on 
the Material Plane, and anywhere else that demons and 
devils might congregate. From time to time, demons 
spill out of the Abyss to invade Avernus, the uppermost 
layer of the Nine Hells. While the devils defend their 
home turf, they also make strikes against locations in 
the Abyss. Although the intensity of the conflict waxes 
and wanes, and the front lines of the war can shift dras-
tically, a moment never goes by when demons and devils 
aren't battling each other somewhere in the multiverse. 
THE GREAT DANCE 
WE MEASURE OURSELVES BY THOSE WE FICHT, AND MY 
company faces the greatest threat to the cosmos. 
-Veritus Wrath, commander, Flawless Execution 
The battle lines in the Blood War undulate like a writh-
ing snake. Each time one side gains an advantage, in-
variably its lines weaken somewhere else. 
Demons enter the Nine Hells by following the River 
Styx from the Abyss into Avernus. By hiring skilled mer-
renoloth pilots to navigate the river, a demon lord can 
transport an invasion force of enormous size. 
Mimicking a complex dance, the two sides shift their 
attacks and trade positions with each passing day. About 
once every thousand years, the demons close in on the 
lower reaches of the Styx and portals leading deeper 
into the Hells. Invariably, the legions of the Nine Hells 
boil up from below to repel the invaders out of Avernus, 
back to the juncture where the Styx enters the Hells. 
This drive by the devils attracts the attention of more 
demons from the Abyss, which pushes the front line 
back into Avernus. The process repeats itself time and 
time again. 
To the good fortune of the rest of the multiverse, al-
most all the battles in the Blood War take place in the 
Abyss and the Nine Hells. Whether by cosmic chance 
or the design of some unknown power, the dark waters 
of the Styx provide passage between the two planes, · 
but pathways to other realms are at best fleeting and 
unreliable. Despite the difficulty of escaping the Lower 
Planes, combatants on both sides find their way to the 
Material Plane and other realms from time to time. 
Although the conflicts on these other planes are little 
more than skirmishes in the Blood War, even a small 
number of demons and devils can wreak havoc and 
bring destruction wherever they see fit to do battle.

MORTALS AND MINIONS ____ 
_ 
Devils and demons are far from the only combatants in 
the Blood War. Both sides exploit the Material Plane's 
most abundant resource- mortal creatures, whose bod-
ies and souls are both useful to the cause. 
Devils constantly strive to recruit mortals into their 
ranks by offering them rewards in return for their ser-
vice. While they live, these cultists carry out the wishes 
of their archdevil masters, whether raiding an enemy 
outpost or gathering more members for the cult. When 
a cultist dies, its soul emerges in the Nine Hells and 
becomes another of the Blood War's immortal soldiers. 
Most of the evil souls consigned to an afterlife in the 
Nine Hells become lemures, which make up the vast ma-
jority of the hellish forces, but some mortal recruits who 
willingly accept a contract offer from a powerful devil 
can arrive as a lesser devil. 
Demons generally have no regard for mortal souls and 
do not solicit them, but living creatures do have their 
uses. Groups of corrupted cultists dedicated to one of 
the demon lords exist all across the realms of the mate-
rial world. For as long as these mortals do the bidding 
of their lord, they are allowed to live. From a demon's 
perspective, all other living creatures are nothing more 
than sheep ripe for slaughter, and demonic cultists 
share this view. These fanatics don't hesitate to slay 
other mortals if given the chance- and if their victims 
happen to be in league with devils, so much the better. 
A casual observer might suppose that two forces of 
evil bent on exterminating each other would be an ad-
vantageous situation for the forces of good, but the com-
batants in the Blood War have no regard for collateral 
damage- and on the Material Plane, they can cause a lot 
of it. If agents of Asmodeus discover a thriving demon 
cult in a city, they might deal with the threat by starting 
a fire that not only destroys the cult but burns through 
several neighborhoods and kills hundreds of innocents. 
A demon might unleash a plague to kill every person in 
a town, just for the sake of claiming from its library an 
old book containing a map to a lost artifact. The fiends 
on both sides of the Blood War take the path of least 
resistance to their goals, heedless of consequences that 
don't affect them. 
AGENTS OF TREACHERY 
Both sides in the Blood War employ spies and soldiers 
drawn from the ranks of other evil creatures of the 
planes. The devils are generally more successful at this 
tactic because of the discipline they can bring to bear 
on these ostensible allies. Even so, powerful, intelligent 
CHAPTE R I I THE llLOOD WAR 
demon lords such as Graz'zt can also force their agents 
to do their bidding under threat of annihilation. 
As creatures that don't favor either cause, because 
they care nothing for the philosophical concerns of law 
and chaos, other fiends including incubi, succubi, and 
night hags work for whichever side offers the best com-
pensation. Demons use them as insurrectionists in the 
Nine Hells, inciting rebellion and defiance. The devils 
employ such creatures as scouts, who use their magic 
and other abilities to navigate the Abyss and gain intelli-
gence about the demons' activities. Adventurers hired by 
an agent of the Nine Hells to make a foray into the Abyss 
are customarily guided by such a mercenary. 
THE SEA RCH FOR SECRETS 
The Blood War has all the characteristics of an eternal 
stalemate, in part because the two sides are so familiar 
with each other. Every time the Abyss belches forth 
some new variety of horror, the disciplined and well-
trained legions of the Nine Hells reorganize, rally, and 
counterattack. The devils continually dream up varia-
tions on their attack strategies, only to be checked by 
the overwhelming chaotic force of the Abyss. Little true 
advancement occurs under the angry red sky of Avernus 
or in any other realm where the forces clash. 
The leaders of each side recognize that the introduc-
tion of some unexpected factor could permanently affect 
the balance of power. Accordingly, demons and devils 
constantly send their agents across the planes in search 
of artifacts, powerful creatures to recruit, and other 
resources that could lead to a key advantage in the war. 
Adventurers of great repute might get involved in such 
a quest, either as unwitting pawns or as an independent 
force pursuing its own ends. 
COSMIC BATTLEFIELD 
The Blood War rages along the length of the River Styx. 
Direct confrontations between demons and devils erupt 
along its banks, making any of the Lower Planes the 
Styx touches a potential battleground. 
The devils view fighting demons on Avernus as a net 
benefit for their cause. Although most devils slain there 
are destroyed forever, ready access to supplies and sup-
port from the Nine Hells tilts the tide heavily against in-
SAILING T HE STYX 
The River Styx frustrates every attempt to map it or predict 
its course. Although anyone can try to navigate it, only 
merrenoloths, the yugoloth ferrymen of the Styx, can fault-
lessly negotiate the Styx's treacherous waters. For a price, 
merrenoloths will carry anyone safely and swiftly across 
planar boundaries. The greater the distance and the more 
perilous the passengers to be ferried, the higher the price. 
Getting lost while sailing the Styx isn't the only danger 
the river presents. Merely tasting or touching its waters 
causes most creatures to become stupefied, and drinking 
fully or being immersed for too long can render that con· 
dition permanent, robbing a creature of all its memories. 
Fiends don't fear being momentarily exposed to the Styx, 
but-with the notable exception ofhydroloths, merreno· 
loths, and amnizus--even they can't retain their memories 
if they drink from the River Styx or swim for too long in 
its waters.
