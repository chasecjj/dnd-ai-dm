SHADAR- K AI 
In the perpetual gloom of the Shadowfell lives a society 
that serves the Raven Queen. They were brought into 
that dusky realm in ages past, so long ago that they're 
now perfectly adapted to that cheerless environment, 
both physically and mentally. 
Soul Custodian s. Shadar-kai watch over both the 
Shadowfell and the material world, scouting out choice 
souls and tragedies that might please their deity. They 
are rumored to be able to coax worldly events along 
tragic paths for her amusement. The Raven Queen is 
famously cryptic even to her most devoted followers, 
however. The shadar-kai's efforts are rewarded only 
with vague omens they interpret as best they can. 
Blighted Elves. Shadar-kai were once elves, but 
eons of exposure to the debilitating influence of the 
Shadowfell has left them joyless and mournful. In that 
realm, they have the appearance of withered elves: pale 
hair, wrinkled gray skin, and swollen joints give them a 
corpselike aspect. They appear more youthful while on 
other planes, but their skin always retains its deathly 
pallor. They dress in dark cloaks and heavy veils, detest 
mirrors, and avoid keeping things that remind them of 
their age. 
Although a formidable fighter, a gloom weaver is often 
content to remain hidden in the shadows, watching with 
rapt attention as its very presence affects its victims. 
Its dark energy weighs down the heart, causing those 
within its oppressive aura to feel the approach of death. 
This torment alone is enough to please its master, 
the Raven Queen, but should it be detected, a gloom 
weaver uses its shadow magic to reduce its enemies to 
ghastly corpses. 
SHA D OW D ANCER 
Those who have fought shadow dancers describe the 
experience as similar to fighting a living darkness. Ev-
ery dim alcove and darkened nook is a place from where 
the lithe and acrobatic shadow dancers can emerge to 
ambush their prey. Using this tactic, they attack their en-
emies from all angles with a flurry of entangling chains 
that hold fast and corrupt the flesh. When their quarry 
is helpless, others move in to help dispatch the prey. 
Then they loot the corpse for trinkets, anything colorful 
and lively to gaze at after they return to the gloom of the 
Shadow fell. 
S OUL MONGER 
Wracked with despair over the loss of memories of a 
brighter time, soul mongers now crave the vitality of 
others. The aching void within a soul monger radiates 
outward, manifesting as an unbearable weight that 
drains the vigor of anyone unfortunate enough to be in 
its presence. Those who have escaped the onslaught of a 
soul monger can hardly shake the memory of the sound 
it makes- the moan of a tortured soul, lost in a bottom-
less well of tragedy.
