detached, thoughtful demeanor, channeling his frustra-
tion at being distracted from pleasurable pursuits into 
the actions of a cool, efficient killer. 
Cultists. Graz'zt attracts most of his followers from 
the ranks of those who seek pleasure above all else. 
He promises dark delights and forbidden ecstasies, in 
return for total submission to him. His cult gathers new 
members by circulating tracts, poems, and other works 
of art that depict encounters with him. Upstanding folk 
regard these works as vulgar, wretched, and obscene, 
but the delights they depict or describe sometimes lure a 
curious soul into learning more about the demon lord. 
When a cult beseeches him during the induction of 
new members, Graz'zt sends an emissary or an avatar 
to preside over the proceedings, which conclude with 
the new followers being treated to a night of debauchery. 
jUIBLEX 
The Faceless Lord is a truly alien creature, said to be re-
sponsible for spawning the oozes found throughout the 
world. Those who study such topics theorize that every 
such creature has a connection to Juiblex, and the de-
mon lord sees and knows all that its minions encounter. 
Wherever Juiblex wanders, it leaves trailings in its 
wake that coalesce into new slimes and oozes. Most 
sages believe that ifJuiblex and its spawn were given 
free rein, they would one day overrun the universe, turn-
ing every realm into an ooze-infested wasteland. 
Cultists. Juiblex has few cultists, and most of them are 
incurably disturbed or delusional. His mortal cultists 
preach of the glorious day to come, when a tide of slimes 
and oozes will swallow the world. These wretched fol-
lowers believe that by aligning with Juiblex, they can 
avoid the fate that awaits all other living creatures. 
The lord's followers dwell underground, where they 
maintain a stable of oozes and slimes that help to pro-
tect their gathering place. They use traps to capture 
sentient creatures, then feed them to the oozes in a sim-
ulation of what awaits all who don't reverejuiblex. 
0RCUS 
The bloated Demon Prince of the Undead seeks to end 
all life in the cosmos, replacing the living with immortal, 
undead creatures that answer only to him. In this grim 
future. the many suns of the Material Plane are extin-
guished, and all hope has faded away. All that remains is 
the eternally static realm of the living dead. 
Orcus is the universe's staunchest advocate of stag-
nation. He sees the activity of life as noisy, crude, and 
maddening. It rakes at his senses like the claws of a rat 
scratch across a hard floor. In his view, the universe can 
know peace only when life's incessant hum is replaced 
with the peace and quiet of the world of the dead. 
Cultists. Worshipers of Orcus are heretics and blas-
phemers who see the gods of the multiverse as cruel, 
unjust creatures. They resent that mortals must suffer 
and die at the whims of these entities. In Orcus, they see 
the promise of release from pain without the demand of 
obedience. In the state of undeath that Orcus offers, they 
will be free from hunger, fear, and worry. 
People who have lost a loved one to a tragic death are 
especially susceptible to his appeal. A father stricken 
with grief after the death of his child might seek Orcus's 
intervention in returning his child to the world after the 
gods cruelly snatched her away. 
All who would become cultists of Orcus must be 
willing to become undead. Those who commit to the 
cause are admitted to the cult. Those who have second 
thoughts and attempt to decline are destroyed, their 
souls condemned to the Outer Planes while their bodies 
are animated as skeletons and zombies. 
YEENOGHU 
Also known as the Beast of Butchery, Yeenoghu inspires 
his followers to devour any creatures they meet. In his 
mind, the cosmos is made up only of predators and prey. 
To sate his blood lust, Yeenoghu often rampages 
across the Abyss, killing everything in his path. Only 
those demons that join him in wreaking carnage can 
avoid his wrath. Yeenoghu's wanderings across the 
Abyss are like the meanderings of a storm. He and his 
cultists pass through an area like a monstrous hurri-
cane whose course can never be predicted. 
Of all the demon lords, Yeenoghu has made the great-
est mark on the Material Plane. During his rampage 
across the world eons ago, the race of gnolls sprang up 
in his wake. Every gnoll is a miniature embodiment of 
Yeenoghu's rage and hunger. They mimic their creator, 
killing any creatures that cross them and respecting 
only those that can withstand their fury. 
Cultists. Yeenoghu rarely acquires cultists other than 
gnolls, leucrottas, and the other creatures spawned by 
his incursions across the planes. The few humanoids 
that take up his worship are disaffected loners, many of 
them outcasts driven away from civilization. A cult of 
Yeenoghu operates like a pack of gnolls, regardless of 
what creatures make it up. Yeenoghu infuses them with 
a cannibalistic hunger, and they know that each victim 
they claim draws them closer to his presence. 
ZUGGTMOY 
The Demon Queen of Fungi has many traits similar to 
those ofJuiblex. Some sages believe she is the origi-
nator of all fungi and molds, from the mushrooms that 
grow in the forest to the deadliest forms of yellow mold. 
Those who study demons argue that Zuggtmoy isn't 
merely a patron of fungi, and that her ultimate goal is 
to meld all living creatures into one great organism, an 
entity that she will then join with and rule over. 
Cultists. Most of Zuggtmoy's cultists are hapless mor-
tals that have been infested with the demonic spores she 
cultivates in the fungi she created. The spores slowly de-
vour these creatures' brains, leaving them with enough 
functionality to spread malevolent fungi but robbing 
them of the will to turn against their master. 
A few mortals freely enter her service. Most are dru-
ids who want to exterminate civilization and replace it 
with wild plants and fungus, or deluded, power-hungry 
individuals who believe that they would retain their iden-
tities while they bring others under Zuggtmoy's thrall. 
Zuggtmoy allows these zealots to retain their existing 
forms if doing so furthers her aims and helps to spread 
her children far and wide, but they are destined for the 
same fate as all the others.
