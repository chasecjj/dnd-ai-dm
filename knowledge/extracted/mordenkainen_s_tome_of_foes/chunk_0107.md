CADAVER COLLECTOR 
The ancient war machines known as cadaver collectors 
lumber aimlessly across the blasted plains of Acheron 
until they are called upon by a necromancer, hobgoblin 
general, or other evil warlord to bolster the ranks of a 
conquering army. These fearsome constructs obey their 
summoners until being dismissed back to Acheron, but 
if a summoner comes to a bad end, a cadaver collector 
might wander the Material Plane for centuries, collect-
ing corpses while searching for a way to return home. 
Sweeping the Dead. Cadaver collectors respond to a 
summons from a mortal only when they are called to the 
scene of a great battle-either where one is in progress, 
where one is imminent, or where one once took place. 
They encase themselves in the armor and weapons of 
fallen warriors and impale the corpses of those warriors 
on the lances and other weapons embedded in their sal-
vaged armor. 
Cotfiured Berserkers. Corpses that accumulate on 
the construct's shell aren't just grisly battle trophies. 
A cadaver collector can summon the spirits of these 
cadavers to join battle with its enemies and to paralyze 
more creatures for eventual impalement. Although 
these specters are individually weak, a cadaver 
collector can call up an almost end-
less supply of them, if given time. 
Constructed Nature. A cadaver 
collector doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep.

Summon Specters (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). As a 
bonus action, the cadaver collector calls up the enslaved spirits 
of those it has slain; ld6 specters (without Sunlight Sensitivity) 
arise in unoccupied spaces within l 5 feet of the cadaver 
collector. The specters act right after the cadaver collector on 
the same initiative count and fight until they're destroyed. They 
disappear when the cadaver collector is destroyed. 
A CTIONS 
Multiattack. The cadaver collector makes two slam attacks. 
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 16 (3dl0) ne· 
erotic damage. 
Paralyzing Breath (Recharge 5- 6). The cadaver collector re-
leases paralyzing gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that 
area must make a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw 
or be paralyzed for l minute. A paralyzed creature repeats the 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 
on itself with a success.

CHOKER 
The choker is a subterranean predator far more dan-
gerous than its small size and spindly, rubbery limbs 
would suggest. 
Chokers have cartilage rather than a bony skeleton. 
This flexible internal structure enables them to easily 
slip into narrow fissures and niches in the walls of their 
cavern homes. They lurk in these spots, silent and un-
seen, waiting for prey to happen by. 
Sly Trappers. A choker's usual method for luring 
prey involves positioning the body of its latest catch just 
outside its hiding spot. Whenever it gets hungry, it tears 
off a few chunks of flesh to feed itself. In the meantime, 
the corpse serves to entice other curious humanoids-
explorers, drow, duergar, or the choker's favorite prey, 
goblins- to come within reach. 
When a target presents itself, the choker's star-
fish-shaped hands dart out of its hiding spot, wrap 
around the victim's throat, and pin the unfortunate crea-
ture against the cavern wall while choking out its life. 
Because its arms are so long, the choker can keep its 
body deep inside the crevice where it hides, beyond the 
reach of most normal weapons. 
Lone Hunters. Chokers tend to set their ambushes 
alone, rather than working in concert, but where one 
creature is found, others are likely to be nearby. They 
communicate through eerie, keening howls that travel 
long distances through rock but are difficult to identify 
or locate in a typical echo-filled cavern.

Boneless. The choker can move through and occupy a space as 
narrow as 4 inches wide without squeezing. 
Spider Climb. The choker can climb difficult surfaces, includ· 
ing upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 
ACTIONS 
• 
Multiattack. The choker makes two tentacle attacks. 
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one tar-
get. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing 
damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grap· 
pied (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is re-
strained, and the choker can't use this tentacle on another tar-
get. The choker has two tentacles. If this attack is a critical hit, 
the target also can't breathe or speak until the grapple ends.
