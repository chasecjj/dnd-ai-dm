WASTRILITH 
Found in the waters of the Abyss and other bod-
ies of water contaminated by the plane's fell influ-
ence, wastriliths establish themselves as lords of 
the deep and rule their dominions with cruelty. 
Despoilers. A wastrilith contaminates the wa-
ters around it. Its noxious presence even affects 
nearby sources of water when the demon travels 
on land. The corrupted water, which contains a 
measure of the demon's essence, responds to its 
commands- perhaps hardening to prevent foes 
from escaping, or erupting in a surge that drags 
would-be victims into its reach. 
Silent Corrupters. Creatures that ingest wa-
ter that has been corrupted by a wastrilith risk 
their very souls. Those who drink the poisonous 
liquid might wither away until they finally die, or 
remain alive only to become a thrall of chaos and 
evil. To represent this defilement, you can use the 
optional rule on abyssal corruption in chapter 2 
of the Dungeon Master's Guide, causing the poi-
soned creature to be corrupted.
