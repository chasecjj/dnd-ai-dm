STAR SPAWN LARVA MAGE 
A larva mage is a nightmarish combination of a mortal 
body and otherworldly substance. When a powerful 
cultist of a wormlike entity such as Kyuss or Kezef-
usually a warlock or other spellcaster- contacts the 
comet-borne emissary of an Elder Evil, the emissary 
can merge with a mortal consciousness to create a larva 
mage. None of the original cultist's personality survives 
the transformation, so what emerges is wholly alien.

Return to Worms. When the larva mage is reduced to 0 hit

space. Unless the swarm is destroyed, the larva mage reforms 
from it 24 hours later.

spawn within 10 feet of the larva mage must succeed on a DC

be blinded and restrained by masses of swarming worms. The 
affected creature takes 22 (Sd8) necrotic damage at the start 
of each of the larva mage's turns. The creature can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 
on itself on a success.

mage fails a saving throw, the larva mage gains 10 temporary 
hit points.
