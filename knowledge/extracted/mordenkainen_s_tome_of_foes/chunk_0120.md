Keepers of Forbidden Lore. Sibriexes have spent 
eons amassing information from across the planes, 
hoarding knowledge for when it might be useful. Such 
is their incredible intellect that many seek them out, in-
cluding demon lords. Some sibriexes act as advisors and 
oracles, manipulating demons into serving their ends, 
while other sibriexes cling to their secrets, parceling out 
lore only when doing so would advance their plans. 
Dem on Grafters. Sibriexes can channel the power of 
the Abyss to create new demons from other creatures. 
Over the course of days, they can create vast numbers 
of rutterkins to protect their lands and to ensure that 
the plane teems with destructive monsters. Some de-
mons petition sibriexes for physical gifts, and if they are 
moved to do so, sibriexes can graft on new body parts 
to give the demons greater strength, vision, or stamina. 
Sibriexes never give aid freely; they demand a service or 
a treasure in return for the flesh-shaping they provide. 
VARIANT: FLESH WARPING 
Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted be-
yond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving 
throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you 
can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping 
table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes 
when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the crea-
ture transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect be-
comes a permanent feature of that body. 
A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an 
agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the 
creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end 
of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one 
effect) to determine how the creature is transformed 
permanently.
