DERRO MADNESS 
All derro suffer from a form of madness that most often 
manifests as mania and paranoia, but other mental 
afflictions and strange tics also commonly affect them. 
Derro take little notice of odd behavior in their ranks, 
except when an individual displays the characteristics 
of a savant. They believe the strange behavior of savants 
arises because those leaders carry messages from Diir-
inka. You can use the Derro Madness table to generate 
one or more odd qualities for a derro NPC.

DEVILS 
Devils scheme and fight to reach the top of the infernal 
hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Several devils are intro-
duced here, some that have a place in the social order 
and others that stand apart from it. 
ABISHAI 
~~~~~~~~~-
Each abishai was once a mortal who somehow won Tia-
mat's favor before death and, as a reward, found its soul 
transformed into a hideous devil to serve at her pleasure 
in the Nine Hells. 
Emissaries of Doom . Tiamat deploys abishais as 
emissaries, sending them to represent her interests in 
the Hells and across the multiversc. Some have simple 
tasks, such as delivering a message to cultists or taking 
charge of worshipers to carry out a sensitive mission. 
Others have greater responsibilities, such as leading 
large groups, assassinating targets, and serving in 
armies. In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyalty to 
Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed. 
Outsiders in Hell. Abishais stand outside the normal 
hierarchy of the Nine Hells, having their own chain of 
command and ultimately answering to Tiamat 
(and Asmodeus, when the dark lord chooses 
to use them). Other archdevils can command 
abishais to work for them, but most archdevils 
do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an 
abishai follows Tiamat's orders or Asmodeus's. 
There is inherent risk in countermanding an 
order given by Tiamat, but interfering with As-
modeus's plans invites certain destruction. 
BLACK ABISHAI 
Expert assassins and infiltrators, black 
abishais can weave shadows to mask their 
presence, allowing them to reach a location 
from where they can deliver a fatal strike to 
their targets.
