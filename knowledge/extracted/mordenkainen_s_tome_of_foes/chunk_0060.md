ISLAND OF STABILITY 
A well-built stronghold is an easily managed, tranquil 
environment where dwarves focus on rearing their 
families and pursuing their craft. Since the beginnings 
of their existence, dwarves have carved out their strong-
holds underground for a variety of reasons. Their un-
matched prowess in mining and stonework makes them 
ideal candidates to use the subterranean realm for living 
quarters- and considering their outlook on the rest of 
the world, the dwarves wouldn't have it any other way. 
The stronghold's remoteness isolates the dwarves 
from the vagaries of politics and other forms of turmoil 
in the surface world. Underground, they don't have 
to contend with the changing of the seasons, or even 
daily variations in the weather, so that one day inside a 
stronghold is much like any other day. The activities of 
the clan are governed by a firm schedule that provides 
every member with daily time for work, family, and per-
sonal enrichment. The forges are never allowed to go 
cold, and the mines around the stronghold are worked 
every hour of every day. 
B EAUTIFUL ON THE INSIDE 
Dwarves are acutely aware that their reputation as 
skilled miners and crafters of beautiful works of art 
makes any stronghold a prime target for thieves and 
raiders. For that reason, the entrance to a stronghold 
doesn't broadcast its presence by being a stellar ex-
ample of dwarven stonework. The outer precincts of a 
clan's home are plain and functional, decorated min-
imally or not at all, to give visitors and those passing

nearby no reason to suspect what lies in the deeper 
chambers. From what they see, a dwarven stronghold is 
well built but austere. 
The greatest treasures crafted by a clan are seques-
tered in the innermost chambers of the stronghold, 
behind secret doors in areas that are open to clan mem-
bers but forbidden to all outsiders. Even dwarves from 
other clans are granted access to such a place only after 
earning the trust of their hosts. 
These inner precincts hold the stuff of a thief's wildest 
dreams. In one chamber, gold foil lines the ceiling of 
an immense hall, carefully worked with diamonds that 
mimic the stars at night. In another, jewels are used to 
form wondrous murals that tell of the clan's greatest 
deeds. A clan's feasting hall might be stocked with uten-
sils and place settings made of silver and gold. 
D EFENSE COMES FIRST 
Every dwarf knows instinctively that clan and strong-
hold are inextricably tied together- if one comes un-
done, the other fails as well. As such, defending the 
stronghold is a concern that the dwarves address even 
in the earliest stages of construction. They plan and 
then build with the goals of safety and security upper-
most in mind. And the only way that a home can be truly 
safe and secure is if it is protected against intruders. 
Dwarves use a variety of approaches and devices in 
setting their defenses. The strongholds of many clans 
are honeycombed with secret passages designed to 
enable the dwarves to ambush and flank enemies. 
Dwarves also make liberal use of secret doors fashioned
