tributed to her descent into an unquenchable sorrow. At 
the same time, the energy of the corrupted ritual was 
still transforming her, breaking down her form from a 
physical one into an entity composed of symbols, im-
ages, and perceptions. To keep herself from dissipating 
entirely into nothingness, the queen used the last ves-
tiges of her personal power to pull dead memories from 
the Shadowfell about her, creating a cloak of identities 
that sustained her. Over centuries, those dark memories 
accumulated and coalesced to give shape to the entity 
now known as the Raven Queen. 
THE FORTRESS OF MEMORIES 
Since achieving divinity, the Raven Queen has filled 
her realm with shadows and memories, obsessively col-
lecting such essences from remnants of dead gods and 
mortals that were strewn throughout the Shadowfell. 
From these metaphysical fragments she formed her 
new home, a twisted castle that the shadar-kai call the 
Fortress of Memories. The fortress is a mournful place, 
filled with incessant echoes of the past. Flocks of ravens 
that act as her eyes and ears darken the skies around it 
when they emerge from within, bearing her cryptic mes-
sages and omens far and wide across the multiverse. 
Bizarre Menagerie. Within the Fortress of Memo-
ries are trinkets and items that the Raven Queen finds 
irresistible, memories plucked from people's pasts that 
have been invested with deep feelings of pain, sorrow, 
longing, guilt, or remorse. These items are brought to 
her as gifts from the shadar-kai. These trinkets can 
include furniture, clocks, mirrors, jewels, and toys. Also 
appearing in the fortress are ghostly visions of people, 
places, and pets. Any of these things can spontaneously 
appear about her lair, every object and apparition being 
a metaphoric representation of some story- great or 
small- that was saturated with raw emotion. 
ENCOUNTERING THE R AVEN QUEEN 
Mortals that enter the Raven Queen's realm are almost 
instantly confronted with a glimpse into their own inter-
nal landscape. Because she is fascinated with emotions, 
the Raven Queen worms into the unconscious minds 
and memories of her visitors, bringing forth visions 
from the deepest reaches of their psyches. Some of 
these visitors are the unwitting souls of departed people 
who have been pulled into the Raven Queen's clutches, 
others are astral travelers who are caught and trapped 
within the Shadowfell by her magic- but a rare few 
come of their own volition, seeking knowledge or free-
dom from a dark past. 
A Q UEST TO T HE FO RTRESS OF M EMORIES 
Because the Raven Queen has godlike power, she can put 
an adventuring party inside a demiplane that is created 
from the psyche of one of the characters. On entering the 
Fortress of Memories, or encountering the Raven Queen, 
a character can find themselves transported to a strange 
fairy tale world pulled from their experiences, filled with 
metaphors, parables and allegories, all of which challenge 
that character's frailties, fears, and desires. Much can be 
learned from adventuring within the fortress and under· 
going the Raven Queen's test, but much can also be lost. 
Many adventurers never return from the fortress, forever 
trapped within a world created from their own experience.
