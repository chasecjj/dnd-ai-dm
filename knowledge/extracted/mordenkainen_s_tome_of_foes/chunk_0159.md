ELADRIN 
Eladrin dwell in the verdant splendor of the Feywild. 
They are related to the elves found on the Material 
Plane, and resemble them in both their love of beauty 
and the value they place on personal freedom. But 
where other elves can temper their wild impulses, 
eladrin are creatures ruled by emotion- and because 
of their unique magical nature, they undergo physical 
changes to match their changes in temperament. 
The eladrin have spent centuries in the Feywild, and 
most of them have become fey creatures as a result. 
Some of them are still humanoid, similar in that respect 
to their other elven kin. The eladrin presented here are 
of the fey variety. 
Creatures of Passion. The magic flowing through 
eladrin responds to their emotional state by transform-
ing them into different seasonal aspects, with behaviors 
and capabilities that change with their forms. Some 
eladrin might remain in a particular aspect for years, 
while others run through the emotional spectrum 
each week. 
Lovers of Beauty. Regardless of the aspect they ex-
press, eladrin love beauty and surround themselves with 
lovely things. Eladrin try to possess any objects they find 
striking. They might seek to own a painting, a statue, or 
a glittering jewel. When they encounter people of comely 
form or luminous spirit, they use their magic to delight 
those folk or, in the case of evil eladrin, to abduct them. 
AUTUMN ELADRIN 
Eladrin often enter the autumn season when they are 
overcome by feelings of goodwill. In this aspect, they 
defuse conflicts and alleviate suffering by using their 
magic to heal, to cure, and to relieve any ailment that 
might afflict the people who come to them for aid. 
They tolerate no violence in their presence and move 
quickly to settle disputes, to ensure that peace contin-
ues to reign. 
SPRING ELADRIN 
Their hearts filled with joy, spring eladrin cavort 
through their sylvan realms, their songs and laughter 
filling the air. These playful eladrin beguile other crea-
tures to fill them with the joy of spring. Their antics 
can lead other creatures into danger and make mis-
chief for them. 
SUMMER ELADRIN 
When they are angered, eladrin enter the season of sum-
mer, a burning, tempestuous state that transforms them 
into aggressive warriors eager to vent their wrath. Their 
magic responds to their fury and amplifies their fighting 
ability, which helps them move with astonishing quick-
ness and strike with terrible force. 
WINTER ELADRIN 
When sorrow distresses elaclrin, they enter the winter 
season, becoming figures of melancholy and bitterness. 
Frozen tears drop from their cheeks, and their palpable 
sadness emanates from them as bitter cold. 
CHANGEABLE N ATURE 
Whenever one of the eladrin presented here finishes a long 
rest, it can associate itself with a different season, pro-
vided it isn't incapacitated. When the eladrin makes this 
change, it uses the stat block of the new season, rather 
than its old stat block. Any damage the eladrin sustained 
in its original form applies to the new form, as do any con-
ditions or other ongoing effects affecting it.

Enchanting Presence. Any non-eladrin creature that starts its 
turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed 
by the eladrin for l minute. On a successful save, the crea-
ture becomes immune to any eladrin's Enchanting Presence 
for 24 hours. 
Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the charmed creature, 
the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on 
itself on a success. 
Fey Step (Recharge 4- 6). As a bonus action, the eladrin can 
teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. 
Innate Spe/lcasting. The eladrin's innate spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following 
spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: calm emotions, sleep 
3/day each: cure wounds (as a 5th-level spell), lesser restoration 
l/day each: greater restoration, heal, raise dead 
Magic Resistance. The eladrin has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one tar-
get. Hit: S (ld8 + 1) slashing damage, or 6 (ldlO + 1) slashing 
damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (4d8) psychic damage. 
Longbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 150/600 
ft., one target. Hit: 7 (ld8 + 3) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) 
psychic damage. 
REACTIONS 
Foster Peace. If a creature charmed by the eladrin hits with an 
attack roll while within 60 feet of the eladrin, the eladrin mag-
ically causes the attack to miss, provided the eladrin can see 
the attacker.
