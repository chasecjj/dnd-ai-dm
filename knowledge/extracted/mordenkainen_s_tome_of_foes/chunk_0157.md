DUERGAR WARLORD 
A warlord is cunning, inspiring, and cruel in equal parts. 
A skilled warrior who leads duergar into battle, the war-
lord can use spikes of psionic energy to compel duergar 
warriors to fight harder. 
D uERGAR XARRORN 
The xarrorn are specialists who construct weapons us-
ing a mixture of alchemy and psionics.

Duergar Resilience. The duergar has advantage on saving 
throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist 
being charmed or paralyzed. 
Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the duergar has 
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks that rely on sight. 
ACTIONS 
Fire Lance. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit (with disadvantage 
ifthe target is within 5 feet of the duergar), reach 10 ft., one 
target. Hit: 9 (ld12 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (ld6) fire dam-
age, or 16 (2d12 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (ld6) fire damage 
while enlarged. 
Fire Spray (Recharge 5-6). From its fire lance, the duergar 
shoots a 15-foot cone of fire or a line of fire 30 feet long and 
5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). For 1 minute, 
the duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it 
is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, 
doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks 
(included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and 
Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar lacks the 
room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in 
the space available. 
Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The duergar 
magically turns invisible for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it 
casts a spell, it uses its Enlarge, or its concentration is broken 
(as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar 
wears or carries is invisible with it. 
EIDOLON 
The gods have many methods for protecting sites they 
deem holy. One servant they rely on often to do so is 
the eidolon, a ghostly spirit bound by a sacred oath to 
safeguard a place of import to the divine. Forged from 
the souls of those who had proven their unwavering 
devotion, eidolons stalk temples and vaults, places 
where miracles have been witnessed and relics en-
shrined, to ensure that no enemy can gain a foothold 
against the gods' cause through defilement or violence 
within these sites. If an enemy with such intent sets 
foot inside a warded location, the eidolon plunges into a 
graven vessel, a statue specially prepared to house the 
souls of these protectors. The eidolon then animates 
the effigy and uses the borrowed body to drive out the 
intruders bent on plundering the relics it is charged 
with guarding. 
Sacred Guardians. Creating an eidolon requires a 
spirit of fanatical devotion-that of an individual who, in 
life, served with unwavering faithfulness. Upon death, 
a god might reward such a follower with everlasting 
service in the protection of a holy site. An eidolon has no 
purpose beyond guarding the place it was assigned to 
and never leaves. 
Animated Statues. An eidolon has few methods for 
protecting itself beyond its ability to awaken its sacred 
vessels. When a foe enters, the eidolon leaps into action 
by merging its body with one of several statues at the 
site. After doing so, the eidolon controls the construct 
as if it was its own body and uses its fists to drive back 
intruders, smashing and crushing anything it can reach. 
Undead Nature. An eidolon doesn't require air, food, 
drink, or sleep.
