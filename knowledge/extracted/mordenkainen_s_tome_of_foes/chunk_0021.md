LORDS A ND THEIR THRALLS 
While the demons fight for domination among their 
own kind in the Abyss, the Material Plane is the most 
fertile ground for demons to acquire followers. Even a 
relatively weak demon can demand obedience and wor-
ship from humans and other mortals through the threat 
of force. In turn, its magical abilities allow it to impart 
boons to its servants, making them more useful and bet-
ter able to pursue the demon's goal in the world. 
Sects dedicated to the worship of the various demon 
lords are spread across the mortal worlds of the multi-
verse as well as the Abyss. In return for a cult's adora-
tion, a demon receives allies in its struggle against its 
rivals. To show their reverence, cultists might offer sac-
rifices of treasure and magic items that the demon can 
use. Taking advantage of that same reverence, a demon 
might send its cultists into battle to soften up an enemy 
before the demon enters the fray itself. 
Many cultists gravitate to a demon lord out of a desire 
for power. Others find themselves captivated by a de-
mon's narcissism, so that their minds and worldviews 
become twisted into a pale version of their master's. 
BAPHOMET 
Known as the Horned King, Baphomet divides the crea-
tures of the world into two groups. Those who acknowl-
edge his power are his servants, and he endows them 
with savagery and a hunter's cunning. The rest are prey, 
creatures to be hunted and slaughtered. His aim is to 
transform the cosmos into his personal hunting ground. 
Baphomet is a savage entity, but he tempers his feroc-
ity with shrewdness. He loves the hunt and the sense 
of impending doom that comes over prey that can't es-
cape his pursuit. His fondness for labyrinths, instilled 
in the minotaurs he created, reflects this aspect of his 
personality. Baphomet studies every detail of the mazes 
he creates and exults in the dread that overcome those 
who become lost in them. He tracks them at his leisure, 
striking only after the maze's contorted corridors have 
exhausted the energy and the hope of his victims. 
Cultists. The cult of Baphomet attracts those who see 
themselves as superior to everyone else, to the extent 
that they consider other people little more than animals. 
Baphomet's teachings reinforce these beliefs, appealing 
to the ego and justifying narcissism. Bigots are also 
drawn to Baphomet's doctrine of individual superiority. 
Cultists of Baphomet include nobles who use their 
vassals as playthings, assassins who practice their 
murderous art for the sheer love of hunting intelligent 
creatures, and paranoid humans who combine a hatred 
of outsiders with bloodthirstiness. 
Typically, a cult builds a maze beneath a castle, a guild 
hall, or some other place it controls. The cultists drug 
their victims, strip them of their weapons and armor, 
and place them in the labyrinth before they wake up dis-
oriented. Then the cultists stalk their prey in the maze. 
They howl as they chase their quarry, striking fear into 
their victims' hearts before descending for the kill. If the 
hunt claims a particularly powerful creature, Baphomet 
might bestow boons on the cultists as a reward. 
LOLTH EXTENDS H ER WEBS 
The Demon Queen of Spiders and her brood rarely take 
part directly in the Blood War; rather, her agents in the 
Abyss contrive to lure her enemies into throwing them-
selves into the struggle. Her servitors spy on both sides, 
playing demon and devil against each other. 
Lolth's plan, as far as those who study the Abyss under· 
stand it, is to tempt her rival demon lords into venturing 
onto other planes or to send them away with powerful 
magic. Because it is in the demons' nature to spread and 
destroy, they rampage in their new environs instead of 
seeking revenge on Lolth. Lolth, in turn, delights in filling 
the vacancy left by a departed rival, expanding the reach of 
the Demonweb Pits and claiming those servants her ene· 
mies have left behind as new spies and informants for her. 
D EMO GORGON 
The Prince of Demons is a being of unfettered violence 
and rage, the mightiest of the demon lords. His twin 
heads, Aameul and Hathradiah, compete in some ways 
and cooperate in others. The result is an entity that is 
capable of devising and enacting the most clever strat-
egies, paranoid at all times about threats to his rule 
(which certainly exist in the chaos of the Abyss), and 
possessed of immense physical power. 
Demogorgon prefers to meets every challenge with 
overwhelming force and to ferret out enemies long be-
fore they can marshal the strength to make a serious 
stand against him. He sees every living creature as a 
potential threat- and only those who debase themselves 
before him have a chance of escaping his wrath. 
His ultimate goal is to empty the multiverse of all 
other creatures, even his cultists. Free from any pros-
pect of being betrayed or insulted, he can finally rest in a 
perfectly peaceful cosmos. According to one hypothesis, 
if Demogorgon were ever to achieve this end, his two 
heads would finally fight to the death, each devouring 
the other and leaving behind nothing but a void. 
Cultists. Demons comprise the majority of Demogor-
gon's cultists, since he commands unmatched power 
in the Abyss. The mere sight of him anywhere in that 
realm can transfix lesser demons and instantly compel 
them to do his bidding. 
In mortal realms, people can fall under his sway sim-
ply by laying eyes on a true copy of his symbol, crafted 
either by Demogorgon or one of his most powerful de-
monic followers. An individual exposed to such a symbol 
becomes an agent of Demogorgon, dedicated ever after 
to a life of lurking in the shadows, lashing out against 
unsuspecting victims and striking fear into those who 
discover the bodies left behind.
