Intelligence (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following 
spells, requiring no material components:

Magic Resistance. The eladrin has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
Sorrowful Presence. Any non-eladrin creature that starts its 
turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 13 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed 
by the eladrin for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the 
creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws. 
The charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end 
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If 
a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, 
the creature is immune to any eladrin's Sorrowful Presence for 
the next 24 hours. 
Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the charmed creature, 
it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on 
a success.

ELDER ELEMENTALS 
On their native planes, elementals sweep across the 
weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess 
greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and 
adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to 
their own until they become something extraordinary. 
When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as 
beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere ex-
istence promises destruction. 
Deadly When Summoned. The methods for sum-
moning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden 
tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to 
honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of super-
lative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth 
one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often de-
stroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and 
nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attempt such 
a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward ' 
some cataclysmic end. 
Elemental Nature. An elder elemental doesn't require 
air, food, drink, or sleep.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the leviathan fails a saving 
throw, it can choose to succeed instead. 
Partial Freeze. If the leviathan takes 50 cold damage or more 
during a single turn, the leviathan partially freezes; until the 
end of its next turn, its speeds are reduced to 20 feet, and it 
makes attack rolls with disadvantage. 
Siege Monster. The leviathan deals double damage to objects 
and structures (included in Tidal Wave). 
Water Form. The leviathan can enter a hostile creature's space 
and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 
inch wide without squeezing. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The leviathan makes two attacks: one with its 
slam and one with its tail. 
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one tar-
get. Hit: 15 (ldlO + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (ldlO) 
acid damage. 
CHAPTER 6 I .BESTIARY 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: + 16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one tar-
get. Hit: 16 (ld12 + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 6 (ld12) 
acid damage. 
Tidal Wave (Recharge 6). While submerged, the leviathan mag-
ically creates a wall of water centered on itself. The wall is up 
250 feet long, up to 250 feet high, and up to 50 feet thick. 
When the wall appears, all other creatures within its area 
must each make a DC 24 Strength saving throw. A creature 
takes 33 (6dl0) bludgeoning damage on failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 
At the start of each of the leviathan's turns after the wall 
appears, the wall, along with any other creatures in it, moves 
50 feet away from the leviathan. Any Huge or smaller creature 
inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves 
must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or take 27 
(5d10) bludgeoning damage. A creature takes this damage 
no more than once on a turn. At the end of each turn the wall 
moves, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage 
creatures take from the wall on subsequent rounds is reduced 
by ldlO. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the effect ends. 
A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Be-
cause of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make 
a successful DC 24 Strength (Athletics) check to swim at all 
during that turn. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The leviathan can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the 
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used 
at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The le-
viathan regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. 
Slam (Costs 2 Actions). The leviathan makes one slam attack. 
Move. The leviathan moves up to its speed.
