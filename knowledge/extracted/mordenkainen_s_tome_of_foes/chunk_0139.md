CHAPTER 6 I BESTTARY 
MERREGON 
The souls of fallen soldiers, mercenaries, and body-
guards who served evil without reservation often find 
everlasting servitude in the Nine Hells as merregons. 
These faceless foot soldiers are the hells' legionnaires, 
tasked with protecting the realm and its rulers against 
intruders. 
Masks of Uniformity. Merregons have no individu-
ality, and hence no need for faces. Every merregon le-
gionnaire has a metal mask bolted to its head. Markings 
on the mask indicate the only elements of the wearer's 
identity that matter: its commander and the layer of the 
Nine Hells it serves. 
Fearless Obedience. Because of their unshakable 
loyalty, merregons form the backbone of many devils' 
protective retinues. They shrink from no task, no matter 
how dangerous. Unless ordered to fall back, they retreat 
from no fight.

NARZUGON 
Paladins who make deals with devils and carry their 
twisted sense of honor into the afterlife are especially 
valuable to the archdukes of the Nine Hells, who want 
unquestioning champions to lead their legions in war. 
These narzugons, wielding lances of hellfire and riding 
nightmare steeds like horrific perversions of knights 
errant, roam across the infernal layers and other planes 
to carry out the will of their masters.

• 
Diabolical Sense. The narzugon has advantage on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks made to perceive good-aligned creatures. 
Infernal Tack. The narzugon wears spurs that are part of infer-
nal tack, which allow it to summon its nightmare companion. 
Magic Resistance. The narzugon has advantage on saving 
throws against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The narzugon uses its Infernal Command or Terri-
fying Command. It also makes three hellfire lance attacks. 
Hel!fire Lance. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., 
one target. Hit: 11 (ldl2 + 5) piercing damage plus 16 (3dl0) 
fire damage. If this damage kills a creature, the creature's soul 
rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in ld4 hours. 
If the creature isn't revived before then, only a wish spell or 
killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's 
original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are 
immune to this effect. 
Infernal Command. Each ally of the narzugon within 60 feet of 
it can't be charmed or frightened until the end of the narzu-
gon's next turn. 
Terrifying Command. Each creature that isn't a fiend within 60 
feet of the narzugon that can hear it must succeed on a DC 17 
Charisma saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. 
A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that 
makes a successful saving throw is immune to this narzugon's 
Te rrifying Command for 24 hours. 
Healing (1/Day). The narzugon, or one creature it touches, re-
gains up to 100 hit points. 
Death in Hellfire. A narzugon's lances are forged 
in hellfire. The soul of anyone killed by such a lance is 
shunted to the River Styx for rebirth as a lemure. Each 
lance is unique to its owner, bearing the marks of both 
the narzugon and its master. 
Nightmare Riders. Each narzugon claims a night-
mare as its mount. These nightmares are bound by 
infernal tack (see the sidebar) and must respond to sum-
mons and commands from the wearer of the spurs. 
M AG IC ITEM: INFE RNAL T ACK 
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature 
of evil alignment) 
A narzugon binds a nightmare to its service with infernal 
tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, 
and spurs. A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must 
serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the 
tack is removed. 
You can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with 
infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping 
them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of 
your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and 
takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, 
until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If 
the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 
hours, after which you can summon it again. 
The tack doesn't conjure a nightmare from thin air; one 
must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No 
nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some 
eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and be-
come true partners in evil.
