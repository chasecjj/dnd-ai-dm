THREE PATHS TO POWER 
Rank-and-file devils have three ways of ascending 
through the ranks. The Nine Hells uses a complex sys-
tem of rules to quantify and recognize a devil's deeds. 
S ouls. Each time a devil signs a contract that pledges 
a mortal's soul to the Nine Hells, that devil receives 
credit for the achievement. A stronger soul, such as a 
mighty warrior who leaves mortality behind to become 
an ice devil, is worth more than a simple peasant likely 
to be consigned to existence as a lemure. 
Glory. All devils are required to fight in the Blood 
War. Every low-ranking devil spends at least some time 
on the front lines as part of a legion. Some find combat 
enticing and volunteer for extra missions. Others are 
content to do only the minimum needed to fulfill their 
obligations, but they fight just as furiously when they 
are engaged. A devil receives credit for each foe it slays. 
based on the worthiness of the opponent and whether 
the devil scored the kill alone or with the help of others. 
Treachery.Just as the law has complex rules for the 
promotion of devils under normal circumstances, it also 
includes contingencies for how to fill a sudden vacancy 
in the upper ranks. Vaulting into the position formerly 
occupied by one's superior is the fastest means of ad-
vancement available to a devil. A devil that successfully 
arranges for a superior's death can immediately step 
into the vacant role, as long as the devil is aware of the 
rules of succession and positions itself as next in line. 
DIABOLICAL CULTS 
Cults dedicated to infernal beings are the foes of adven-
turers throughout the D&D multiverse. This section 
gives the DM ways to customize the members of cults 
dedicated to the powers of the Nine Hells. 
Every archdevil attracts a certain type of person 
based on the gifts the devil offers. In the following cult 
descriptions, stat blocks from the Monster Manual are 
suggested in a cult's Typical Cultist entry to help you 
represent those people. 
Each description also includes a list of signature 
spells associated with the cult. If a cult member can cast 
spells, you can replace any of those spells with spells 
from that list, as long as the new spell is of the same 
level as the spell it replaces. 
The customization options here will typically have no 
appreciable effect on the challenge rating of a creature 
that gains them. 
CHAPTER I I TH F. BLOOD WAR 
CULT OF ASMODEUS 
Asmodeus demands the loyalty of all cultists who gain 
power and leadership in the cults of the Nine. His cult 
subsumes all the others. 
Any NPC who leads a diabolical cult must acknowl-
edge the power of Asmodeus. In return, the most worthy 
of those leaders gain the Demands of Nessus trait. 
Demands of Nessus. At the start of each of this creature's turns, 
this creature can choose one ally it can see within 30 feet ofit. 
The chosen ally loses 10 hit points, and this creature regains 
the same number of hit points. If the creature is incapacitated, 
it makes no choice; instead, the closest ally within 30 feet is the 
chosen ally. 
CULT OF BAALZEBUL 
Goals: Restoration of honor and respect, at the cost of 
those who stole it 
Typical Cultist: Any NPC or monster that has suffered a 
fall from grace 
Signature Spells: Minor illusion (cantrip), disguise self 
(1st level), phantasmal force (2nd level), major image 
(3rd level) 
Baalzebul typically recruits individuals rather than 
cults. He offers hope to those whose failures drive them 
to seek redemption. 
He grants a boon, the Path of Baalzebul trait, that al-
lows a favored cultist to look good in the aftermath of an 
ally's failure. 
Path of Baa/zebu/. As a bonus action on its turn, this creature 
can choose one ally it can see within 30 feet of it. Until the start 
of this creature's next turn, it gains advantage on all ability 
checks and attack rolls, while the chosen ally suffers disadvan-
tage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. 
CULT OF DISPATER 
Goals: Power gained and used in secret, influence 
exerted via blackmail, control of people and orga-
nizations through knowledge of their weaknesses 
and shames 
Typical Cultist: Acolyte, bandit, bandit captain, cult fa-
natic, cultist, mage, noble, spy 
Signature Spells: Guidance (cantrip), identify (1st level), 
see invisibility (2nd level), clairvoyance (3rd level) 
Dispater trades in secrets, offering them in return for a 
creature's soul. His cults typically trade secrets to devils 
in return for other information. They often hatch con-
spiracies aimed at toppling and replacing governments 
or religious orders.
