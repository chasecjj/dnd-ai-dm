culture, although the githyanki have no priests or clerics 
of normal sort. 
Two aspects of their nature set knights apart from 
other githyanki. Each knight wields a cherished silver 
greatsword that imparts special powers to its owner, 
and the knights are among the few githyanki who can 
not only travel psionically between planes, but can also 
take allies along with them. Knights often emerge from 
planar travel astride the backs of red dragons, which 
have been serving the githyanki as allies ever since their 
time of enslavement under the mind flayers. 
SILVER SWORDS 
The first silver swords were created eons ago, when the 
gith were still a single race, by those who would become 
the first githyanki knights. A silver sword, which func-
tions as a +3 greatsword, is a conduit through which its 
wielder can assail a foe both physically and psychically. 
The weapon is particularly effective on the Astral Plane 
against any travelers who are connected to their phys-
ical bodies by a silver cord- a strike against such an 
enemy has a chance of severing the silver cord, causing 
instant death. 
Knights and their silver swords arc inseparable, and 
a knight will fight to the death to prevent the loss of its 
weapon. If a silver sword falls into the possession of 
someone other than a githyanki, Vlaakith sends a squad 
of knights out from Tu'narath to destroy the malefactor 
and recover the weapon. 
DRAGON STEEDS 
The relationship between githyanki and red dragons has 
remained basically unchanged since ancient times. Un-
der the terms of the alliance with Tia mat, a small cadre 
of dragons serve as cohorts and mounts for knights . 
and other high-ranking githyanki. The dragons remain 
above githyanki politics. They obey the orders of their

This magic weapon grants a +3 bonus to attack and dam-

advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving

riders and fulfill their terms of service without offering 
opinions or advice. 
Red dragons typically serve the githyanki during their 
younger years. Once a dragon reaches adulthood, it is 
dismissed and replaced with a younger dragon, taking 
with it the loot it has accumulated on raids. 
Since dragons don't age while on the Astral Plane, 
they don't grow in size or capability. In order to become 
both stronger and richer, they prefer to spend as much 
time as possible engaged in raids on the Material Plane 
or other realms. The best duty of all for a dragon is be-
ing tasked to guard a githyanki creche on the Material 
Plane, a posting that could last for years. Not only does 
it receive treasure as compensation, the dragon ages 
normally while completing its service, so that it reaches 
adulthood sooner than the dragon cohorts that are sta-
tioned in Tu'narath. 
The dragons that are bound to serve githyanki con-
sider their assignment an irritant but aren't hostile. 
They resent their masters, but the promise of loot 
makes them eager to participate in raids. As part of the 
compact with Tiamat, the githyanki are forbidden from 
using psionics or magic to compel their dragon allies' 
actions or read their minds. A dragon remains a loyal 
ally as long as its riders and handlers treat it with re-
spect and it gets plenty of opportunities to pillage. 
TERROR FROM THE SKY 
WE PRAISED PELOR WHEN WE REALIZED THE SHAPES 
above us were not dragons. We cursed him when we saw 
they were the airships of the githyanki.

Marshal of the Eastern Reach 
During the great war between the mind flayers and the 
gith, one of the githyanki's greatest achievements was 
their discovery of the magic that mind flayers used to 
produce and propel the flying vessels that the illithids 
used to travel between worlds. 
Now, the githyanki scour the worlds of the Materia~ 
Plane in their versions of those craft. Their astral ships 
are ideal for carrying troops and the spoils of their 
raids. Their wizards' divination magic seeks out great 
treasures. Under the guidance ofVlaakith, the supreme 
leaders organize raiding parties and dispatch them to 
return with the spoils of war.
