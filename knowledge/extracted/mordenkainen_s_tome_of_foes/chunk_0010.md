the planes play a key role in the struggle. Both sides 
sometimes employ adventurers to seek out knowledge 
that could free Levistus or allow Geryon to vanquish 
him and ascend to the lordship. 
Geryon fulfills his responsibilities in the soul trade by 
continuing to court mortals through his agents, offering 
them superior strength and great physical prowess in 
return for their allegiance. 
A FROZEN WASTELAND 
Every other layer of the Nine Hells has a function related 
to warfare, industry, administration, or commerce, but 
Stygia is an expanse of untamed, unimproved territory. 
Even so, it has its uses. All manner of unlikely beasts 
wander the frozen terrain and swim the seas, including 
remorhazes, krakens, mammoths, and even a few tribes 
of frost giants. These denizens have no fear of any other 
creatures, including devils, which makes the place an 
ideal proving ground. Lesser devils that need to sharpen 
their combat skills or improve their endurance before re-
porting to Avernus for duty in the Blood War spend time 
in Stygia. The cruelly cold environment, combined with 
the constant threat of attack, helps commanders assess 
their troops and place them into the various legions as 
appropriate for the skills they demonstrate. 
The presence of so many creatures native to the Ma-
terial Plane has led to speculation that Stygia was not 
always a layer of the Hells, but was previously a world 
on the Material Plane. Its inhabitants, facing annihila-
tion, are said to have pledged their souls and their world 
to Asmodeus in return for a safe haven- whereupon 
Asmodeus kept his end of the bargain by transporting 
the world into the Hells. The archmage Tzunk has re-
searched the topic extensively but has yet to find any 
evidence that truly confirms the account. If the supposi-
tion is true, then the riches of that world might lie under 
miles of ice and beneath frigid, monster-infested seas. 
GLASYA 
OF COURSE I LOVE MY FATHER. WITHOUT HIM, WHOM 
would I have to strive against? 
-Glasya 
Malbolge is the prison of the Nine Hells, and on this 
layer dwells its most infamous criminal. Glasya, the 
rebellious daughter of Asmodeus, rules the place and 
oversees the punishments doled out to devils that stray 
from their assigned tasks. These lawbreakers are put 
on trial in Phlegethos, and if they are found guilty they 
are dispatched to Malbolge to endure years of torment. 
That Glasya is both prison warden and the Nine Hells' 
most notorious criminal is evidence that in the infernal 
realms, crime pays as long as you avoid being convicted. 
PRISON AND TORTURE CHAMBER 
Malbolge comprises one infinitely large, steep-sloped 
mountain. Boulders and other debris rain down from its 
heights in frequent avalanches. Some of the structures 
here are erected atop pillars of adamantine embedded 
in the mountain that can withstand the constant batter-
ing, though the platforms they support sway under the 
CHAPTER 1 I THE .BLOOD WAR 
DEVILS A ND GEN DER 
To a devil, gender is insignificant. Devils can't create new 
life through physical means; a new devil comes into being 
only when a soul is corrupted or claimed in a bargain, and 
the gender of the mortal that provided the soul is immate-
rial. Devils that represent themselves to mortals are likely 
to adopt an appearance (including an apparent gender) 
that conforms with what those mortals believe to be true. 
Gender (and the assumptions that mortals make about it) 
is just another tool for devils to use to get what they want. 
Devils that are known to and named by mortals often 
accept the gender assigned to them, but they aren't bound 
by that label. Stories of the Lords of the Nine told by 
mortals might speak of Glasya as Asmodeus's daughter 
and Belial as Fierna's consort, but such expressions can't 
encompass the complexities of the strange relationships 
formed by beings of immortal evil. 
force of the onslaught. Condemned devils are typically 
trapped in cages, which are lowered on chains to hang 
beneath the platforms. From such a vantage, the prison-
ers are continually battered by Malbolge's avalanches, 
causing injuries that are agonizing but never fatal. 
Some locations on the mountain are shielded from 
the rockfall by structures that have projections pointing 
upslope so that avalanches wash around the protected 
areas beneath. Roofed trenches and tunnels make travel 
between locations possible, if perilous. 
A SINGULAR ICONOCLAST 
Of all the Lords of the Nine, Glasya is the most unpre-
dictable. She flaunts the rules of tradition and bends 
the Jaw without breaking it. She delights in shocking 
others by springing gambits that catch them unaware. 
Mortals who go up against overwhelming odds with an 
audacious plan attract her attention and could win her 
respect and patronage. 
The reason behind Glasya's rise to lordship is the 
subject of much whispered debate in the Nine Hells. It 
is generally known that Asmodeus presented Glasya to 
the Lords of the Nine as his daughter, and she toured 
the Nine Hells on his behalf. While doing so, she put her 
own plans into motion, much to the surprise of the other 
archdevils. Even before Glasya assumed the rulership 
of Malbolge, she established the Hells' first organized 
crime syndicate, using her followers to purchase souls 
on her behalf while paying for them with what amounted 
to worthless coin. 
Was it Asmodeus's intent all along that Glasya should 
strike out on her own, or was Glasya rebellious and 
clever enough to successfully defy her father? Was 
Glasya's rise to power an unforeseen benefit of her 
machinations, or is it a great embarrassment to Asmo-
deus? Likely only the two of them know the truth. 
Corn LEGIONS 
Taking a cue from the sword, shield, and dreg legions 
into which the devils' armies are grouped, Glasya estab-
lished a new category of "legion" to realize her plans for 
profit and power: the coin legions. 
The members of Glasya's coin legions operate in the 
manner of thieves' guilds on the Material Plane. They 
have one critical advantage compared to their mortal 
contemporaries: Glasya's knowledge of the law. She
