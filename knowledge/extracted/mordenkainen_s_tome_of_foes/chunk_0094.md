rock gnome inventors jabbering at near unintelligible 
speed about their latest ideas, and the hubbub is occa-
sionally punctuated by a big bang or the abrupt collapse 
of some unstable contraption. 
To rock gnomes, life is a combination of scavenger 
hunts and periods of bold experimentation. First they 
mine materials from within the earth, and then they 
figure out what they can create or invent using those re-
sources. The discovery of a new vein of metal-whether 
tin, copper, silver, or gold-makes rock gnomes clap 
their hands with glee, but they are happiest of all when 
they find a cache of gems, particularly diamonds. 
Individual rock gnomes have different ideas about 
what sorts of inventions are the most satisfying to cre-
ate, with some favoring practicality and others more 
interested in artistic expression. In each group, there 
are those who prefer to practice the alchemical arts and 
those whose talents lean toward the creation of mechan-
ical devices. Every warren has members of each persua-
sion, and they are all bound by mutual respect for what 
they do despite their different perspectives. 
PRACTICAL MAKES PERFECT 
Rock gnomes who take a more scientific approach to 
inventing are the ones responsible for creating techno-
logical devices that make life easier. Even an invention 
as simple as a new kind of rake is celebrated, and that 
advance might later be superseded by someone who 
modifies it in a way that makes it more efficient or more 
enjoyable to use. 
These inventors are rarely reluctant to try making 
devices of exceptional power, even if one might not work 
at first the way it was intended to. The gnomes know 
that it's always possible for someone else to learn from 
an inventor's mistakes, so even a failed experiment is 
a success in some way. Every minor explosion or other 
incident of turmoil in a rock gnome burrow serves as a 
clue about what not to do next time- unless, of course, 
the goal was to make something explode. 
FOR BEAUTY'S SAKE 
Imagination runs wild in the mind of a gnome. Any fresh 
idea can be the starting point for a new journey of ex-
CELESTIAL TOYMAKERS 
A handful of master artificers exist among the rock 
gnomes who take the magic of their craft to new heights. 
These legendary gnomes usually reside in Bytopia and on 
other planes far from the Material Plane, locales where 
they can access and harness powerful energies. They have 
unlocked secrets of the multiverse that enable them to 
fashion mind-boggling creations-their so-called "celes· 
tial toys." 
These master artificers are friendly to those who seek 
them out. They enjoy showing off their works and take 
great glee in watching visitors interact with their toys, 
while they scribble notes on how to refine their creations. 
Celestial toys can do just about anything. Many of these 
objects have properties not unlike those of wondrous 
items, such as a toy that can increase an ability score or 
one that can show happenings on other planes.
