a highly subjective matter. A farmer has no use for an 
arcane spell that could incinerate a legion of warriors, 
but the promise of knowing which crops will sell best 
over the coming years might persuade him to enter into 
an infernal compact. 
To Dispater, all of reality is a contest played out under 
secret rules. If he can discover the principles that de-
fine the true nature of the cosmos, he can learn how to 
ascend to the top of the Nine Hells' hierarchy and then 
eventually the entire planar order. He covets the souls 
of those who seek secrets and those who have useful, 
secret information of their own that he can bargain for. 
MAMMON 
THE COUNT OF MY COINS IS MORE RELIABLE TH.AN ANY 
roster of mortal hearts or immortal souls. 
-Mammon 
Mammon is the foremost merchant and miser of the 
Nine Hells, and perhaps the richest entity in all the 
planes. As the lord of Minauros, Mammon oversees 
the soul trade. While those who pledge their souls are 
claimed by the devil they bargained with, lawful evil 
creatures that aren't bound by any contract emerge from 
the River Styx as lemures. Roving bands of soul-mon-
gers patrol the river's banks, harvesting the newly cre-
ated devils. On its arrival, each soul passes through the 
capital ofMinauros, the Sinking City, and is recorded. 
The soul is then distributed to whoever should claim it, 
according to contracts in force and laws in effect. Mam-
mon appropriates any extra lemures for himself and 
sells them for profit. 
Mammon has accumulated a great treasure hoard, but 
spends only a small portion of it on maintaining his do-
main. As a result, Minauros is a fetid, wretched place, its 
structures characterized by cheap construction, flimsy 
materials, and shoddy artisanship. 
EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE 
Mammon measures everything in terms of its value in 
gold. He cares only for the material gain that a trans-
action can provide for him. He never rests, and spends 
every waking moment pursuing schemes to fatten his 
treasury. He looks for every opportunity to make his 
processes more efficient, so that he can rake in more 
and more gold in a given span of time. 
Mammon's obsession with wealth and efficiency make 
him a dangerous entity to entreat. He enters any bargain 
with the goal of making a profit. Those who waste his 
time or tarry in their dealings with him are likely to 
incur his wrath. If he can't make an acceptable profit in 
CHAPTER l J THE BLOOD WAR 
return for the time he has spent, he can at least vent his 
frustration by grinding the offending party into a thick, 
bloody sludge. 
FINANCIER OF THE HELLS 
Mammon's wealth is his primary way of exerting power 
and influence. He offers monetary loans to other devils 
in return for service, favors, or items he desires. From 
time to time, he dips into his coffers to attract merce-
naries to ensure that a particularly virulent demonic 
advance is stopped-always in the expectation that the 
current lord of Avernus turns loot and booty obtained 
from the defeated demons over to him. 
When they bargain with mortals, Mammon and his 
minions can offer irresistible wealth. Devils that are 
tasked with harvesting souls for Mammon carry with 
them The Accounting and Valuation of All Things, a 
manual that guides them in assessing the value of a 
soul in gold or other goods. The amount of gold that 
is needed to incite the greed of mortals is a minuscule 
drain on Mammon's treasury, but the transactions that 
he and his followers consummate draw in more souls 
than the efforts of any other Lord of the Nine. 
A SHABBY KINGDOM 
The layer of Minauros teeters on the edge of ruin. The 
realm is a great swamp, interspersed with cities and for-
tresses that are in constant need of repair, upkeep, and 
replacement. Time and again, structures built on this 
layer are left untended and are eventually drawn into the 
bottomless muck of the swamp. 
Mammon refuses to spend any more coin than nec-
essary to keep the soul marketplace in the Sinking City 
functioning. Devils and fiends from across the planes 
gather here to trade souls. The place bustles with activ-
ity as caravans arrive and depart and merchants haggle 
over their wares. Buildings rest haphazardly atop the ru-
ins of those that have sloughed into the muck. The roads 
are little more than huge stones sunk into the swamp, 
needing constant replacement as they slowly submerge 
until the mud consumes them. 
FIERNA AND BELIAL 
A PALADIN? How EXQUISITE! SIT, PLEAS£. REST. TELL ME 
about the god that would send such a bright soul on so long 
and dark a journey. 
-Fierna 
In the flaming realm of P hlegethos, Fierna and Belia! 
rule in strange tandem. They are variously thought of 
by mortals as mother and son, daughter and father, wife 
and husband, or ruler and consort, but none of those 
terms can capture the paradoxical nature of their part-
nership. The Nine Hells is a hierarchy in which two indi-
viduals can't normally hold the same position as ruler of 
a single layer. Yet Asmodeus allows these two to claim 
dominion over Phlegethos as partners and rivals. 
Fierna's charisma, equaled only by that of Asmodeus, 
makes her a brilliant manipulator capable of filling 
mortal and immortal hearts with whatever emotion she 
chooses to evoke. Belia!, meanwhile, doesn't attempt to
