CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
ADULT KRUT H IK 
It takes six months of steady eating for a young kruthik 
to reach adult size. The natural life span of an adult 
kruthik is roughly seven years. 
Adult kruthiks grow spiky protrusions on their legs 
and can fling these dagger-sized spikes at enemies be-
yond the reach of their claws. 
KRUTHIK HIVE LORD 
A hive lord rules each kruthik hive. When the hive lord 
dies, the surviving members of the hive abandon their 
lair and search for a new one. When a suitable location 
is found, the largest kruthik in the hive undergoes a 
metamorphosis, forming a cocoon around itself and 
emerging several weeks later as a hive lord- a bigger 
and smarter kruthik with the ability to spray digestive 
acid from its maw. The hive lord claims the largest 
chamber of the lair and keeps several adult kruthiks 
nearby as bodyguards.
