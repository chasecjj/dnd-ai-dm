her followers, such as silver arrowheads, knife blades, 
and wooden shields, are often decorated with a stylized 
image of Sehanine's eye with rays coming out of it- a 
warning to the elves' enemies that Sehanine's gaze has 
fallen upon them. 
D EEP SASHELAS 
Deep Sashelas, sometimes known just as Sashelas, is 
the elven deity of the sea, seafaring, and knowledge. 
Sashelas is called the Knowledgeable One. His aware-
ness of all lore, not only that about the sea, is seemingly 
limitless. He is especially beloved by sea elves, dolphins, 
and elf sages. 
Most of Sashelas's most devoted followers are sea 
elves, as are his priests. Many seafarers toss offerings of 
gold and jewels overboard, beseeching Sashelas to calm 
storms or provide favorable winds, and he is inclined 
to aid them even if they aren't fully dedicated to his 
worship. His sea elf priests often lurk in the water be-
neath ships when these offerings are made. They catch 
the treasures as they sink and use them to decorate 
Sashelas's underwater shrines, to purchase items from 
coastal merchants that can't be manufactured underwa-
ter, and to bribe dragon turtles into their service. Cere-
monies honoring Sashelas are held underwater at times 
of uncommonly high tides or during electrical storms, 
when flashes of lightning above the waves provide illu-
mination to the calmer realm below the surface. 
S ea of Knowledge. Over time, much of the world 
sinks to the depths of the oceans and is thought to be 
lost forever, but it isn't lost to everyone. Sashelas gleans 
much about the world above the waves from that which 
sinks beneath them: every shipwreck, every offering, 
and the wealth and knowledge of every seaside city 
swallowed by a giant wave are added to Sashelas's 
ever-expanding library of lore. Knowledge that has dis-
appeared from the surface world might still be known 
to the priests of Sashelas, gained through communion 
with their god. Messengers who never reached their des-
tination, ships filled with scrolls from an ancient library, 
scholars whose works were lost at sea- all of these add 
to Sashelas's storehouse. 
Away from the open sea, many lagoons, reefs, and 
grottoes have shrines devoted to Sashelas. Many come 
in reverence to bathe in the waters in the hope of receiv-
ing visions from the god, since it is known that Sashelas 
is fond of sharing knowledge with those who are true 
seekers. Scholars, monks, and clerics visit these elabo-
rately decorated seaside temples, immersing themselves 
in the blessed waters and looking for enlightenment. 
Because the god also dispenses lore through dreams 
and reveries of memory, many artists and poets worship 
Sashelas. They seek his creative insight by spending 
time floating on the waves, then return to shore to write 
down or sketch out the gifts bequeathed to them. 
ARVAN DOR 
-----------~----
Arvandor is the ancient elven name for the home of 
the Seldarine, one of the realms on the Outer Plane of 
Arborea. It is a place where the unfettered passions of 
elves run free. joy, lust, rage, contentment, jealousy, and 
love in all their extremes are on spectacular display

there. Lifelong friends might share a laugh over food 
and wine, cross blades over a mutual lover, and write 
songs celebrating each other's courage and integrity, 
all in a single evening. Elves who live on Arvandor are 
no different from elves living anywhere else, except for 
the intensity of their passion. All manner of elves can be 
found there, including eladrin and even a few extraor-
dinary drow. The splendor of the Seldarine illuminates 
their days, and their trances are filled with the intoxi-
cating, blissful feeling engendered by their nearness to 
Corellon's magnificence. 
When an elf's soul reincarnates, the elf might return 
to life on any world or on Arvandor. As a result, many 
elves alive today have latent memories of a previous life 
spent on Arvandor. Because of the deep feelings associ-
ated with those memories, they are often among the first 
previous-life recollections to resurface at the beginning 
of an elf's Remembrance. Recalling such an existence 
can stir up a great longing to visit the place once again. 
Like most Outer Planes, Arvandor can be perilous 
for outsiders, including mortal elves who were not born 
in the place. The native elves are boisterous, tempestu-
ous, and ready to draw blood over the slightest insult or 
lapse of tradition. The plane's beauty is both overpow-
ering and bewildering. Fey spirits lurk everywhere, and 
they're even more unpredictable and more easily pro-
voked than the elves. 
Those are the obvious dangers. The subtle danger 
of Arvandor is that it can act like an addictive drug on 
visitors: the longer they remain, the more likely they 
will never want to leave. Anyone who stays more than 
a month might need to be dragged back to their home 
plane by well-meaning friends, then guarded or confined 
until Arvandor's pull on the person wanes. 
Because of all these difficulties, many elves resist the 
urge to visit Arvandor and instead make a pilgrimage to 
the Feywild, which feels like a realm very similar to the 
home of their gods. 
EVERMEET -----
UAUL'SELU'KERYTH. IN YOUR TONGUE, THE NAME MIGHT 
be translated as ''At War with the Weave." When twelve 
High Mages last performed this ritual, the world was torn 
asunder. It is a power no mortal should possess and no god 
should use. 
- Ecamane Truesilver, High Mage of Silverymoon 
At one time or another, every surface elf, during every 
lifetime, pines for Arvandor. They might not know of 
Arvandor or be able to fully define the longing, but they 
can't escape it. Getting to Arvandor, on the other hand, 
is extraordinarily difficult for most mortal elves, requir-
ing magic far beyond what most practitioners are capa-
ble of. Yet even if one could manage to open or find such 
a pathway, Corellon doesn't look favorably on elves from 
the mortal world who get near to him in this way. He suf-
fers their presence only for a short time, forcing them to 
vacate the realm or be overcome by it. 
It was, in part, this situation that led to the creation of 
Evermeet. By means of a cataclysmic ritual, the greatest
