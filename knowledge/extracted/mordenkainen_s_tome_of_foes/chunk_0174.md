NAG PA 
Long ago, the Raven Queen cursed a cabal of thirteen 
powerful wizards for meddling in a ritual that would 
have helped avert a war between the gods. She stripped 
them of their beauty, turning them into scabrous, bird-
like monstrosities. The nagpas now plot as they ever did, 
but they now strive to bring about terrible, world-shak-
ing calamities so they can pry secrets and power from 
the wreckage their conspiracies create. 
The nagpas fear the Raven Queen and do their best to 
avoid her and her agents. When it's impossible to do so. 
they become cringing, fawning things , eager to please 
and thereby escape the cold gaze of the being who 
brought them so low. All of the original thirteen remain 
alive, thanks to their cunning and their willingness to do 
whatever is necessary to survive. 
Looters of Civilization. The curse the Raven Queen 
placed on the nagpas restricts the ways in which they 
can acquire new lore and magical power, barring them 
from any source except for the ruins left behind from 
fallen civilizations and great calamities . For this reason, 
nagpas turn their efforts to bringing about such ends, so 
they can loot the libraries, plunder the vaults, and gather 
up secrets of arcane lore from the wreckage. 
Puppet Masters. Nagpas work in the shadows, ma-
nipulating events to bring about ruin. As accomplished 
magic-users, they can bring to bear an array of spells 
to make agents of other creatures, influencing their 
decisions in subtle ways and pulling on strings to make 
them into unwitting accomplices in their own destruc-
tion. Nagpas show great patience in their plots and have 
several schemes working simultaneously, each at differ-
ent stages of completion, so if one plan goes awry, they 
can shift their focus to another. Typically, nagpas only 
show their handiwork and emerge from the shadows 
when they can deliver a finishing blow and then revel in 
the grand devastation their plotting brought about.
