An elf who begins to experience these other-life mem-
ories might live on as normal for decades, but as the 
intrusions become more frequent, they take their toll 
on the individual's outlook. Eventually, an elrs thoughts 
start drifting away from worldly accomplishments and 
turning more and more inward. This change is gradual 
at first, but it becomes more and more severe until it 
can't be ignored. When that happens, an elf loses inter-
est in the outside world and wants nothing more than 
to return home, to be surrounded by others of their own 
kind, to explore the memories they've accumulated in 
this life and keep them separate from the ever-increas-
ing number of other-life memories that are resurfacing. 
Most elves undergo this experience in their third or 
fourth century. Elves who led extremely active and dan-
gerous lives, such as adventurers, seem to be affected 
earlier than those who pursue more sedate occupations. 
Notably, elves who have been revived from death by 
magical means seem to experience their first other-life 
memory earlier than they otherwise might. 
Regardless of how soon or how often elves experience 
such memories, most consider them a blessing from the 
gods. The experiences of other lives that are revisited 
during trance can be examined for lessons to be applied 
during one's waking life, signs from the gods, or ways to 
open an elf's perspective to other points of view. 
A handful of elves in any generation never experience 
an other-life memory during trance. It's hypothesized 
that these select few might be reincarnations of the orig-
inal primal elves who sprang from Corellon's blood and 
were allowed to stay in his company. Although most el-
der elves become more serene, these rare folk spend the 
rest of their lives throwing themselves into dangerous 
situations, as if daring death to try to take them. 
AGING AND D EATH 
Most elves don't age outwardly as other humanoids do. 
The skin of adults remains smooth, their hair docs not 
gray, and their bones do not ache. Even the oldest elves 
look similar in age to a human of perhaps 30 years. 
Yet there is one sure sign that an elf is nearing the end 
of life: cataracts in the shape of crescents, points down, 
that appear over the pupils of both eyes when the elf is 
in trance. This change, commonly known as Transcen-
dence, is evidence that Sehanine Moonbow has opened 
the door to enable the elf's soul to return to Arvandor- a 
direct sign from the gods that it's time to get one's af-
fairs in order. 
How much time an elf's body has left is never certain. 
Whether hours or years, the period is marked by both 
intense joy and great sadness. Most mortal elves accept 
their upcoming fate with optimism or resignation, but 
some react by throwing themselves back into the labors 
of life with a frenzy other elves consider unbecoming. 
Elves who die of old age without experiencing Tran-
scendence are believed to have been denied admission 
to Arvandor, and thus their souls pass on to other planes 
and are never reincarnated. The living are left to guess 
why this might be true, but an elf's conduct during life 
often offers a clue. Drow never experience Transcen-
dence, for example, and the same is true for elves who 
turn to the worship of gods other than the Seldarine. 
THE ELVEN OUTLOOK 
The elves of the surface realms have a unique per-
spective on the workings of the world and their place 
in it that is a mixture of all the factors that shape their 
nature, dating back to the rift between the primal elves 
and Corellon in the time before time. 
CULTURA L MELANCH O LY 
The reason that elves are seldom frivolous and carefree 
is rooted in an inborn malaise or sorrow that infused 
the primal elves when they chose to stop following 
Corellon's path. These feelings of regret and sadness 
grip all elves at various times in their lives and impact 
every aspect of their society. 
Priests among the elves typically believe that the 
broken link can never be healed unless Corellon has a 
change of heart. And as changeable as Corellon is, the 
god has been adamant on one point: as long as Lolth 
remains in existence, the responsibility for her betrayal 
falls on all elves. When the primal elves cast aside form-
lessness and impermanence for the promise of great· 
ness, they forsook the part of their nature that Corellon 
most cherished- and, worse still, by doing so they some-
how compromised Corellon's mutability as well. 
Whether or not Lolth tricked the primal elves, to 
Corellon's mind, is beside the point. They chose to fol-
low her lead, which precipitated the schism between 
Corellon and Lolth, even if many of them ultimately 
remained loyal to Corellon. Now the elves of the world 
must forever live and die and live again. suffering the 
consequences of their ancestors' poor judgment. In this
