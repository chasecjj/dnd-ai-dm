KOBOLDS: ENEMIES FOREVER 
Kobolds and gnomes have been foes for as long as either 
group can remember, all because of a brilliant prank that 
Gari Glittergold played on Kurtulmak, the kobold deity. 
In a long-ago age, as one version of the story goes, the 
kobolds were used as slaves by evil dragons, much as 
they are today-forced to scrub the scales of their mas-
ters, clean their lairs, and stack the gold in their treasure 
hoards. One kobold, Kurtulmak, was arguably the craftiest 
of all kobolds. He sought other creatures to do the work 
in the kobolds' stead, and found a suitable victim in the 
gnomes. Because they were less aggressive than their 
tormentors, the gnomes fell under the sway of Kurtulmak's 
horde of kobolds. 
But Gari Glittergold proved to be a thorn in Kurtulmak's 
scaly side. The merry prankster irritated, bamboozled, 
confounded, and exasperated the kobold god while freeing 
large groups of gnomes from his clutches. When Kurtul-
mak's patience wore out after several of these embarrass-
ments, he declared an oath to bring death to all gnomes. 
To keep his nemesis from doing him harm, Gari tricked 
Kurtulmak into chasing him into a maze of caves by sing-
ing mocking songs and cavorting in a way that he knew 
especially infuriated Kurtulmak. Once the kobold god was 
deep in the maze, with a glittering wink and a snap of 
his fingers, Gari collapsed the system of caverns on Kur-
tulmak, trapping him deep underground for all time. To 
this day, kobolds seek out gnomes for retribution at every 
opportunity. 
GARL G LITTERGOLD 
When gnome children hear their first stories about the 
gods, they are introduced to a gold-skinned gnome with 
a wide grin and glittering gemstone eyes that shift col-
ors like a kaleidoscope. The youngsters quickly learn 
to recognize that their favorite character, the god of the 
gnomes, is about to steal the show. 
A joker and a prankster, Gari Glittergold reminds 
gnomes that life is to be taken lightly, and that a good 
laugh will serve them better than a grim attitude. When 
Gari cavorts with mischief on his mind, Moradin's 
beard might end up woven with giggling flowers, and 
Gruumsh's axe could sprout braying donkey heads at 
the most inopportune time. 
Cooperation Is Key. The legends about Gari Glitter-
gold inspire gnomes to work together. Gari knows that 
many heads and many hands make light work. Although 
he also plays many pranks on his own, Gari is the one 
who gathers the heroes together for an enterprise that 
requires all their talents. To provide specific guidance, 
Gari might send an omen to nudge a group of gnomes 
in a certain direction, or even manifest an avatar in the 
middle of a gnome burrow. When Gari makes one of 
these rare appearances, it is to resolve a dispute that 
threatens a community. 
Brains over Brawn. Gari favors trickery and illusion 
over direct combat, preferring to use his mind to over-
come a problem rather than his steel. For gnomes to 
thrive, they must use their intellect and ingenuity. But 
when push comes to shove, Gari uses Arumdina, his 
intelligent two-headed battle axe- capable of cleaving 
through any substance- to escape a perilous situation. 
BAERVAN WILDWANDERER 
Baervan Wildwanderer is the god of the forests and of 
those who travel, a peaceful soul whose explorations 
often turn into exciting adventures. Baervan's constant 
companion is Chiktikka Fastpaws, a mischievous giant 
raccoon who often gets the duo into trouble. Although 
Baervan isn't as much of a prankster as some of the 
other gods, she is often held responsible when Chiktikka 
does something outrageous, such as stealing Gruumsh's 
breakfast or peeing on Rillifane Rallathil's shoes. 
Baervan can sing every bird's song, knows every type 
of plant that has ever grown, never gets lost, and can 
befriend anyone under the sun (as long as Chiktikka 
chooses to act pleasant rather than annoying). Forest 
gnomes believe that they can speak to the animals of the 
woods and on the wing because Baervan teaches their 
souls how to do so before they are born. 
B ARAVAR CLOAKSHADOW 
When gnomes arrived in the world, Baravar protected 
them by teaching them how to hide, use magic, and de-
ceive their foes. She was once entrapped by the goblin 
god Khurgorbaeyag, and after escaping and gaining her 
revenge, she began the practice of never wearing the 
same face twice, and she follows a different routine ev-
ery day so no one can predict what she might do. When 
gnomes tell stories of their gods' adventures, Bara var is 
always the last to be found when the group forms, but 
she nevertheless swiftly agrees to support Garl's plans. 
Forest gnomes and deep gnomes owe their innate 
magical abilities to Baravar, and all gnomes get their 
natural defense against magic from her shrewdness. 
CALLARDURAN SMOOTHHANDS 
Callarduran became the patron of the deep gnomes 
when he led them into the Underdark and taught them 
how to survive, but all gnomes see him as the embodi-
ment of the drive to know more, to examine everything 
more minutely- and thereby make great discoveries. 
Callarduran earned his moniker when, after stealing 
the heart of Ogremoch, he rubbed his hands smooth 
as he polished the heart and turned it into a magical 
stone. The theft caused Ogremoch to turn to evil, but 
it gave Callarduran the power to control earth elemen-
tals- which, it is said, he can confer to deep gnomes by 
rubbing the stone and saying their names. 
fLANDAL STEELSKIN 
The stories that gnomes tell of Flandal Steelskin typ-
ically feature some perfect item that he crafted or a 
misadventure that results from following his enormous 
nose, which can smell ore more easily than a wolf can 
scent a skunk. The most often told legend of Flandal in-
cludes both elements. Before creating Garl's marvelous 
axe, Arumdina, Flandal sniffed out the purest source 
of mithral: the heart of lmix. With the aid of the other 
gnome gods, he stole the heart and turned it into a mi-
thral forge that now burns with an eternal furious flame. 
The legends of Flandal portray him not only as the 
god of metalcraft, but also of fire and glass-work and 
alchemy. Rock gnomes attribute their knack for crafting 
devices and alchemical objects to Flandal's superlative 
skills in those areas.
