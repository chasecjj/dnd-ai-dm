HIDDEN BUT HOMEY 
Deep gnomes protect their enclaves with labyrinthine 
tunnels, traps, and armed guards, all designed to make 
the entrance to a settlement uninviting. But inside its 
borders, a deep gnome settlement is a warren shaped 
and decorated by the svirfneblin to make the place wel-
coming and comfortable. 
Although they are skilled stonemasons, svirfneblin ap-
preciate the beauty of natural stone and prefer either to 
carve to accentuate its features or to leave it unchanged. 
Their architecture is marked by smooth, curving shapes 
rather than straight lines and hard edges. 
Svirfneblin are intensely community-minded and have 
little concern about privacy among themselves. Thus, 
they don't close off living spaces with doors or window 
coverings. Most of their homes are sparsely furnished 
dwellings of one or two rooms. Bed spaces, often carved 
into the cavern walls, are strung with hammocks for 
each inhabitant, but often are otherwise empty except 
for stone coffers holding a few personal effects. 
GNOME GODS 
WHO FORGED THE CHAINS THAT BIND TIAMAT IN 
Avernus? Why do the modrons go on the Great March? 
Who is the Lady of Pain, real()!? I can't tellyou. but the an-
swers lie in the Colden Hills. And if Carl and his gang don't 
know, it can't be known. 
- Griballix, gnome of Sigil 
It shouldn't be surprising that gnomes, inveterate inven-
tors that they are, have· an incredible number of legends 
they tell about their deities. Every warren has its unique 
repertoire of tales-some of them no doubt grounded 
in fact, while others could be the products of imagina-
tion. The distinction isn't important to the folk who take 
inspiration and pride from the stories of their gods, be-
cause each legend is true in its own way.

CHAPTER 5 I HALFLINGS AND GNO~ES 
Each deity in the gnome pantheon is an expert in 
multiple fields of activity who is capable of incredible • 
feats. Yet these heroes also display shortcomings, such 
as hesitance or selfishness. Only the chief gnome deity, 
Gari Glittergold, can convince the others to set aside 
personal concerns to embark on a grand excursion or to 
work together toward a common goal. And according to 
the gnomes, it is proven that their gods can accomplish 
the impossible when they band together. 
Perhaps because of each community's particular out-
look or because the gods frequently use illusory guises, 
several diverse ideas exist about the membership of the 
pantheon. In some communities, the gods are thought 
to be all male or all female; in some they are animals, or 
constructs made by Gari Glittergold. Some gnomes say 
Gari has five allies, while others tally eleven. 
A consensus of sorts emerges from the totality of 
these beliefs. Most gnomes believe that Gari Glittergold 
and his seven able assistants dwell on, in, or under 
seven summits known as the Golden Hills. This is the 
place from where new gnomish souls are sent out to 
experience the wider world, and to which they return to 
join the hallowed community of those who have come 
before them. Urdlen is the only gnome deity that doesn't 
dwell there, having been exiled by Gari for its refusal to 
cooperate with the rest of the group. 
The Gnome Deities table lists the members of the 
gnome pantheon. For each god, the table notes align-
ment, province (the god's main areas of interest and 
responsibility), suggested domains for clerics who serve 
the god, and a common symbol of the god. Several of the 
gods in the table are described below.
