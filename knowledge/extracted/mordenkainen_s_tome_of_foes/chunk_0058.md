continue to depend on the same plan for defending its 
stronghold that has been used for centuries, without 
considering the possibility that its enemies have discov-
ered how to overcome those defenses. 
The dwarves' way of thinking leads to difficulties in 
their relationships with humans and elves. From their 
long-lived perspective, dwarves can't understand the 
speed with which human communities and civiliza-
tions rise and fall. If a trade delegation from a dwarven 
stronghold were to visit a human town once every 
twenty or thirty years- not a long time to a dwarf- the 
community's leaders would likely be different every 
time, and for the dwarves the experience would be akin 
to making first contact all over again. Establishing trade 
with this "new" human outpost would require forming 
new relationships, a process that could take weeks 
or months. 
The elves' chaotic nature and love of the wilderness 
baffle the dwarves, who think of them as somewhat 
mad. Dwarves typically find elves too flighty to ever 
fully trust them, believing that creatures that thrive on 
change and chaos can't possibly be reliable allies. 
In particular situations, of course, the benefits of 
cooperating with humans or elves can override the 
dwarves' concern about the shortcomings of those 
races. When dwarves, humans, and elves have a com-
mon enemy, they all find a way to work together for the 
common good.

The clan is the basic unit of dwarven society, an ex-
tended family that dwells together. Everything a dwarf 
does in life is devoted to improving or helping the clan, 
bringing security and stability to its members and 
greater glory to the group. 
The most important clan members to any dwarf are 
the members of one's immediate family, because the 
instinctive connection between parent and child is 
stronger than the attachment between unrelated clan 
members. Nevertheless, the distinction is so slim as to 
be unnoticeable to outsiders- dwarves will endure hard-
ship or lay down their lives for any of their clan mates, 
whether related to them by blood or by the devotion that 
holds the clan together. 
TuE GREATEST LEGACY 
The life of a dwarf is all about doing good work and 
leaving behind a fitting legacy that continues to bolster 
the clan even after its creator has passed on-a legacy 
counted not only in objects, but also in dwarven souls. 
Dwarves who become parents rightfully think of their 
children as the greatest legacy they can leave the clan, 
and they raise them with the same care and attention to 
detail that they give to the items they create. A dwarf's

direct descendants- beloved sons, daughters, and 
grandchildren-are often the ones who inherit the inani-
mate works their ancestor leaves behind. 
Marriage is a sacred rite among the dwarves, taken 
very seriously because it requires two children to move 
away from their homes to start a new family in the clan. 
The affected families feel a sense of loss that is healed 
only when a new dwarf child enters the world- an event 
that calls for great celebration. 
Few dwarves develop romantic feelings for their 
spouses, at least not in the way that other races do. They 
view their spouses as collaborators and co-creators, 
their elders as respected experts to be obeyed, and their 
children as their most treasured creations. The emotion 
that underlies all those feelings might not be love, as 
others would term it, but it is just as intense. 
ROLES IN THE CLAN 
Every clan calls upon its members to fill three principal 
roles, each of which contributes to the group's welfare. 
First, many dwarves support the clan by working at an 
occupation that sustains the community-brewing ale, 
tending crops, and preparing food, for instance. Not ev-
eryone can be a master artisan or a vigilant warrior; the 
clan needs a wide range of labor and talents to meet all 
the needs of the group. 
Filling the second role are an equally large number 
of dwarves whose occupations involve the crafting of 
items and other forms of creation- smelting, smithing, 
gem-cutting, sculpture, and similar tasks. These arti-
sans are responsible for making the items that help the 
clan protect its stronghold. 
The third function is performed by those who navigate 
the space between the clan and the chaotic creatures of 
the outside world. These dwarves are merchants, war-
riors, and envoys, tasked with representing the dwarves 
in dealings with other races and with providing a buffer 
between the clan and the potential threats of creatures 
and communities in the vicinity of the stronghold. 
A dwarf assigned to a role takes years to master it. A 
weaponsmith starts work in the forge, providing manual 
labor to haul ore from the mines and learning how to 
repair tools. The dwarf might then work in the mines, 
pushing carts and learning to pick out the best ore sam-
ples from a lode. Slowly but surely, a dwarf masters ev-
ery aspect of a task or an occupation from start to finish. 
LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNMENT 
A clan is led by a king or a queen who sits at the head of 
a noble family. Dwarf nobles are members of families 
that claim direct ancestry to the first dwarves crafted by 
Moradin. To the dwarves, leadership is a craft like any 
other activity, calling for careful practice and constant
