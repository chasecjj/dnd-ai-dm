FRAZ- URB'LUU 
The most deceptive of all demons, Fraz-Urb'luu is a mas-
ter illusionist and weaver of lies. He thrives by luring his 
cultists and his enemies alike into lives of self-delusion. 
He can take on nearly any form, usually appearing in 
whatever shape is most pleasing to a potential cultist. 
Fraz-Urb'luu considers himself the smartest entity 
in the cosmos, the only one who can see through all of 
reality's lies and understand the truth that lies beyond 
them. Yet the truth that he sees remains known only to 
him. He utters cryptic remarks about a grand design 
that guides the cosmos toward some unknown end, 
but none can say whether these statements are another 
layer of deception or evidence of a true insight. 
Cultists. Those who worship Fraz-Urb'luu fall into 
two camps. Most of his so-called "cultists," rather than 
being true volunteers, are unfortunates duped into hon-
oring him because they listened to his lies. Fraz-Urb'luu 
might appear to a desperate paladin and claim to be a 
saintly figure, or contact a wizard while in the guise of 
a wise sage. He tells these folk whatever stories and 
promises they want to hear, playing to their needs and 
slowly drawing them into his circle of influence. He es-
pecially enjoys using the arrogance and vanity of good 
folk against them, helping to bring about their downfall. 
A few of his followers are illusionists, deceivers, and 
con artists who seek him out. Fraz-Urb'luu makes use 
of their talents, and rewards these supplicants appropri-
ately, as long as they follow his example in the campaign 
to bring about the downfall of all that is lawful and good. 
CHAPTER I I THE BLOOD WAR 
GRAZ
1ZT 
The lord of pleasure and limitless indulgence, Graz'zt is 
the ultimate hedonist. He incites lust and uncontrollable 
urges in both his cultists and his enemies. 
In Graz'zt's eyes, the universe is a great plaything, and 
one day he will be its master. All other creatures and 
things will be allowed to exist only if they give him plea-
sure. When he ascends to dominate the cosmos, all who 
are left will love and worship him. 
Despite his extreme self-indulgence, Graz'zt isn't blind 
to what goes on around him. He can curb his lust when 
he needs to plot against an enemy or counter an attack. 
When he must contend with an enemy, he fights with a 
GRAZ'ZT'S MURKY PAST 
Sages have put forth ideas for why demons consider the 
denizens of the Nine Hells as the greatest threat to their 
designs for the cosmos. Some researchers claim to have 
uncovered evidence that the animosity between demons 
and devils has its roots in a primeval time when Graz'zt, 
now a demon lord, was a member of the devils' hierarchy. 
As the hypothesis goes, Graz'zt wasn't satisfied with the 
prospect of being eternally subservient to Asmodeus in the 
Hells, where only one devil can claim absolute rulership. 
The Abyss offers greater freedom to those who are pow· 
erful enough to carve out a realm for themselves-and, 
after forsaking his status in the Hells, that's exactly what 
Graz'zt did. 
Those who find this idea plausible hope that Graz'zt's 
defection is a unique event, never to be repeated. If that 
turns out not to be the case, another such shift could be a 
major turning point in the Blood War.
