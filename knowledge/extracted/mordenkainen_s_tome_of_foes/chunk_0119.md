SIBRIEX 
Thought to be as old as the Abyss itself, sibriexes haunt 
remote parts of the plane, where they use their vile abili-
ties to breed new horrors and apprehend forbidden lore. 
Rivulets of blood and bile cascade from a sibriex's body. 
Where these noxious fluids hit the ground, the land-
scape becomes polluted.

Contamination. The sibriex emits an aura of corruption 30 feet 
in every direction. Plants that aren't creatures wither in the 
aura, and the ground in it is difficult terrain for other creatures. 
Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a 
DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison dam-
age. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this 
sibriex's Contamination for 24 hours. 
Innate Spellcasting. The sibriex's innate spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 21). It can innately cast the following 
spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: charm person, command, dispel magic, hold monster 
3/day: feeblemind 
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the sibriex fails a saving throw, 
it can choose to succeed instead. 
Magic Resistance. The sibriex has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack.l he sibriex uses Squirt Bile once and makes three 
attacks using its chain, bite, or both. 
Chain. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. 
Hit: 20 (2d12 + 7) piercing damage. 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach S ft., one target. 
Hit: 9 (2d8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage. 
Squirt Bile. The sibriex targets one creature it can see within 
120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity 
saving throw or take 35 (10d6) acid damage. 
Warp Creature. The sibriex targets up to three creatures it 
can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 
Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature 
becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed 
save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 
level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target 
must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. 
Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending 
the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. 
Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of 
exhaustion. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it 
dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch under 
the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be 
undone only by a wish spell. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The sibriex can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the op-
tions below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a 
time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sibriex 
regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. 
Cast a Spell. The sibriex casts a spell. 
Spray Bile. The sibriex uses Squirt Bile. 
Warp (Costs 2 Actions). The sibriex uses Warp Creature.
