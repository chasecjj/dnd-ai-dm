marauding humanoid or greedy monster lusts after the 
riches that dwarves keep in their strongholds. The big-
gest threats to their security are dragons and giants, but 
other humanoids such as ores and the hated duergar are 
their most numerous foes. 
DRAGONS 
Chromatic dragons, by their nature, are often attracted 
to the treasures that dwarves gather in their fortresses. 
Although such a place might be too stout for a dragon to 
assault and take over, an evil dragon that makes its lair 
near a dwarven stronghold can be a threat to the occu-
pants in many ways. 
Black Dragons. Since black dragons prefer to 
dwell in swampland, one rarely makes a lair close to 
a stronghold. When a black dragon does cross paths 
with dwarves, it might attempt to isolate a settlement by 
making the roads leading to it impassable. The terrain 
around the dragon's lair is transformed into a riot of 
vegetation and patches of mud, slowing travelers and 
making caravans vulnerable to attack by the dragon's 
followers. When a stronghold becomes cut off, the 
dragon might start to test its outer defenses in advance 
of mounting a larger assault. This strategy can take 
years to come to fruition, but from the dragon's perspec-
tive it is time well spent. 
Blue Dragons. Blue dragons are the least likely of 
their kind to tangle with dwarves, since their lairs are 
always far from where dwarves typically settle, and a 
blue dragon almost never gives away the location of its 
lair. One might appear before a band of dwarves travel-
ing through the area and demand a toll for safe passage 
through its territory, expecting payment in the form of 
gems- and particularly sapphires. 
Green Dragons. Dwarves and green dragons don't 
often interact, and when they do, the dragon doesn't 
usually threaten them directly. A typical green dragon 
has no burning desire to possess the material goods in 
a stronghold's hoard, and would much rather snatch up 
living treasure. Using its powers of deception, a green 
dragon might try to entice dwarves it encounters to 
ally with it in return for the promise of great wealth. 
Dwarves who have been touched by Abbathor might 
succumb to this temptation- only to find themselves im-
D WARV ES AND A LE 
Dwarves have a reputation for being able to consume great 
quantities of ale. Although drinking plays a significant role 
in their culture, it is a mistake to assume that intoxication 
has the same effect on them as it does on humans. 
Humans drink to forget, while dwarves drink to remem-
ber. A dwarf deep in his cups is overcome by powerful, 
vivid memories of his past, especially events tied to lost 
kin, great deeds, or monumental failures. 
When dwarves drink in a group, this effect spreads 
among them. The clan might joyfully sing of triumph as 
they reminisce over the defeat of a dragon, or weep as they 
recall the death of a beloved elder. 
In contrast to clan gatherings, dwarves who drink alone 
invariably become morose and sullen-when separated 
from their clan mates, they can't avoid dwelling on un-
pleasant memories. It's the wise traveler who leaves alone 
the sole, drunken dwarf in the corner. 
prisoned in the dragon's lair, sentenced to a lifetime of 
crafting new items for the dragon's treasure collection. 
Red Dragons. Even though dwarves and red dragons 
compete for the same terrain, they don't come into con-
flict as often as they once did. Nowadays, red dragon 
lairs and dwarven strongholds are far enough apart that 
the dwarves don't have to worry constantly about being 
attacked. But occasionally, a young red dragon sets out 
to establish its own legacy- and what better place for a 
lair than one that comes with its own treasure hoard? 
To begin its campaign, the dragon sends out followers 
and minions to lay siege to the stronghold. If this effort 
succeeds and the defenders withdraw deeper inside. the 
dragon comes forth to lead the assault into the tunnels. 
Jn those cramped quarters, only a few dwarves at a time 
can be brought to bear against the dragon's teeth, claws, 
and fiery breath. But the dwarves know that if they allow 
the dragon access to the fortress's innermost chambers, 
the fight is all but over. 
White Dragons. Dwarves who live in cold climates 
don't usually have to cope with as many predators and 
marauders as do their kin in more hospitable terrain. 
But a white dragon patrols its territory relentlessly, nei-
ther subtle nor shrewd in its methods, often using nat-
ural camouflage to ambush its prey. A dragon that lairs 
nearby might be willing to leave a dwarven settlement 
unmolested if its appetite is sated by creatures it can 
catch in the open, including the travelers that enter and 
exit the place. 
On occasion, this state of (relatively) peaceful coex-
istence is shattered when a devious rival dragon with 
designs on a white dragon's territory enters the picture. 
Taking advantage of the dragon's limited mental facul-
ties, the rival secretly sends its minions out to harass 
the dragon. Convinced that the dwarves must be to 
blame, the dragon engages them in a wider conflict, 
and the dwarves respond in kind. Even if neither side 
destroys the other, both will be severely weakened, after 
which the rival moves in to finish the job. 
GIANTS 
Giants have no special enmity toward dwarves, but they 
do consider them ideal slaves. Even when captured 
and put to work against their will, dwarves are innately 
driven to bring their full effort to a task at hand. Even 
simple toil brings dwarves some relief from captivity. 
Fire giants are more likely than other giants to enslave 
dwarves expressly for their talents. Many tribes of hill 
giants have discovered the value of dwarves as workers 
and now seek to capture them rather than devour them.
