ing ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell 
attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no

(self only)

ACTIONS

CHAPTER 6 I BESTI ARY 
Silver Creatsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +1 2 to hit, reach 5 
ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 17 (Sd6) 
psychic damage. On a critical hit against a target in an astral 
body (as with the astral projection spell), the githyanki can cut 
the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, in-
stead of dealing damage. 
REACTIONS 
Parry. The githyanki adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack 
that would hit it. To do so, the githyanki must see the attacker 
and be wielding a melee weapon. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The githyanki can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from 
the options below. Only one legendary action option can be 
used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. 
The githyanki regains spent legendary actions at the start 
of its turn. 
Attack (2 Actions). The githyanki makes a greatsword attack. 
Command Ally. The githyanki targets one ally it can see within 
30 feet of it. If the target can see or hear the githyanki, the 
target can make one melee weapon attack using its reaction 
and has advantage on the attack roll. 
Teleport. The githyanki magically teleports, along with any 
equipment it is wearing and carrying, to an unoccupied space 
it can see within 30 feet ofit. It also becomes insubstantial 
until the start of its next turn. While insubstantial, it can 
move through other creatures and objects as if they were 
difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 16 
(3dl0) force damage and is moved to the nearest unoccu-
pied space.

GITHYANKI SUPREME COMMANDER 
Supreme commanders lead the githyanki armies, each 
one commanding ten kith'raks, who in turn lead the 
rest of their forces. Most supreme commanders ride red 
dragons into battle. 
GrTHZERAI ANARCH 
The most powerful of the githzerai, anarchs lead com-
munities and maintain the adamantine citadels that 
serve as strong points in planes beyond Limbo. They 
have formidable psionic capabilities, able to manipulate 
the unformed substance of their adopted plane with a 
thought. These rare githzerai are sages and mystics, 
and their word is law. 
AN ANARCH's LAIR 
In Limbo, githzerai anarchs create islands of tranquil-
ity in the otherwise turbulent plane. By directing its 
psionic power, an anarch can give form to formless 
substance, creating mountains, lakes, and structures of 
any composition to serve as a foundation for a githzerai 
community. 
Lair Actions. An anarch can use lair actions. On 
initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the anarch 
can take a lair action to cause one of the following 
effects; the anarch can't use the same effect two 
rounds in a row: 
• The anarch casts the lightning bolt spell (at 5th level), 
but the anarch can change the damage type from 
lightning to cold, fire, psychic, radiant, or thunder. If 
the spell deals damage other than fire or lightning, it 
doesn't ignite flammable objects. 
• The anarch casts the creation spell (as a 9th-level 
spell) using the unformed substance of Limbo in-
stead of shadow material. If used in Limbo, the object 
remains until the anarch's concentration is broken, 
regardless of its composition. If the anarch moves 
more than 120 feet from the object, its concentra-
tion breaks. 
• The anarch can magically move an object it can see 
within 150 feet of it by making a Wisdom check with 
advantage. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 
for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 
for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. 
Regional Effects. The region containing an anarch's 
lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or 
more of the following effects: 
• In Limbo, the anarch can spend 10 minutes stabilizing 
a 5-mile area centered on it, causing the unformed 
substance to take whatever inanimate form the anarch 
chooses. During that process, the anarch determines 
the shape and composition of the forms created. 
• The anarch stabilizes any object created in Limbo and 
brought to the Material Plane for as long as the anarch 
remains within 1 mile of it (no action required). 
If the anarch dies, these effects end after ld6 rounds. All 
formed substance becomes a chaotic churn of energy 
and matter, unraveling into unformed substance that 
dissipates ld6 rounds later.
