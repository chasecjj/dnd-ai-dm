ONLY THE BEST SURVIVE 
The githyanki raise their young in hidden creches that 
they construct in far-Rung places on the Material Plane. 
Such measures are necessary because birth and growth 
are impossible on the Astral Plane, whose occupants 
don't age. The adult overseers in these places train 
young githyanki to harness their psychic and physical 
abilities. 
Githyanki hatch from eggs. Each newborn enters the 
world alongside other eggs deliberately laid so that all 
hatch at the same time. Since githyanki adults must re-
turn to the Astral Plane to keep from aging significantly, 
the roster of instructors continually changes, with no 
adult staying longer than a few months and none ever 
returning for a second stint. 
The instruction that young githyanki undergo is unre-
lenting and unforgiving. As a crop of youngsters grows 
older, more and more is demanded from each student, 
and the penalties for failing to keep up become more 
and more severe. In the early stages, combat practice 
lasts only until a wound is scored. Later, near the end of 
training, a drill of the same sort might be a fight to the 
death- the ultimate way of weeding out all those who 
don't meet Vlaakith's standards. To the githyanki, it's 
better for a weakling to die in training than to undertake 
a mission and imperil a war band. 
FINAL TEST OF LOYALTY 
By the time a group of githyanki come of age, they have 
heard years of stories ofVlaakith and her immortal 
warriors dwelling in the silvery void. The young are 
told they are on the verge of entering the queen's realm, 
each one of them destined to take a special place in the 
society. Their skills have proven them worthy, and now 
only their loyalty to the Revered Queen remains to be 
determined. 
As their last test, a group of githyanki entering 
adulthood must slay a mind Rayer as a sacred rite of 
passage before they are permitted to join their people 
on the Astral Plane. When the victors enter Tu'narath 
for the first time, they carry the bounty of their hunt 
directly to Vlaakith. She accepts the gift and intones a 
ritual chant that marks the youngsters' induction into 
githyanki society. 
VLAAKITH'S DILEMMA 
Long gone are the days when the gith race was fully em-
broiled in conflict. When the githyanki settled Tu'narath 
and took up residence in the Astral Plane, they no 
longer had to fight constantly for survival, and in that 
respect the lives of all githyanki became easier. 
The mission laid out by Vlaakith in her grand procla-
mation remains of utmost impor tance. Her rule remains 
absolute, in part because she suffers no competition or 
divergent viewpoints. And her regime is in no danger, 
yet to an outsider in Tu'narath it might seem as though 
the place is in decline. 
Indeed, in a way the githyanki are victims of their 
own success. After centuries of staging lucrative raids 
throughout the multiverse, the folk ofTu'narath have 
become spoiled and decadent. Vlaakith can still sum-
mon her people to action, and when she does so they
