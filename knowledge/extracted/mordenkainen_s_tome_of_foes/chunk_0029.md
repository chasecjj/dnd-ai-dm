the People may learn all that has passed for them and their 
predecessors. Now, in songs that were once only sung in cel-
ebration, I may teach you brief candles of humanity of the 
People and your own place among us. 
-Cymbiir Haevault, Lorekeeper of House Haevault 
A memory is a curious thing. One can come into con-
sciousness unbidden, evoked by an unexpected scent 
or the words spoken by a friend. A memory can also be 
elusive, foiling all attempts to recall it and sometimes 
remembered only after the hunt is abandoned, like a 
word on the tip of one's tongue. Some memories pull at 
the heart, weighing it down and holding it there as an 
anchor moors a ship. Others buoy it up or make it flutter 
joyously like the wings of a bird. Some memories lie in 
wait like predators, ready to leap out when the mind or 
the heart is vulnerable. Some linger like scars, not al-
ways visible but ever-present. 
Perhaps more so than any other race, elves are famil-
iar with all aspects of memory. From birth, elves don't 
sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to rest. 
In this state, elves remain aware of their surroundings 
while immersing themselves in memories. What an elf 
remembers during this reverie depends largely on how 
long the elf has lived, and the events of the lives that the 
elf's soul has experienced before. 
CHILDHOOD 
Much has been made of the relative fecundity of humans 
compared to elves. Ignorant folk wonder how elves can 
live so long, yet have so few children. They cannot know 
what it means to an elf to usher a child into the world. 
They cannot understand how a birth is both a joy and a 
sorrow, a reunion and a parting. 
Each birth represents an elf soul that has been to Ar-
vandor and returned. Mortal elves cannot know if it is 
the soul of someone recently dead or someone who died 
millennia ago. They cannot even be certain it is an elf 
of the same world. The only assurance they have is that 
it is an elf of their own kind, for when the primal elves 
went against Corellon and took permanent shapes, they 
chose this fate for themselves. 
How many elves are born to which parents or in any 
given generation is a topic studied by elves in the hope 
of discerning some sign from Corellon or others of the 
Seldarine. Aerdrie Faenya, the winged goddess of air 
and sky, is thought to ferry souls from Arvandor into the 
world, bringing them down from the heavens to begin 
their mortal lives anew. A decade in which many elves 
are born across the world is thought to be a harbinger 
of danger that great numbers of elves will be needed 
to withstand. In contrast, if an elven community goes 
a century or longer without a new birth, members take 
this as a sign that the community has stagnated and 
must disband. 
Because of the rarity of elf births, siblings might be 
separated in age by decades, or even a century or more. 
Thus, few elves grow up playing with brothers or sisters 
of similar age and instead rely on friends for the devel-
opment of their social skills. In exceedingly rare cases, 
a birth might produce twins or- scarcer yet- triplets. 
These offspring, which the elves refer to as soul sib-
lings, are believed to have a special, intertwined destiny
