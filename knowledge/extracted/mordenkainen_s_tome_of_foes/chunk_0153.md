CHAPTER 6 I BESTIARY 
DUERGAR DESPOT 
Duergar despots replace parts of their bodies with me-
chanical devices that they control through their psionic 
abilities. 
DuERGAR HAMMERER 
The hammerer is a digging machine with a duergar 
strapped inside it-typically a punishment for those 
whose work ethic wavers. The machine's mechanism 
transforms the captive duergar's pain into energy that 
powers the device, which is typically used to dig tunnels 
and repel invaders. 
DUERGAR KAVALRACHNI 
The kavalrachni are duergar cavalry, trained to fight 
while riding steeders. 
DUERGAR MIND MASTER 
The feared duergar mind masters usually operate as 
spies, both inside and beyond a duergar stronghold. 
Their psionically augmented abilities enable them to see 
through illusions with ease and shrink down to minia-
ture size to spy on their targets.
