knew that in many cases, procedures that devils ob-
served and obeyed as laws were merely traditions, and 
failing to observe a tradition carries no penalty accord-
ing to the law of the Hells. 
Glasya's scheme involved using counterfeit currency 
to buy souls in Minauros, then selling them soon after to 
turn an incredible profit. When the truth of her dealings 
became apparent, she defended her actions based on the 
legal definition of a coin as minted in Minauros. 
According to law, the gold composition of a coin was 
strictly defined at the time of the coin's creation, but no 
law governed a coin's state after it left the mint. As long 
as it was made in the mint, it was legal currency. 
Glasya got around the law by transmuting lead to gold, 
then having coins minted from the substance. After she 
claimed her currency and her coin legions spent it on 
her purchases, the magic expired and the gold became 
lead once more. 
Asmodeus, although he couldn't punish Glasya for 
breaking the law, decided to discipline her by doing 
something only he could do: making her an archdevil. 
He reasoned that, now that she was effectively tied to 
a single layer of the Hells and saddled with responsi-
bilities in her capacity as prison warden, her ambitions 
would be kept in check. 
AN IRONIC SPHERE OF INFLUENCE 
To make Glasya's workload even more onerous (and 
to serve as an ironic form of punishment), Asmodeus 
decreed that Glasya could entice souls into the Nine 
Hells only through delving into matters of contracts, 
bargains, and legalities. She and her agents offer mortal 
petitioners advice on how to manipulate or circumvent 
the law, or to identify escape clauses- all to ensure that 
whatever they desire can be obtained without violating a 
legal precedent. 
Her petitioners want power, money, and love, but they 
want to come by it within the bounds of the law. An am-
bitious prince who is entitled by law to inherit his par-
ents' wealth but doesn't want to murder them might ask 
for help, and Glasya's agents provide it by arranging for 
them to die in an accident. 
A notable portion of Glasya's petitioners are souls who 
have pledged themselves to another Lord of the Nine 
and want out of the bargain. Her minions scour every 
contract struck with another devil and approach mortals 
whose contracts contain loopholes. In return for giving 
their souls to her instead, such individuals learn how to 
break the contract and negate whatever price the con-
tract says they must pay. 
BAALZEBUL 
T HROUGH SUFFICIENT PENANCE AND GRACE, EVEN T HE 
lowliest can redeem themselves. Am I not a living testament 
to that fact? 
-Baalzebul 
Maladomini was once a bustling realm of vibrant cities 
and a panoply of roads, gardens, and bridges. It was the 
center of the Hells' bureaucracy, where every edict, law, 
and order was dutifully copied and filed away. With each 
passing year, the devils would add more fortresses and 
archives to Maladomini to house all their records. 
Then came the single greatest act of treachery in the 
annals of the Nine Hells. At the time, the archdevil Baal-
zebul was so powerful that he ruled two layers of the 
Hells, Maladomini and Malbolge. He conspired to top-
ple Asmodeus and replace him, which in itself was not 
a crime. But in order to work his plans, he knowingly 
altered documents that passed into his care with the 
intent of confounding the apparatus of the bureaucracy. 
Before his scheme could come to fruition, he was caught 
and subjected to the most bizarre of punishments. 
In that time long past, Baalzebul believed that he 
could cast Asmodeus as incompetent and amass a force 
to replace him before Asmodeus's allies could act, but 
his calculations failed to take into account the unpre-
dictability of the Blood War. A sudden offensive from 
the Abyss struck Avernus just as Baalzebul was about 
to put his plan in motion. Baalzebul directed most of his 
shield legions to stay out of the fight, instead of helping 
to hold the line against the demons, so that he could use 
them in staging his coup. The absence of those legions, 
however, enabled the horde to push close to the door-
step of Dis. 
Baalzebul was forced to abandon his plans, realizing 
that the Nine Hells would be of little use to him if it was 
overrun with demons, and ultimately he united with the 
other archdevils to turn back the invasion. But when 
an investigation of the events uncovered his treachery, 
Baalzebul didn't submit to punishment, and Maladomini 
was wracked with fighting as the other Lords of the 
Nine took to the field against the conspirator. The result-
ing devastation left much of the layer in ruins. 
After Baalzebul was overwhelmed and defeated, As-
modeus stripped him of his rulership of Malbolge but 
left him in charge of Maladomini, albeit with a new set 
of duties. Asmodeus knew that Baalzebul's superior 
intellect and propensity for lying would make him the 
ideal representative of the bureaucracy of the Hells in 
the worlds of mortals. So, to ensure his loyalty while 
taking advantage of his talents, Asmodeus enacted two 
laws concerning him. 
First, whenever Baalzebul lied to a devil, he would 
transform into a slug-like creature, hideous to all who 
beheld him, for one year. This penalty was retroactive, 
covering several millennia of deceptions and untruths-
and only recently has Baalzebul worked off all those 
transgressions and been returned to his former human-
oid form. In all that time, he has not told a lie to another 
devil, and his continued honesty is motivated by his de-
sire to keep his current appearance.
