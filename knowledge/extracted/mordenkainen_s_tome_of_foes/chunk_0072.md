DWARVES IN THE WORLD 
The tables below are designed to add depth to a dwarf 
character by offering possible reasons why the character 
left the clan for the life of an adventurer and a set of per-
sonality quirks tailored for dwarven sensibilities. 
DWARF ADVENTURER STORY HOOKS 
d6 
Hook 
You were accused of stealing a fellow artisan's item 
and claiming it as your work. Innocent or guilty, you 
were made an outcast. 
2 
Your wanderlust prompted you to shirk your duties 
as a crafter in favor of wandering the world. Your clan 
isn't pleased with this choice. 
3 
You became separated from your clan due to an 
earthquake, a drow slave raid, or similar event and 
hope to return home. 
4 
You were assigned to become a merchant by the 
priests of Morad in and have yet to forgive them for 
their mistake. You should be working a forge, not 
wandering the outside world! 
S 
You are a spy, traveling incognito to gather informa-
tion for the clan elders. 
6 
You struggle to resist the lure of Abbathor, but can't 
hold it at bay. Better to walk the world and sate your 
greed on non-dwarves. 
DWARF QUIRKS 
d8 
Quirk 
Water from the sky! It always surprises you. 
2 
You have a fascination with the ocean and its chaos. 
3 
Any creature larger than a human makes you nervous. 
4 
You prefer to travel with a parasol or similar item that 
puts a comforting shelter over your head. 
S 
You prefer to sleep during the day. 
6 
You speak Common or any other non-dwarf language 
only if you must. 
7 
For you, relaxation is putting in a day at the forge. 
8 
You avoid contact with other dwarves, since you mis-
trust those who would leave their strongholds. 
DUERGAR TABLES 
Most of the tables in this section are duergar-themed 
versions of the information for dwarves that's presented 
above and in the Player's Handbook. 
In the tables, a name in bold refers to a stat block in 
the Monster Manual. 
DUERGAR RAIDING PARTIES 
When duergar emerge from the Underdark, they gen-
erally do so in the form of small but vicious raiding 
parties. Use the following tables to generate a band of 
duergar raiders and some additional details of their sit-
uation. Roll once on each line of the Group Composition 
table and once on each table that follows it.
