Ifyou use a weapon that has the ammunition property
to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an
improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in
the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage
when used in this way.
Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse
weapon, you use your choice of your Strength
or
Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. Vou
must use the same modifier for both rolls.
Heavy. Small creatures
have disadvantage
on attack
rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and
bulk make it toa large for a Small creature
to use
effectively.
Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle,
making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
Loading. Because of the time required to load this
weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition
from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction
to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can
normally make.
Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged
attack has a range shown in parentheses
after the
ammunition
or thrown property. The range lists two
numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet,
and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range.
When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have
disadvantage
on the attack rolI. Vou can't attack a target
beyond the weapon's long range.
Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when
you attack with it.
Special. A weapon with the special property has
unusual rules governing its use, explained in the
weapon's description
(see "Special Weapons" later in
this section).
Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you
can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the
weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability
modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you
would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For
example, ifyou throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,
but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your
Strength
or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the
finesse property.
Two.Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use.
Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two
hands. A damage value in parentheses
appears with the
property-the
damage when the weapon is used with
two hands to make a melee attack.

IMPROVISED
WEAPONS
Sometimes
characters
don't have their weapons and
have to attack with whatever is dose at hand. An
improvised weapon indudes
any object you can wield
in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a
frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.
In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar
to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For
example, a table leg is akin to a dub. At the DM's option.
a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar
object as if it were that weapon and use his or her
proficiency bonus.
