COMMAND
/st-/evel enchantment
Casting Time: I action
Range: 60 feet
Components:
V
Duration: 1 round
Vou speak a one-word command to a creature you can
see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or follow the command on its next turno
The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it
doesn't understand
your language, or if your command
is directly harmful to it.
Some typical commands
and their effects follow. Vou
might issue a command other than one described
here.
If you do so, the OM determines
how the target behaves.
If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.
Approach. The target moves toward you by the
shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it
moves within 5 feet of YOU.
Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then
ends its turno
F/ee. The target spends its turn moving away from
you by the fastest available means.
Grove/. The target falls prone and then ends its turno
Ha/t. The target doesn't move and takes no actions.
A fiying creature
stays aloft, provided that it is able to
do sO. If it must move to stay aloft, it fiies the minimum
distance needed to remain in the air.
At Higher Leve/s. When you east this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd leveI or higher, you can affeet one
additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The

COMMUNE
5th-levei divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range:SeIf
Components: V, S, M (incense and aviaI of holy or
unholy water)
Duration: 1 minute
Vou contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to
three questions that can be answered with a yes or no.
Vou must ask your questions before the spell ends. Vou
receive a correct answer for each questiono
Oivine beings aren't necessarily
omniscient, so you
might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question
pertains
to information that lies beyond the deity's
knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be
misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the OM
might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.
Ifyou cast the spell two or more times before finishing
your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent
chance for each casting after the first that you get no
answer. The OM makes this roll in secret.
