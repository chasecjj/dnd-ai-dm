SPELLCASTING
Focus
Vou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting
focus for your paladin spells.
DIVINE
SMITE
Starting at 2nd leveI, when you hit a creature with a
melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell
slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to
the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a
1st-levei spell slot, plus ld8 for each spelllevel
higher
than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases
by ld8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.
DIVINE
HEALTH
By 3rd levei, the divine magic flowing through you
makes you immune to disease.
SACRED OATH
When you reach 3rd leveI, you swear the oath that binds
you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been
in a preparatory
stage, committed to the path but not
yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion,
the Oath of the Ancients, ar the Oath of Vengeance, all
detailed at the end of the c1ass description.
Your choice grants you features at 3rd leveI and again
at 7th, 15th, and 20th leveI. Those features include oath
spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
OATH
SPELLS
Each oath has a list of associated
spells. Vou gain
access to these spells at the leveIs specified in the oath
description.
Once you gain access to an oath spell, you
always have it prepared.
Oath spells don't count against
the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the
paladin spelllist,
the spell is nonetheless
a paladin
spell for you.
CHANNEL
DIVINITY
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel
magical effects. Each ChanneI Divinity option provided
by your oath explains how to use it.
When you use your ChanneI Divinity, you choose
which option to use. Vou must then finish a short ar long
rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
When you use such an effect from this c1ass, the DC
equals your paladin spell save De.
ABILITY
SCORE IMPROVEMENT
When you reach 4th leveI, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th leveI, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, ar you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
EXTRA ATTACK
Beginning at 5th leveI, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turno
AURA OF PROTECTION
Starting at 6th leveI, whenever you ar a friendly creature
within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the
creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your
Charisma
modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). Vou
must be conscious to grant this bonus.
At 18th levei, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
AURA OF COURAGE
Starting at 10th leveI. you and friendly creatures
within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you
are conscious.
At 18th levei, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
IMPROVED DIVINE
SMITE
By 11th leveI, you are so suffused with righteous
rnight that ali your melee weapon strikes carry divine
power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a
meIee weapon, the creature
takes an extra ld8 radiant
damage. lf you also use your Divine Smite with an
attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your
Divine Smite.
CLEANSING
TOUCH
Beginning at 14th leveI, you can use your action to
end one spell on yourself ar on one willing creature
that you touch.
Vou can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma
modifier (a minimum of once). Vou
regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
SACRED OATHS
Becorning a paladin invoIves taking vows that commit
the paladin to the cause of righteousness,
an active
path of fighting wickedness.
The final oath, taken
when he ar she reaches 3rd levei, is the culmination
of ali the paladin's training. Some characters
with this
c1ass don't consider themselves
true paladins until
they have reached 3rd levei and made this oath. For
others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality,
an official stamp on what has always been true in the
paladin's heart.
OATH
OF DEVOTION
The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest
ideaIs ofjustice, virtue, and arder. Sometimes
called
cavaliers, white knights. ar holy warriors,
these
paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armar.
