Those block eyes, cold as a winter storm, were staring
right into her heart and the sudden seriousness in his
voicejolted her.
"What is it they say?" he asked. "One's a curiosity, two's
a conspiracy-"
"Three's a curse," shefinished.
"You think I haven't heard

"Iknowyou

"[t's not as if l'm plumbing
the depths ofyour

girl. That is the burden of every tiefling. Some break under
it, some make it the millstone around their neck, some
revel in it." He tilted his head again, scrutinizingher,

M. Evans, Brimstone Angels
To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer
violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and
fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to
twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a
pact struck generations ago infused the essence of
Asmodeus-overlord
of the Nine Hells-into
their
bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not
their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which
they and their children and their children's children
will always be held accountable.
INFERNAL
BLOODLINE
Tieflings are derived fram human bloodlines, and in the
broadest possible sense, they stilllook humano However,
their infernal heritage has left a elear imprint on their
appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any
of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a
ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle's,
and some spiral upward like an antelopes' horns. They
have thick tails, four to tive feet long, which lash or coil
around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their
canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are
solid colors-black,
red, white, silver, or gold-with
no
visible selera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full
range of human coloration, but also inelude various
shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind
their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark
red, blue, or purple.
SELF- RELIANT
AND SUSPICIOUS
Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in
human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters
of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers,

thieves, or crime lords, Sometimes
they live among
other minority populations
in enclaves where they are
treated with more respect.
Lacking a homeland, tieftings know that they have
to make their own way in the world and that they have
to be strong to survive, They are not quick to trust
anyone who claims to be a friend. but when a tiefling's
companions
demonstrate
that they trust him or her,
the tiefting learns to extend the same trust to them,
And once a tiefting gives someone loyalty, the tiefting
is a firm friend or ally for life,
TIEFLING
NAMES
Tiefting names fali into three broad categories. Tieftings
born into another culture typically have names reftective
of that culture. Some have names derived from the
Infernallanguage,
passed down through generations,
that reftect their fiendish heritage. And some younger
tieftings. striving to find a place in the world, adopt a
na me that signifies a virtue or other concept and then
try to embody that concept. For some. the chosen na me
is a noble quest. For others. it's a grim destiny.
