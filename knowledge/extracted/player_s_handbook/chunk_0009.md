in chapter 4, and might be willing to work with you to
craft a background that's a more precise fit for your
character concept.
A background gives your character a background
feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills,
and it might also give you additionallanguages
or
proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this
information, along with the personality information
you develop, on your character sheet.
YOUR CHARACTER'S
ABILITIES
Take your character's ability scores and race into
account as you flesh out his or her appearance
and personality. A very strong character with low
Intelligence might think and behave very differently
from a very smart character with low Strength.
For example, high Strength usually corresponds
with a burly or athletic body, while a character with
low Strength might be scrawny or plump.
A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and
slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be
either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.
A character with high Constitution usually looks
healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A
character with low Constitution might be sickly or frai!.
A character with high Intelligence might be highly
inquisitive and studious, while a character with low
Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.
A character with high Wisdom has good judgment,
empathy, and a general awareness of what's going on.
A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded,
foolhardy, or oblivious.
A character with high Charisma exudes confidence,
which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating
presence. A character with a low Charisma might come
across as abrasive, inarticulate, or tímido
BUILDING
BRUENOR,
STEP 4
Bob fills in some of Bruenor's basic details: his name,
his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment
(Iawful good). His high Strength and Constitution
suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence
suggests a degree of forgetfulness.
Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line,
but his elan was expelled from its homeland when
Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith
in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor
has a heroic destiny-to
reelaim his homeland-so
Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf.
He notes the proficiencies and special feature this
background gives him.
Bob has a pretty elear picture of Bruenor's personality
in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in
the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is
a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends
and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff,
snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness
from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor
believes that no one is above the law.
Given his history, Bruenor's bond is obvious: he
aspires to someday reelaim Mithral Hall, his homeland,
from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out.

1 I STEP-BY-STEP
CHARACTERS
His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature-he
has a
soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to
show mercy even when it might not be warranted.
5. CHOOSE E
UIPMENT
Your elass and background determine your character's
starting
equipment,
ineluding weapons, armor, and
other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your
character sheet. Ali such items are detailed in chapter 5.
Instead of taking the gear given to you byyour elass
and background, you can purchase your starting
equipment. Vou have a number of gold pieces (gp)
to spend based on your elass, as shown in chapter 5.
Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in
that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket
at no cost (see the trinket table at the end of chapter 5).
Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can
carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight
(in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15.
Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.
ARMOR
CLASS
Your Armor Class (AC)represents how well your
character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that
contribute to your AC inelude the armor you wear, the
shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not ali
characters wear armor or carry shields, however.
Without armor or a shield, your character's AC equals
10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character
wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your
AC using the rules in chapter 5. Record your ACon
your character sheet.
Your character needs to be proficient with armor and
shields to wear and use them effectively,and your armor
and shield proficiencies are determined by your elass.
There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a
shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained
in chapter 5.
Some spells and elass features give you a different
way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features
that give you different ways to calculate your AC,you
choose which one to use.
WEAPONS
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the
modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and
the damage you deal when you hit.
When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll
a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you
are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate
ability modifier.
For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that
has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your
Dexterity modifier instead.
For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon thal
has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use
your Strength modifier inslead.
