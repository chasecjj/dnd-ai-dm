DRAGON
WINGS
At 14th levei, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of
dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed
equal to your current speed. You can create these wings
as a bonus action on your turno They last until you
dismiss them as a bonus action on your turno
You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor
unless the armor is made to accommodate
them, and
clothing not made to accommodate
your wings might
be destroyed when you manifest them.
DRACONIC
PRESENCE
Beginning at 18th leveI, you can channel the dread
presence
of your dragon ancestor, causing those around
you to become awestruck
or frightened. As an action,
you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power
and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a
distance of 60 feel. For I minute or until you lose your
concentration
(as if you were casting a concentration
spell), each hostile creature
that starts its turn in this
aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose
fear) until the aura ends. A creature
that succeeds on
this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.
WILD MAGIC
Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos
that underlie the order of creation. You might have
endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps
through a planar portalleading
to Limbo, the Elemental
Planes, or lhe mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you
were blessed by a powerful fey creature
or marked bya
demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with
no apparent cause or reason. However it carne to be, this
chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlel.
WILD
MAGIC
SURGE
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st levei, your
spellcasting
can unleash surges of untamed magic.
lmmediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st levei
or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a
I, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random
magical effect.
TIDES
OF CHAOS
Starting at 1st levei, you can manipulate
the forces of
chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw. Once you do sO.you must
6nish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
Any time before you regain the use of lhis feature, the
DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table
immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of Ist levei or
higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
BEND
LUCK
Starting at 6th levei, you have the ability to twist fate
using your wild magic. When another creature you can
see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving
throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery
points to roll Id4 and apply the number rolled as a
bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's
roll. You
can do so after the creature
rolls but before any effects
of the roll occur.
CONTROLLED
CHAOS
At 14th levei, you gain a modicum of control over the
surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the
Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use
either number.
SPELL BOMBARDMENT
Beginning at 18th leveI, the harmful energy of your
spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and
roll the highest number possible on any of lhe dice,
choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to
the damage. You can use the feature only once per turno
