PA RT 3 I SPELLS
decide the visual appearance
of these servants and their
attire. They are completely obedient to your orders.
Each servant can perform any task a normal human
servant could perform, but they can't attack or take
any action that would directly harm another creature.
Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold
clothes. light tires. serve food, pour wine, and so on.
The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but
can't leave it. Furnishings
and other objects created
by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the
mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures
inside
the extradimensional
space are expelled into the open
spaces nearest to the entrance.

in a trench, erect or f1atten a wall, or form a pillar. The
extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's

you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower
the square's e1evation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up

changes to complete.
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend
concentrating

natural stone or
stone construction.
Rocks and structures
shift to
accommodate
