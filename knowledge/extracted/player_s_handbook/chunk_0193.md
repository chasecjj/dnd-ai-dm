MAJOR IMAGE
3rd-Ievel illusion
Casting Time: I action
Range: 120 feet
Components:
V,S, M (a bit of f1eece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Voucreate the image of an object, a creature, ar some
other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a
20.foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you
can see within range and lasts for the duration. lt
seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. Vou
can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a
sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a
creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a
troglodyte's stench).
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you
can use your action to cause the image to move to
any other spot within range. As the image changes
location, you can alter its appearance so that its
movements appear natural for the image. For example,
if you create an image of a creature and move it, you
can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different
sounds at different times, even making it carry on a
conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
iIlusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an iIlusion with a successfullntelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save De. lf a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
can see through the image, and its other sensory
qualities become faint to the creature.
At Higher LeveIs. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th leveI or higher, the spelllasts
until
dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

MASS SUGGESTION
6th./evel enchantment
Casting Time: I action
Range: 60 feet
Components:
V,M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of
honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
Duration: 24 hours
Vousuggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence
or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures
of your choice that you can see within range and that
can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be
charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must
be worded in such a manner as to make the course of
action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab
itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do
some other obviously harmful act automatically negates
the effect of the spell.
Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested
activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell
ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
Vou can also specify conditions that will trigger a
special activity during the duration. For example, you
might suggest that a group of soldiers give ali their
money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't
met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.
lf you or any of your companions damage a creature
affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.
At Higher LeveIs. When you cast this spell using
a 7th.leveI spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When
you use an 8th.level spell slot, the duration is 30 days.
When you use a 9th.level spell slot, the duration is a
year and a day.
