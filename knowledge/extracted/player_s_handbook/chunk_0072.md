At 2nd levei, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic
within yourself. This wellspring is represented
by
sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of
magical effects.

reach higher leveis. as shown in the Sorcery Points
column of the Sorcerer
table. You can never have

finish a long rest.

unexpended
sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on
your turno The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost
of creating a spell slot of a given leveI. Vou can create
spell slots no higher in leveI than 5th.
Choose a sorcerous
origin, which describes
the
source of your innate magical power: Draconic
Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the
c1ass description.
Your choice grants you features when you choose it at
1st leveI and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th leveI.
SPELLCASTING
Focus
Vou can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting
focus for your sorcerer spells.
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or
ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with
arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin,
fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting
and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spelllist.
SPELLCASTING
CANTRIPS
At 1st leveI, you know four cantrips of your choice from
the sorcerer spelllist.
Vou learn additional sorcerer
cantrips of your choice at higher leveis, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer
table.
SPELL SLOTS
The Sorcerer
table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st levei and higher. To cast
one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell's levei or higher. Vou regain ali expended spell
slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-levei spell burning
hands and have a 1st-levei and a 2nd-levei spell slot
available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.
SPELLS KNOWN

sorcerer spelllist.
The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer
table
shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your
choice. Each of these spells must be of a levei for which
you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd
levei in this c1ass, you can learn one new spell of 1st
or 2nd leveI.
Additionally, when you gain a levei in this c1ass,
you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer
spelllist,
which also must be of a levei for which you
have spell slots.

is your spellcasting
ability for your sorcerer
