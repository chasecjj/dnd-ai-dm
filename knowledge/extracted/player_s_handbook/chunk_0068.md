EQUIPMENT
You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:
(a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword
(a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a
shortsword

explorer's pack
Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves' tools
EXPERTISE
At 1st leveI, choose two ofyour skill proficiencies, or
one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with
thieves' tooIs. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
ability check you make that uses either of the chosen
proficiencies.
At 6th levei, you can choose two more of your
proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain
this benefit.
SNEAK ATTACK
Beginning at 1st levei, you know how to strike subtly
and exploit a foe's distraction.
Once per turn, you can
deal an extra Id6 damage to one creature you hit with
an attack if you have advantage on the attack rol!. The
attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another
enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy
isn't incapacitated,
and you don't have disadvantage
on
the attack rol!.
The amount of the extra damage increases
as you
gain leveis in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack
column of the Rogue table.
THIEVES'
CANT
During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a
secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to
hide messages
in seemingly normal conversation.
Only
another creature
that knows thieves' cant understands
such messages.
lt takes four times longer to convey sue h
a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
In addition, you understand
a set of secret signs and
symbols used to convey short, simple messages,
such
as whether an area is dangerous
or the territory of a
thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the
people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe
house for thieves on the run.
CUNNING
ACTION
Starting
at 2nd levei, your quick thinking and agility
allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a
bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This
action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage,
or Hide action.
ROGUISH
ARCHETYPE
At 3rd leveI, you choose an archetype that you emulate
in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin,
or Arcane Trickster, ali detailed at the end of the class
description.
Your archetype choice grants you features
at 3rd levei and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th leve!.
ABILITY
SCORE IMPROVEMENT
When you reach 4th levei, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th,
16th, and 19th levei, you can increase one ability score
of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase
an ability score above 20 using this feature.
UNCANNY
DODGE
Starting
at 5th levei, when an attacker that you can see
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to
halve the attack's damage against you.
EVASION
Beginning at 7th levei, you can nimbly dodge out of the
way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery
breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected
to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only
half damage if you fai!'
RELIABLE
T ALENT
By 11th levei, you have refined your chosen skills until
they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability
check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can
treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
BLINDSENSE
Starting at 14th levei, ifyou are able to hear, you are
aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature
within lO feet ofyou.
SLIPPERY MIND
By 15th leveI, you have acquired greater mental
strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
ELUSIVE
Beginning at 18th levei, you are so evasive that
attackers
rarely gain the upper hand against you. No
attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't
incapacitated.
