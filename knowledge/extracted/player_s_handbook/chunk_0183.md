lriggers include opening lhal objecl, approaching wilhin
a cerlain dislance of lhe objecl, or seeing or reading lhe
glyph. Once a glyph is lriggered, lhis spell ends.
Voucan furlher retine lhe lrigger so lhe spell aclivales
only under cerlain circumslances
or according lo
physical characlerislics
(such as heighl or weighl),
crealure kind (for example, the ward could be seI lo
affecl aberralions or drow), or alignment. Voucan also
seI condilions for crealures lhal don'l lrigger lhe glyph,
such as lhose who say a cerlain password.
When you inscribe lhe glyph, choose expiosive runes
or a spell glyph.
Explosive Runes. When lriggered, lhe glyph erupls
with magical energy in a 20-fool-radius sphere cenlered
on lhe glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each
crealure in lhe area musl make a Dexlerily saving
lhrow. A crealure takes Sd8 acid, cold, tire, lighlning, or
thunder damage on a failed saving lhrow (your choice
when you creale the glyph), or half as much damage on a
successful one.
SpelJ Glyph. Vou can slore a prepared spell of
3rd levei or lower in lhe glyph by casling it as parI
of crealing lhe glyph. The spell musl largel a single
crealure or an area. The spell being slored has no
immediale effecl when casl in lhis way. When lhe glyph
is lriggered, lhe slored spell is cast. If lhe spell has a
largel, il largels lhe crealure lhal lriggered lhe glyph.
If lhe spell affecls an area, lhe area is cenlered on
lhal crealure. Ir lhe spell summons hoslile crealures
or creales harmful objecls or lraps, lhey appear as
close as possible lo lhe inlruder and attack it. Ir lhe
spell requires concenlralion, il !asls unlil lhe end of ils
full duralion.
At Higher Leveis. When you casl lhis spell using
a spell slol of 41h levei or higher, lhe damage of an
expiosive runes glyph increases by Id8 for each si01
levei above 3rd. If you creale a spell glyph, you can slore
any spell of up lo lhe same leve! as lhe si01you use for
lhe giyph of warding.
