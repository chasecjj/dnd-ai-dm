worlds of OUNGEONS& ORAGONS-
Walerdeep, the Free Cily of Greyhawk, or
even uncanny Sigil, the City of Ooors-
overwhelms
lhe senses. Voices chatter in
counlless
differenl languages. The smells
of cooking in dozens of differenl cuisines
mingle with lhe odors of crowded slreels and poor
sanitalion.
Buildings in myriad architeclural
styles
display lhe diverse origins of their inhabilants.
And lhe people lhemselves-people
of varying size,

in a dazzling speclrum
of slyles and hues-represenl
many differenl races,
from diminulive halflings and stoul dwarves to
majeslically beauliful elves, mingling among a variety
of human ethnicities.
Scattered
among lhe members of these more common
races are the lrue exolics: a hulking dragonborn
here,
pushing his way lhrough lhe crowd, and a sly liefling
there, lurking in lhe shadows with mischief in her eyes.
A group of gnomes laughs as one of lhem activales a
clever wooden loy lhal moves of ils own accord. Half-
elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans,
without fully belonging to lhe races of eilher of lheir
parenls. And lhere, well oul of lhe sunlighl, is a lone
drow-a
fugilive from lhe sublerranean
expanse of
the Underdark,
trying to make his way in a world
thal fears his kind.
CHOOSING
A RACE
Humans are lhe most common people in lhe worlds of
0&0, bul they live and work alongside dwarves, elves,
halflings, and counlless olher fanlaslic species. Your
character
belongs lo one of lhese peoples.
Nol every inlelligent race of lhe mulliverse is
appropriale
for a player-conlrolled
advenlurer.
Owarves,
elves, halflings, and humans are the most common
races to produce the sorl of advenlurers
who make up
lypical parlies. Oragonborn,
gnomes, half-elves, half-
orcs, and lieflings are less common as adventurers.
Orow, a subrace of elves, are also uncommon.
Your choice of race affects many differenl aspecls of
your character. /t establishes
fundamenlal
qualities thal
exisl IhroughoUI your characler's
adventuring
career.
When making lhis decision, keep in mind lhe kind of
character you wanl lOplay. For example, a halfling could
be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a
lough warrior, and an elf can be a maSler of arcane magic,
Your characler
race nol only affecIs your abilily scores
and lrails bul also provides lhe cues for building your
characler's
story. Each race's descriplion
in lhis chapler
includes information to help you roleplay a characler
of
lhal race, including personality,
physical appearance,
features of sociely, and racial alignmenl lendencies.
These delails are suggeslions
to help you think aboul
your characler;
adventurers
can deviate widely from lhe
norm for lheir race. /t's worthwhile
to consider why your
character
is differenl, as a helpful way to think aboul
your characler's
background
and personalily.
RACIAL TRAITS

can choose any age for your characler, which could
provide an explanation
for some of your ability scores.
For example, if you play a young or very old character,
your age could explain a particularly
low Strength
or
Conslitulion
score, while advanced age could accounl
for a high Inlelligence or Wisdom.
