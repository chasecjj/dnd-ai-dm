An object that bears no resemblance
to a weapon
deals ld4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type
appropriate
to the object). Ir a characler
uses a ranged
weapon lo make a melee atlack, or throws a melee
weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also
deals ld4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a
normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
SILVERED
WEAPONS
Some monsters that have immunity or resistance
to nonmagical weapons are susceptible
to silver
weapons, so caulious adventurers
invest extra coin to
plate their weapons with silver. Vou can silver a single
weapon or ten pieces of ammunition
for 100 gp. This
cost represents
not only the price of the silver, but the
time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon
without making it less effective.
SPECIAL
WEAPONS
Weapons with special rules are described
here.
Lance. Vou have disadvantage
when you use a lance
to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance
requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.
Net. A Large or smaller creature
hit by a net is
restrained
until it is freed. A net has no effect on
PART 1 I EQUIPMENT
creatures
that are formless, or creatures
that are Huge
or larger. A creature
can use its action to make a DC 10
Strength
check, freeing itself or another creature
within
its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the
net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it,
ending the effect and destroying the net.
When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction
to atlack with a net, you can make only one attack
regardless
of the number of attacks you can
normally make.
AnVENTURING

case, make a ranged attack against a creature
or object,
treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the
target takes 2d6 acid damage.
