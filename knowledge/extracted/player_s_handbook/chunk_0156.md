Areas ofMagie.
The area of another spell or magical
effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere.
If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of
the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
For example, the liames created by a wall of fire are
suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall
if the overlap is large enough.
Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a
creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while
the creature or object is in i!.
Magie ltems.
The properties and powers of
magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For
example, a +llongsword
in the sphere functions as a
nonmagicallongsword.
A magic weapon's properties and powers are
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon
or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
(for example, ifyou fire a magic arrow or throw a magic
spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the
item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
Magieal TraveI. Teleportation and planar travei
fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the
destination or the departure point for such magical
traveI. A portal to another location, world, or plane of
existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional
space such as that created by the rope trick spell,
temporarily doses while in the sphere.
Creatures
and Objeets. A creature or object
summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out
of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly
reappears once the space the creature occupied is no
longer within the sphere.
Dispel Magie. Spells and magical effects such as
dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the
spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't
nullify each other.

Antipathy.
Thc cnchantmcnt causes creatures of the
kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the
area and avoid the targe!. When such a creature can
see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature

by the target, the creature must use its movement to

move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see
the targe!. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from
the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer
frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if
it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of i!.
Sympathy.
The enchantment causes the specified
creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target
while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a
creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it,
the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area
or move within reach of the targe!. When the creature
has done so, it can't willingly move away fram the targe!.
If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected
creature, the affected crealure can make a Wisdom
saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
Ending the Elfeet. If an affected creature ends its
turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see
it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving thraw. On a
successful save, the creature is no longer affected by
the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or
attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by
the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every
24 hours while the spell persists.
A creature that successfully saves against this effect
is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be
affected again.
