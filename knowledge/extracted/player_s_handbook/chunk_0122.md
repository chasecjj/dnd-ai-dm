PREREQ_U_IS_I_T_E_S
_
To qualify for a new c1ass, you must meet the ability score
prerequisites
for both your current c1ass and your new
one, as shown in the Multiclassing
Prerequisites
tabJe.
For example, a barbarian
who decides to multiclass into
the druid c1ass must have both Strength
and Wisdom
scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that
a beginning character
receives, you must be a quick
study in your new c1ass, having a natural aptitude that
is reAected by higher-than-average
ability scores.

POINTS
AND HIT
DICE
Vou gain the hit points from your new c1ass as described
for leveis after 1st. You gain the 1st-leveI hit points for a
c1ass only when you are a 1st-levei character.
Vou add together the Hit Dice granted by ali your
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are
the same die type, you can simply pool them together.
For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a
dlO. so ifyou are a palndin 5/fighter 5, you have ten dlO
Hit Dice. Ifyour classes give you Hit Dice of different
types, keep track of them separate!y. If you are a paladin
5jcleric 5, for example, you have five dlO Hit Dice and
five d8 Hit Dice.
The experience
point cost to gain a levei is always
based on your total character
leve!. as shown in the
Character Advancement
table in chapter 1, not your levei
in a particular
c1ass. So, if you are a c1eric 6jfighter 1,
you must gain enough XP to reach 8th levei before you
can take your second levei as a fighter or your seventh
levei as a c1eric.

HE COMBINATION
Of ABILITY
SCORES, RACE,
class, and background
defines your
character's
capabilities
in the game, and
the personal details you create set your
character
apart from every other character.
Even within your class and race, you have
options to fine-tune what your character
can do. But this chapter is for players who-with
the
DM's permission-want
to go a step further.
This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for
customizing your character: multiclassing
and feats.
Multiclassing lets you combine classes together,
and feats are special options you can choose instead
of increasing your ability scores as you gain leveis.
Your DM decides whether these options are available
in a campaign.
Multiclassing allows you to gain leveis in multi pie
classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those
classes to realize a character
concept that might not be
reAected in one of the standard
class options.
With this role, you have the option of gaining a levei
in a new class whenever you advance in levei, instead
of gaining a leveI in your current class. Your leveis in
ali your classes are added together to determine your
character
leveI. For example, if you have three leveIs in
wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-levei character.
As you advance in leveis, you might primarily remain
a member of your original class with just a few leveis
in another class, or you might change course entire!y,
never looking back at the c1ass you left behind. Vou
might even start progressing
in a third or fourth c1ass.
Compared to a single-c1ass character
of the same levei,
you'lI sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

MULTICLASStNG
EXAMPLE
Gary is playing a 4th-levei fighter. When his character
earns
enough
experience
points to reach Sth levei, Gary decides
that his character
will multielass
instead
of continuing
to
progress
as a fighter. Gary's fighter has been spending
a lot
of time with Dave's rogue, and has even been doing some
jobs on the side for the local thieves'
guild as a bruiser. Gary
decides
that his character
will multielass
into the rogue e1ass,
and thus his character
becomes
a 4th.level
fighter and lst-
levei rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue
1).
When Gary's character
earns enough
experience
to
reach 6th levei, he can decide whether
to add another
fighter levei (becoming
a fighter S/rogue
1), another
rogue
levei (becoming
a fighter 4/rogue
2), ar a levei in a third
e1ass, perhaps
dabbling
in wizardry thanks
to the tome of
mysterious
lore he acquired
(becoming
a fighter 4/rogue
1/
wizard 1).
Vour proficiency bonus is always based on your total
character
levei, as shown in the Character
Advancement
table in chapter 1, not your levei in a particular
class.
For example, ifyou are a fighter 3/rogue 2, YOllhave the
proficiency bonlls of a 5th-levei character, which is +3.
