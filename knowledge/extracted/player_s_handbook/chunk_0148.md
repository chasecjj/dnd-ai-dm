It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the
ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher leveI.
To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a
feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the
druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must
also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells
known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies
otherwise, as the wizard's does.
CASTING A SPELL
When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules
are followed, regardless of the character's class or the
spell's effects.
Each spell description in chapter li begins with a block
of information, including the spell's name, levei,school
of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration.
The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.
CASTING
TIME
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some
spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more
time to cast.
BONUS ACTION
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. Vou
must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell,
provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action
this turno Vou can't cast another spell during the same
turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of I action.
REACTIONS
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells
take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast
in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a
reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when
you can do sO.
LONGE R CASTING
TIMES
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituais) require
more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you
cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single
action or reaction, you must spend your action each
turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your
concentration while you do so (see "Concentration"
below). ]f your concentration is broken, the spell fails,
but you don't expend a spell slot. ]f you want to try
casting the spell again, you must start over.
RANGE
The target of a spell must be within the spell's range.
For a spelllike magic missile, the target is a creature.
For a spelllike firebaJl, the target is the point in space
where the ball of fire erupts.
Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some
spells can target only a creature (including you) that you
touch. Other spells. such as the shield spell, affect only
you. These spells have a range of self.
Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate
from you also have a range of self, indicating that the
origin point af the spell's effect must be yau (see "Areas
af Effect" later in the this chapter).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't
interfere with concentration. The following factors can
break concentration:
Casting another speIl that requires concentration.
Vou lose concentration on a spell ifyou cast another
spell that requires concentration. Vou can't concen-
trate on two spells at once.
Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while
you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a
Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentra-
tion. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take,
whichever number is higher.lfyou
take damage from
multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's
breath, you make a separate saving throw for each
source of damage.
Being incapacilated
or kilIed. Vou lose concentration
on a spell if you are incapacitated or ifyou die.
THE
SCHOOLS
OF MAGIC
Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called
schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these
categories to ali spells, believing that ali magic functions in
essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous
study ar is bestowed by a deity.
The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no
rules oftheir own, although some rules refer to the schools.
Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some
of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers,
negate harmful effects, harm trespassers,
ar banish creatures
to other planes of existence.
Conjuration spells involve the transportation
of objects
and creatures from one location to another. Some spells
summon creatures ar objects to the caster's side, whereas
others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some
conjurations
create objects or effects out of nothing.
Divinalion spells reveal information, whether in the form of
secrets long forgoUen, glimpses of the future, the locations
of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, ar visions of
dislanl people or places.
Enchanlmenl
spells affecl lhe minds of olhers, influencing
ar controlling lheir behavior. Such spells can make enemies
see lhe casler as a friend, force crealures lo lake a course of
aclion, ar even conlrol anolher crealure like a puppet.
Evocalion spells manipulate
magical energy lo produce a
desired eITect. Some call up blasts offire ar lighlning. Olhers
channel posilive energy to heal wounds.
JIIusion spells deceive lhe senses ar minds of olhers. They
cause people lo see lhings lhal are nol lhere, lo miss lhings
lhat are there, to hear phanlom
noises, ar lo remember
lhings lhal never happened.
Some illusions creale phanlom
images lhal any creature can see, but lhe mosl insidious
illusions planl an image direclly in lhe mind of a crealure.
Necromancy spells manipulale
the energies oflife and
dealh. Such spells can granl an exlra reserve oflife force,
drain the life energy from anolher crealure, create the
undead, ar even bring the dead back to life.
Creating the undead lhrough lhe use of necromancy spells
such as animate
dead is not a good acl, and only evil caslers
use such spells frequenlly.
Transmulalion
spells change lhe properties of a crealure,
object, ar environmenl. They mighl lum an enemy inlo a
harmless creature. bolsler the slrength of an ally,make an
object move aI the casler's command, ar enhance a crealure's
innale healing abililies lo rapidly recover from injury.
Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its
range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.
COMPONENTS
A spell's components are the physical requirements you
must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description
indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S),
or material (M) components. Ifyou can't provide one
or more of a spell's components, you are unable to
cast the spell.
VERBAL (V)
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The
words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power;
rather, the particular combination of sounds, with
specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic
in molion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area
of silence, such as one created by the siJence spell, can't
cast a spell with a verbal component.
SOMATIC
(S)
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful
gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell
requires a somalic component, the caster must have free
use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.
MATERIAL
(M)
Casting some spells requires particular objects,
specified in parentheses in the component entry.
A character can use a component
pouch or a
speIlcasting
focus (found in chapter 5) in place of
the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is
indicated for a component, a character must have that
specific component before he or she can cast the spell.
If a spell states that a material component is
consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this
component for each casting of the spell.
A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these
components, but it can be the same hand that he or she
uses to perform somatic components.
DURATION
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists.
A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours,
or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last
until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.
INSTANTANEOUS
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms,
heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way
that can't be dispelled, beca use its magic exists only
for an instant.
CONCENTRATION
Some spells require you to maintain concentration
in order to keep their magic active. If you lose
concentration, such a spell ends.
If a spell must be maintained with concentralion,
that fact appears in its Duration entry, and lhe spell
specifics how long you can concentrate on it. Voucan
end concentration at any time (no action required).
