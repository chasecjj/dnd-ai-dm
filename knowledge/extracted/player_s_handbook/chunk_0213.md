you. Vour familiarily with the destinalion
determines
whelher you arrive lhere successfully. The DM rolls
dlOO and consults the table.
Familiarity. "Permanent
circle" means a permanent
teleportation
circle whose sigil sequence you know.
"Associaled object" means that you possess
an objecl
taken from the desired destination
within the last six
months, such as a book from a wizard's Iibrary, bed
linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a
lich's secret tombo
"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a
place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see
when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace
you have seen more than once bul wilh which you aren't
very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen
once, possibly using magic. "Description"
is a place
whose Iocation and appearance
you know through
someone else's description,
perhaps from a map.
"False destination"
is a place that doesn't exist.
Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum
but
instead viewed an illusion, or you are atlempting lo
teleport to a familiar localion that no longer exists.
00 Target. Vou and your group (or the target objecl)
appear where you wanllo.
OffTarget. Vou and your group (or the larget object)
appear a random dislance away from the deslination
in a random direclion. Distance off target is Id 10 x
Id lO percent of the distance that was to be traveled.
For example, if you tried to traveI 120 miles, landed off
largel, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two dlOs, lhen you
would be off largel by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM
determines
lhe direction off targel randomly by rolling a
d8 and designaling
I as north, 2 as northeast,
3 as easl,
and so on around lhe points of lhe compasso ]f you were
teleporting
lo a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out
at sea, you could be in trouble.
Similar Area. Vou and your group (or the targel
object) wind up in a different area that's visually or
themalically similar to the target area. ]f you are
heading for your home laboratory, for example, you
might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in
an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same
tools and implemenls as your laboratory. Generally,
you appear in the closest similar place, bul since the
spell has no range Iimit, you could conceivably wind up
anywhere on the plane.
Mishap. The spell's unpredictable
magic results in a
difficultjourney.
Each leleporting
crealure
(or the largel
objecl) lakes 3d 10 force damage, and lhe DM rerolls on
Creature. Vou can lry to move a Huge or smaller
crealure.
Make an abilily check wilh your spellcasting
ability contested by the crealure's
Strength
check. ]f
you win lhe contesl, you move the creature
up to 30 feet
in any direclion, including upward but not beyond the
range of lhis spel!. Until the end of your nexllurn,
the
creature
is restrained
in your telekinetic gripo A creature
Iifled upward is suspended
in mid.air.
On subsequenl
rounds, you can use your action lO
atlempl to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature
by repealing lhe contest.
Object. Vou can try to move an objecl thal weighs
up to 1,000 pounds.lfthe
object isn't being worn or
carried, you automalically
move il up lo 30 feet in any
direction, but not beyond lhe range of lhis spell.
If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must
make an ability check wilh your spellcasting
ability
contesled by lhat creature's
Strenglh
check. ]f you
succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and
can move il up to 30 feel in any direclion but nol beyond
the range of this spel!.
Vou can exert fine conlrol on objecls with your
telekinetic grip, such as manipulaling
a simple tool,
opening a door or a conlainer, stowing or relrieving
an item from an open container, or pouring the
contents from a via!'
