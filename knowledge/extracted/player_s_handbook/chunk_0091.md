SCRIPT:
SAM PLE ALPHABET
""TIKA ANO ARTEMIS: ALIGNMENT
Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted
and striving to help others where she cano Artemis is lawful
evil, unconcerned
with the value of sentient life but at least
professional in his approach to murder.
As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He
began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes
when he must-and
when it's in his own best interests. In
most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups
alongside others who don't share their interests and objectives.
Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.

PERSONAL
CHARACTERISTICS
Fleshing
out your character's
personality-the
array
Df
traits,
mannerisms,
habits,
beliefs,
and flaws that give
a person
a unique
identity-will
help you bring
him
or her to life as you play the game.
Four categories
Df
characteristics
are presented
here: personality
traits,
ideais,
bonds,
and flaws. Beyond
those
categories,
think
about your character's
favorite
words
or phrases,
tics and habitual
gestures,
vices and pet peeves,
and
whatever
else you can imagine.
Each
background
presented
later in this chapter
includes
suggested
characteristics
that you can use
to spark
your imagination.
You're not bound
to those
options,
but they're
a good starting
point.
PERSONALITY
TRAITS
Give your character
two personality
traits.
Personality
traits
are small,
simple
ways to help you set your
character
apart
from every other
character.
Your
personality
traits
should
tell you something
interesting
and fun about your character.
They should
be self.
descriptions
that are specific
about
what
makes
your
character
stand
out. "I'm smart"
is not a good trait,
because
it describes
a lot Dfcharacters.
"!'ve read every
book in Candlekeep"
tells you something
specific
about
your character's
interests
and disposition.
Personality
traits
might
describe
the things
your
character
likes,
his or her past accomplishments,
things
your character
dislikes
or fears,
your character's
sei f-
attitude
or mannerisms,
or the influence
Df his or her
ability
scores.
