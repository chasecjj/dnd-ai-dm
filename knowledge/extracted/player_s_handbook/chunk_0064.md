FAVORED ENEMY
Beginning at 1st levei, you have significant experience
studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain
type of enemy.
Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations,
beasts, celestiais, constructs,
dragons, elementals,
fey,
fiends, giants, monstrosities,
oozes, plants, or undead.
Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid
(such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
Vou have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to
track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence
checks to recall information about them.
When you gain this feature, you also learn one
language of your choice that is spoken by your favored
enemies, if they speak one at alI.
Vou choose one additional favored enemy, as well as
an associated
language, at 6th and 14th leveI. As you
gain leveis, your choices should reflect the types of
monsters you have encountered
on your adventures.
NATURAL
EXPLORER
Vou are particularly
familiar with one type of natural
environment
and are adept at traveling and surviving in
such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic,
coast, desert, forest, grassland,
mountain, swamp,
or the Underdark.
When you make an Intelligence or
Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your
proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that
you're proficient in.
While traveling for an hour or more in your favored
terrain, you gain the following benefits:
Difticult terrain doesn't slow your group's traveI.
Your group can't become lost except by magical
means.
Even when you are engaged in another activity while
traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking),
you remain alert to danger.
If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at
a normal pace.
When you forage, you find twice as much food as you
normally would.
While tracking other creatures,
you also learn their
exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they
passed through the area.
Vou choose additional favored terra in types aI 6th
and 10th leveI.
FIGHTING
STYLE
At 2nd levei, you adopt a particular
style of fighting as
your specialty. Choose one of the following options.
Vou can't take a Fighting Style option more than once,
even if you later get to choose again.
ARCHERY
Vou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with
ranged weapons.
DEFENSE
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +I bonus to AC.
DUELING
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and
no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
with that weapon.
TWO-WEAPON
FIGHTING
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add
your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
SPELLCASTING
By the time you reach 2nd levei, you have learned to
use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much
as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting
and chapter 11 for the ranger spell Iist.
SPELL SLOTS
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st leveI and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's leveI
or higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-levei spell animal
friendship and have a 1st-levei and a 2nd-leveI spell slot
available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.
SPELLS KNOWN
OF 1ST LEVE L AND HIGHER
Vou know two 1st-levei spells ofyour choice from the
ranger spelllist.
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows
when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each
of these spells must be of a levei for which you have
9'
