REACTIONS
MOVEMENT
AND POSITION
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow
you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction
is an instant response
to a trigger of some kind, which
can occur on your turn ar on someone else's. The
opportunity
attack, described
later in this chapter, is the
most common type of reaction.
When you take a reaction, you can't take another one
until the start of your next turno If the reaction interrupts
another creature's
turn, that creature can continue its
turn right after the reaction.
OTHER
ACTI VITY ON YOUR TuRN
Your turn can include a variety of f10urishes that require
neither your action nor your move.
Vou can communicate
however you are abIe, through
brief utterances
and gestures,
as you take your turno
Vou can also interact with one object ar feature of the
enviranment
for free, during either your move ar your
action. For example. you could open a doar during your
move as you stride toward a foe, ar you could draw your
weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.
If you want to interact with a second object, you need
to use your action. Some magic items and other special
objects always require an action to use, as stated
in their descriptions.
The DM might require you to use an action for any
of these activities when it needs special care ar when it
presents
an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM
could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a
stuck doar ar turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
Vou can break up your movement on your turn, using
some of your speed before and after your action. For
example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move
10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feel.
DIFFICULT
TERRAIN
Combatants
often find themselves
Iying on the ground,
either because they are knocked down ar because they
thraw themselves
down. In the game, they are prane,
a condition described
in appendix A.
Vou can drop prone without using any of your
speed. Standing
up takes more effort; doing so costs
BEING PRONE
USING
DIFFERENT
SPEEDS
If you have more than one speed, such as your walking
speed and a f1yingspeed, you can switch back and forth
between your speeds during your move. Whenever you
switch, subtract the distance you've already moved fram
the new speed. The result determines
how much farther
you can move. If the result is O ar less. you can't use the
new speed during the current move.
For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying
speed of 60 beca use a wizard cast the fly spell on you,
you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap
into the air to fly 30 feet more.
BREAKING Dp YOUR MOVE
MOVING
BETWEEN ATTACKS
If you take an action that includes more than one
weapon attack, you can break up your movement even
further by moving between those attacks. For example,
a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra
Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could
move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then
attack again.
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your
speed. Vou can use as much ar as little of your speed as
you Iike on your turn, following the rules here.
Your movement can includejumping,
c1imbing, and
swimming. These different modes of movement can
be combined with walking, ar they can constitute your
entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the
distance of each part of your move fram your speed until
it is used up ar until you are dane moving.
The "Special Types of Movement" section in
chapter 8 gives the particulars
for jumping, c1imbing,
and swimming.
Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on
featureless
plains. Boulder-strewn
caverns, briar-
choked forests, treacherous
staircases-the
setting of
a typical fight contains difficult terrain.
Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1
extra fool. This ruIe is true even if multiple things in
a space count as difficult terrain.
Low furniture, rubble, undergrawth,
steep stairs,
snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain.
The space of another creature, whether hostile or not,
also counts as difficult terrain.
