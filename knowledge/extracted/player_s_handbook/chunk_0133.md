Intimidation. When you attempt to influence someone
through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical
violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma
(Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry
information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs
to back down from a confrontation,
ar using the edge of
a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to
reconsider
a decision.
Performance. Your Charisma
(Performance)
check
determines
how well you can delight an audience with
music, dance, acting, storytelling, ar some other form of
entertainment.
Persuasion. When you attempt to influence someone
or a group of people with tact. social graces, ar good
nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma
(Persuasion)
check. Typically, you use persuasion
when
acting in good faith, to foster friendships,
make cordial
requests, ar exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of
persuading
others include convincing a chamberlain
to
let your party see the king, negotiating peace between
warring tribes, ar inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.
Other Charisma Checks. The DM might call for a
Charisma
check when you try to accomplish tasks like
the following:
Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors,
and gossip
Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics
of conversation
SPELLCASTING
ABILITY
Bards, paladins, sorcerers.
and warlocks use Charisma
as their spellcasting
ability, which helps determine
the
saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
SAVING THROWS
A saving throw-also
called a save-represents
an
attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, ar
a similar threat. Vou don't normally decide to make a
saving throw; you are forced to make one because your
character
ar monster is at risk of harm.
To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the
appropriate
ability modifier. For example, you use your
Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.
A saving throw can be modified by a situational
bonus ar penalty and can be affected byadvantage
and disadvantage,
as determined
by the DM.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving
throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient
in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies,
proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his
ar her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using
a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving
throw proficiencies as well.
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined
by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a
saving throw allowed bya spell is determined
by the
caster's spellcasting
ability and proficiency bonus.
The result of a successful
ar failed saving throw is
also detailed in the effeel that allows the save. Usually,
a successful
save means that a creature
suffers no
harm, ar reduced harm, from an effect.

CHAPTER
8: ADVENTURING
ELVING INTO THE ANCIENT TOMB or HORRORS.
slipping through the back alleys of
Waterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through
the thick jungles on the Isle of Dread-these
are the things that DUNGEONS& DRAGONS
adventures
are made of. Your character
in
the game might explore forgotten ruins and
uncharted
lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister
plots, and slay foul monsters. And if ali goes well, your
character
will survive to claim rich rewards before
embarking
on a new adventure.
This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring
life,
from the mechanics
of movement to the complexities of
social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this
chapter, along with a discussion
of the activities your
character
might pursue between adventures.
Whether adventurers
are exploring a dusty dungeon
or the complex relationships
of a royal court, the game
follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book's
introduction:
I. The DM describes
the environmenl.
2. The players describe what they want to do.
3. The DM narrates
the results of their actions.
Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the
adventure, tracking the characters'
progress as they
explore dungeon corridors or wilderness
regions.
The DM's notes, including a key to thc map, describe
what the adventurers
lind as they enter each new area.
Sometimes,
the passage of time and the adventurers'
actions determine
what happens, so the DM might
use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress
instead of a map.
TIME
In situations where keeping track of the passage of
time is important, the DM determines
the time a task
requires. The DM might use a different time scale
depending on the context of the situation at hand. In
a dungeon environment,
the adventurers'
movement
happens on a scale of minutes.
lt takes them about a
minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute
to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and
a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for
anything interesting
or valuable.
In a city or wilderness,
a scale of hours
is often more
appropriate.
Adventurers
eager to rcach the lonely tower
at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles
in just under four hours' time.
For long journeys, a scale of days works besl.
Following the road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the
adventurers
spend four uneventful days before a goblin
ambush interrupts
their journey.
In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game
relies on rounds,
a 6-second span of time described
in chapter 9.
MOVEMENT
Swimming
across a rushing river, sneaking
down a
dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-
ali sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.
The DM can summarize
the adventurers'
movement
without calculating
exact distances
or traveI times: "You
travei through the forest and find the dungeon entrance
late in the evening of the third day." Even in a dungeon,
particularlya
large dungeon or a cave network, the
DM can summarize
movement between encounters:
"After killing the guardian at the entrance
to the ancient
dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads
you through miJes of echoing corridors to a chasm
bridged bya narrow stone arch."
Sometimes
it's important,
though, to know how long
it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the
answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for
determining
traveI time depend on two factors: the
speed and traveI pace of the creatures
moving and the
terrain they're moving over.
SPEED
Every character
and monster has a speed, which is
the distance in feet that the character
or monster
can walk in 1 round. This number assumes
short
bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-
threatening
situation.
The following rules determine
how far a character
or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.
TRAVEL
PACE
While traveling, a group of adventurers
can move at a
normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travei Pace
table. The table states how far the party can move in a
period of time and whether the pace has any effecl. A
fast pace makes characters
less perceptive, while a slow
pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an
area more carefully (see the "Activity While Traveling"
section later in this chapter for more information).
Forced March. The Travei Pace table assumes
that
characters
traveI for 8 hours in day. They can push on
beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.
For each additional hour of traveI beyond 8 hours,
the characters
cover the distance shown in the Hour
column for their pace, and each character
must make
a Constitution
saving throw at the end of the hour. The
DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed
saving throw, a character
suffers one leveI of exhaustion
(see appendix A).
Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up
to an hour), many animaIs move much faster than
humanoids. A mounted character
can ride at a gallop
for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for
a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10
miles, characters
can cover larger distances
at this pace,
but this is very rare except in uensely populated areas.
