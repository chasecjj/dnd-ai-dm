on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and
evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight
additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal
damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's
reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively
small number of spells, committing
them to memory
instead of keeping them in a spellbook.
SPELLCASTING
When you reach 3rd levei, you augment your martial
prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10
for the general rules of spellcasting
and chapter 11 for
the wizard spelllist.
Cantrips. Vou learn two cantrips of your choice fram
the wizard spell list. Vou learn an additional wizard
cantrip of your choice at 10th leveI.
SpeJl Slots. The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting
table
shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
spells of 1st leveI and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's levei or
higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the Ist.level spell shieId and
have a Ist.level and a 2nd.level spell slot available, you
can cast shieId using either slot.
SpeJls Known of 1st-LeveI and Higher. Vou know
three 1st.level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
you must choose from the abjuration and evocation
spells on the wizard spelllist.
The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight
Spellcasting
table shows when you learn more wizard
spells of 1st levei or higher. Each of these spells must be
an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must
be of a leveI for which you have spell slots. For instance,
when you reach 7th levei in this c1ass, you can learn one
new spell of 1st or 2nd leveI.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th leveI can
come from any school of magic.
Whenever you gain a leveI in this c1ass, you can
replace one of the wizard spells you know with another
spell of your choice from lhe wizard spelllist.
The
new spell must be of a leveI for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell,
unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,
or 20th leveI.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting
ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your
spells through study and memorization.
Vou use your
lntelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier
when setting lhe saving throw De for a wizard spell you
cast and when making an attack roll with one.
