PORTENT
Starting at 14th levei, the visions in your dreams
intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind
of what is to come. Vou roll three d20s for your Portent
feature, rather than two.
SCHOOLOFENCHANTMENT
As a member of the School of Enchantment,
you have
honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile
other people and monsters.
Some enchanters
are
peacemakers
who bewitch the violent to lay down their
arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others
are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their
service. Most enchanters
fall somewhere
in between.
ENCHANTMENT
SAVANT
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd levei, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment
spell into your spellbook is halved.
HYPNOTIC
GAZE
Starting at 2nd levei when you choose this school, your
soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall
another creature. As an action, choose one creature that
you can see within 5 feet of you. ]f the target can see or
hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you
until the end of your next turno The charmed creature's
speed drops to O, and the creature is incapacitated
and
visibly dazed.
On subsequent
turns, you can use your action to
maintain this effect, extending its duration until the
end of your next turno However, the effect ends if you
move more than 5 feet away from the creature,
if the
creature
can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature
takes damage.
Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its
initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this
feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
INSTINCTIVE
CHARM
Beginning at 6th levei, when a creature you can see
within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against
you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack,
provided that another creature
is within the attack's
range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw
against your wizard spell save De. On a failed save,
the attacker must target the creature
that is dosest
lo il, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures
are dosest,
lhe attacker chooses which one to target.
On a successful
save, you can't use this feature on the
attacker again until you finish a long rest.
Vou must choose to use this feature before knowing
whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures
that can't
be charmed are immune to this effect.
SPLIT ENCHANTMENT
Starting at 10th levei, when you cast an enchantment
spell of 1st levei or higher that targets only one creature,
you can have it target a second creature.
ALTER MEMORIES
At 14th levei, you gain the ability to make a creature
unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast
an enchantment
spell to charm one or more creatures,
you can alter one creature's
understanding
so that it
remains unaware of being charmed.
Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can
use your action lOtry to make the chosen creature
forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature
must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against
your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours
of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma
modifier
(minimum
1).Vou can make the creature
forget less
time, and the amount of time can't exceed thc duration
of your enchantment
spell.
SCHOOL OF EVOCATION
Vou focus your study on magic that creates powerful
elemental effects sue h as bitter cold, searing flame,
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid.
Some evokers find employment in military forces,
serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar.
Others use their spectacular
power to protect the weak,
while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers,
or aspiring tyrants.
EVOCATION
SAVANT
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd levei, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell
into your spellbook is halved.
SCULPT
SPELLS

reIative safety within the effects of your evocation spclls.
When you cast an evocation spell that affects other
creatures
that you can see, you can choose a number
of them equal to 1 + the spell's leveI. The chosen
creatures
automatically
succeed on their saving throws
against the spell, and they take no damage if they would
normally take half damage on a successful
save.
POTENT
CANTRIP
Starting at 6th levei, your damaging cantrips affect
even creatures
that avoid the brunt of the effect. When
a creature
succeeds on a saving throw against your
cantrip, the creature
takes half the cantrip's damage (if
any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.
