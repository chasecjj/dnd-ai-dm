DREAM
5th-leveI iIIusion
Casting Time: I minute
Range: 5pecial
Components:
V,5, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink,
and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)
Duration:
8 hours
This spell shapes a creature's
dreams. Choose a
creature
known to you as the target of this spell. The
target must be on the same plane of existence as you.
Creatures
that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be
contacted by this spell. Vou, or a willing creature you
touch, enlers a trance state, acting as a messenger.
While in the trance, the messenger
is aware of his or
her surroundings,
but can't take actions or move.
If the target is asleep, the messenger
appears
in the
target's dreams and can converse with the target as
long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the
spell. The messenger
can also shape the environment
of the dream, creating landscapes.
objects, and other
images. The messenger
can emerge from the trance at
any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target
recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is
awake when you cast the spell, the messenger
knows it,
and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for
the target to fali asleep, at which point the messenger
appears
in the target's dreams.
Vou can make the messenger
appear monstrous
and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger
can deliver a message of no more than ten words and
then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal
monstrosity
spawn a nightmare
that lasts the duration of the target's
sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit
from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it
takes 3d6 psychic damage.
If you have a body part, lock of hair, c1ipping from a
nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target
makes its saving throw with disadvantage.
DRUIDCRAFT
Transmutation
cantrip
Casting Time: I action
Range: 30 feet
Components:
V,5
Duration:
Instantaneous
Whispering
to the spirits of nature, you create one of the

for

for I round.
Vou instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open,
or a leaf bud bloom.
Vou create an instantaneous,
harmless
sensory effect,
such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a
small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect
must fit in a 5-foot cube.
Vou instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a
small campfire.
EARTHQUAKE
8th-leveI evocation
Casting Time: I action
Range: 500 feet
Components:
V, 5, M (a pinch of dirl, a piece of rock,
and a lump of c1ay)
Duration:
Concentration,
up to I minute
Vou create a seismic disturbance
at a point on the
ground that you can see within range. For the duration,
an intense tremor rips through the ground in a
100-foot-radius circ1e centered on that point and shakes
creatures
and structures
in contact with the ground
in that area.
The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.
Each creature
on the ground that is concentrating
must
make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature's
concentration
is broken.
When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn
you spend concentrating
on it, each creature on the
ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature
is knocked prone.
This spell can have additional effects depending on
the terra in in the area, as determined
by the DM.
Fissures. Fissures open throughout
the spell's area at
the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total
of Id6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM.
Each is IdlO x 10 feet deep, la feet wide, and extends
from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side.
A creature
standing on a spot where a fissure opens
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fali in. A
creature
that sllccessfully saves moves with the fissure's
edge as it opens.
A fissure that opens beneath a structure
causes it to
automatically collapse (see below).
Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage
to any structure
in contact with the ground in the area
when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your
turns until the spell ends. ]f a structure
drops to Ohit
points, it collapses and potentially damages
nearby
creatures.
A crealure within half the distance of a
structure's
height must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning
damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble,
requiring a DC 20 Strength
(Athletics) check as an
action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher
or lower, depending
on the nalure of the rubble. On
a successful
save, the creature
takes half as much
damage and doesn't fali prone or become buried.
