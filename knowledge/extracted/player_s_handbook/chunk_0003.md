this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many
of them have been published as official settings for the
D&D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Drag-
onlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron
settings are woven together in the fabric of the multi-
verse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands
more, created by generations
of D&D players for their
own games. And amid ali the richness of the multiverse,
you might create a world of your own.
Ali these worlds share characteristics,
but each world
is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive
monsters and races, fantastic geography, anciem dun-
geons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual
traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun
setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling
cannibals,
and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature
races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron's war-
forged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in
the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great
story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role
in the Dragonlance
setting. But they're ali D&D worlds,
and you can use the rules in this book to create a char-
acter and play in any one of them.
Your DM might set the campaign on one of these
worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there
is so much diversity among the worlds of D&D, you
should check with your DM about any house rules that
will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dun-
geon Master is the authority on the campaign and its
setting, even if the setting is a published world.
USING THIS BOOK
The Player's Handbook is divided into three parts.
Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the
rules and guidance you need to make the character
you'lI play in the game. It includes information on the
various races, classes, backgrounds,
equipment, and
other customization
options that you can choose from.
Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2
and 3. If you come across a game concept in part 1 that
you don't understand,
consult the book's indexo
Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game,
beyond the basics described
in this introduction.
That
part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine
success or failure at the tasks your character
attempts,
and describes
the three broad categories of activity in
the game: exploration, interaction,
and combat.
Part 3 is ali about magic. It covers the nature of magic
in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting,
and the
huge variety of spells available to magic-using charac-
ters (and monsters) in the game.
HOWTO
PLAY
The play of the DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame unfolds
according to this basic pattern.
1. The DM describes
the environment.
The DM
tells the players where their adventurers
are and what's
around them, presenting
the basic scope of options that
present themselves (how many doors lead out of a roam,
what's on a table, who's in the tavern, and so on).
INTRODUCTION
2. The players describe
what they want to do. Some-
times one player speaks for the whole party, saying,
"We'lI take the east door," for example. Other times,
different adventurers
do different things: one adventurer
might search a treasure
chest while a second examines
an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps
watch for monsters.
The players don't need to take
turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides
how to resolve those actions.
Sometimes,
resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer
wants to walk across a roam and open a door, the DM
might just say that the door opens and describe what
lies beyond. But the doar might be locked, the floor
might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance
might make it challenging
for an adventurer
to complete
a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens,
often relying on the roll of a die to determine
the results
of an action.
3. The DM narrates
the results
ofthe
adventurers'
actions.
Describing the results often leads to another
decision point, which brings the flow of the game right
back to step 1.
This pattern holds whether the adventurers
are cau-
tiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or
locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In
certain situations, particularly
combat, the action is
more structured
and the players (and DM) do take turns
choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time,
play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances
of the adventure.
Often the action of an adventure takes place in the
imagination
of the players and DM, relying on the DM's
verbal descriptions
to set the scene. Some DMs like to
use music, art, ar recorded sound effects to help set the
mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different
voices for the various adventurers,
monsters,
and other
characters
they play in the game. Sometimes,
a DM
might lay out a map and use tokens ar miniature
figures
to represent
each creature
involved in a scene to help
the players keep track of where everyone is.
GAME DrCE
The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers
of sides. Vou can find dice like these in game stores and
in many bookstores.
In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the
letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, dS, dI O,
d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the
typical cube that many games use).
Percentile dice, ar d100, work a little differently. Vou
generate a number between
1 and 100 by rolling two
different ten-sided dice numbered
from Oto 9. One die
(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and
the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for
example, the number rolled is 71. Two Os represent
100.
Some ten-sided dice are numbered
in tens (00, 10, 20,
and so on), making it easier to distinguish
the tens digit
from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and I is 71,
and 00 and Ois 100.
When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how
many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what mod-
ifiers to add. For example, "3dS + 5" means you roll
