SPELL SLOTS
The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your spells of 1st levei and higher. To cast one of
these spells. you must expend a slot of the spell's levei
ar higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long resl.
For example. if you know the 1st-levei spell cure
wounds and have a 1st-levei and a 2nd-levei spell slot
available, you ean cast cure wounds using either slol.
SPELLS KNOWN
OF 1ST LEVEL AND H IGHER
Vou know four 1st-levei spells of your choice from the
bard spelllist.
The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows
when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of
these spells must be of a levei for which you have spell
slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you
reach 3rd leveI in this c1ass, you can learn one new spell
of 1st ar 2nd leveI.
Additionally, when you gain a levei in this c1ass, you
can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace
il wilh anolher spell from the bard spelllist,
which also
must be of a levei for which you have spell slots.
SPELLCASTING
ABILITY
Charisma
is your spellcasting
ability for your bard
spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you
pau r into the performance
of your music ar oration.
Vou use your Charisma
whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC ~ 8 + your proficiency
bonus
+
your Charisma
modifier
Spell attack

+
your Charisma
modifier
RITUAL
CASTING
Vou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that
spell has the ritual tag.
SPELLCASTING
Focus
Vou can use a musical instrument
(found in chapter 5)
as a spellcasting
focus for your bard spells.
BARDIC INSPIRATION
Vou can inspire others through stirring words or musico
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose
one creature
other than yourselfwithin
60 feet ofyou
who can hear YOU. That creature
gains one Bardic
lnspiration
die, a d6.
Once within the next 10 minutes, lhe crealure can roll
the die and add the number rolled to one ability check,
attack roll, ar saving throw it makes. The creature can
wait until after it rolls lhe d20 before deciding to use the
Bardic Inspiration
die, but must decide hefore the DM
says whether the roll succeeds
ar fails. Once the Bardic
Inspiration
die is rolled. it is losl. A creature
can have
only one Bardic Inspiration
die at a time.
