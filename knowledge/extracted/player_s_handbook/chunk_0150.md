LINE
Aline
extends
from its point of origin
in a straight
path
up to its length
and covers
an area
defined
by its width.
A line's
point of origin
is not included
in the line's
area
of effect, unless
you decide
otherwise.
SPHERE
Vou select
a sphere's
point of origin,
and the sphere
extends
outward
from that point. The sphere's
size is expressed
as a radius
in feet that extends
from the point.
A sphere's
point of origin
is included
in the sphere's
area
of effect.
SAVING THROWS
Many spells
specify
that a target
can make
a saving
throw
to avoid some
or ali of a spell's
effects.
The spell
specifies
the ability
that the target
uses
for the save and
what
happens
on a success
or failure.
The De to resist
one of your spells
equals
8 + your
spellcasting
ability modifier
+ your proficiency
bonus
+
any special
modifiers.
ATTACK
ROLLS
Some
spells
require
the caster
to make
an attack
roll
to determine
whether
the spell effect hits the intended
target.
Your attack
bonus
with a spell attack
equals
your
spellcasting
ability
modifier
+ your proficiency
bonus.
Most spells
that require
attack
rolls involve ranged
attacks.
Remember
that you have disadvantage
on a
ranged
attack
roll if you are within
5 feet of a hostile
creature
that can see you and that isn't incapacitated
(see chapter
9).
COMBINING
MAGICAL EFFECTS
The effects
of different
spells
add together
while
the durations
of those
spells
overlap.
The effects
of
the same
spell cast multi pie times
don't combine,
however.
lnstead,
the most potent
effect-such
as the
highest
bonus-from
those
castings
applies
while
their
durations
overlap.
For example,
if two clerics
cast bless on the same
target,
that character
gains
the spell's
benefit
only
once; he or she doesn't
get to roll two bonus
dice.

WEAVE OF MAGIC
lhe worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical places.
Aliexistence is suffused with magical power, and potential
energy lies untapped
in every rock, stream, and living
creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of
creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating
every bit of malter and present in every manifestation
of
energy throughout
the multiverse.
Mortais can't directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they
make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between
the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. lhe
spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and
recagnize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters
have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. Sy
any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and
inaccessible;the
most powerful archmage can't light a candle
with magic in an area where the Weave has been tom. Sut
surrounded
by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning
to blast foes, transport
hundreds of miles in the blink of an
eye, or even reverse death itself.
Ali magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds
of magic access it in a variety of ways. lhe spells of wizards,
warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane
magic. lhese
spells rely on an understanding-Iearned
or
intuitive-of
the workings of the Weave. lhe caster plucks
directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired
effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane
magic. lhe spells of derics, druids, paladins, and rangers are
called divine magic. lhese
spellcasters'
access to the Weave
is mediated by divine power-gods,
the divine forces of
nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin's oath.
Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the
Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible.
When characters use divination spells such as detect magic or
identify, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as dispel magic
smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic field rearrange
the Weave 50 that magic fiows around, rather than through,
the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave
is damaged or tom, magic works in unpredictable ways-or
not at alI.
