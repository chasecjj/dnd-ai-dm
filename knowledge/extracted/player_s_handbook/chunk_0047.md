LAND'S
STRIDE
Starting at 6th levei, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. Vou can
also pass through nonmagical
plants without being
slowed by them and without taking damage from them if
they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against
plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede
movement, such those created by the entangle spell.
PRIMAL
STRIKE
Starting at 6th levei, your attacks in beast form eount as
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance
and
immunity to nonmagieal
attaeks and damage.
ELEMENTAL
WILD
SHAPE
At 10th levei, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape
at the same time to transform
into an air elemental, an
earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.
THOUSAND
FORMS
By 14th levei, you have learned to use magie to alter
your physical form in more subtle ways. Vou can cast the
alter self spell at will.
DRUIOS
ANO
THE COOS
Some druids venerate
the forces of nature
themselves,
but
most druids
are devoted
to one of the many nature deities
worshiped
in the multiverse
(the Iists of gods in appendix
B inelude
many such deities).
The worship
ofthese
deities
is often considered
a more ancient
tradition
than the faiths
of elerics and urbanized
peoples.
In fact, in the world of
Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it
elaims many adherents
among
farmers,
foresters,
fishers,
and others
who live elosely with nature.
This tradition
ineludes
the worship
of Nature as a primai force beyond
personification,
but also encompasses
the worship
of Beory,
the Oerth
Mother, as well as devotees
ofObad.Hai,
Ehlonna,
and Ulaa.
In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten
Realms,
druidic cireles are not usually connected
to the faith of a
single nature
deity. Any given cirele in the Forgotten
Realms,
for example,
might inelude druids
who revere Silvanus,
Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea,
or even the harsh Gods of Fury:
Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee.
These nature
gods are
often called the First Cirele, the first among
the druids,
and
most druids
count them ali (even the violent ones)
as worthy
af veneration.
The druids
of Eberron hold animistic
beliefs completely
unconnected
to the Sovereign
Host, the Dark Six, or any of
the other religions
of the world. They believe that every living
thing and every natural
phenomenon-sun,
moon,
wind,
fire, and the world itself-has
a spiri!. Their spells, then, are
a means to communicate with and command these spirits.
Different druidic
sects, though,
hold different
philosophies
about the pro per relationship
of these
spirits to each other
and to the forces of civilization.
The Ashbound,
for example,
believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature,
the Children ofWinter
venerate
the forces of death,
and the
Gatekeepers
preserve
ancient
traditions
meant
to protect
the
world from the incursion
of aberrations.
NATURE'S
WARD
When you reach 10th levei, you can't be charmed or
frightened by elementals
or fey,and you are immune to
poison and disease.
NATURE'S
SANCTUARY
When you reach 14th levei, creatures
of the natural
world sense your connection
to nature and become
hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature
attacks you, that creature
must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save,
the creature
must choose a different target, or the attack
automatically
misses. On a successful
save, the creature
is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
The creature
is aware of this effect before it makes its
attack against you.
CIRCLE
OF THE MOON
Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians
of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to
share news and trade warnings. They haunt thc deepest
parts of the wilderness,
where they might go for weeks
on end before crossing paths with another humanoid
creature,
let alone another druid.
Changeable
as the moon, a druid of this circle might
prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops
as an eagle the next day, and crash through the
undergrowth
in bear form to drive off a trespassing
monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.
COMBAT WILD
SHAPE
When you choose this circle at 2nd levei, you gain the
ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action,
rather than as an action.
Additionally, while you are transformed
by Wild
Shape. you can use a bonus action to expend one
spell slot to regain ld8 hit points per levei of the spell
slot expended.
CIRCLE
FORMS
The rites ofyour circle grant you the ability to transform
into more dangerous
animal forms. Starting at 2nd
levei, you can use your Wild Shape to transform
into a
beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore
the Max. CR eolumn of the Beast Shapes table, but must
abide by the other limitations there).
Starting at 6th levei, you can transform
into a beast
with a challenge rating as high as your druid leveI
divided by 3, rounded down.
