INSPIRATION
Inspiration
is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to
reward you for playing your character
in a way that's
true to his or her personality
traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.
By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality
trait of compassion
for the downtrodden
to give you
an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or
inspiration
can let you calI on your bond to the defense
of your home village to push past the effect of a spelI
that has been laid on you.
GAINING
INSPIRATION
Your DM can choose to give you inspiration
for a variety
of reasons. TypicalIy, DMs award it when you play
out your personality
traits, give in to the drawbacks
presented
by a flaw or bond, and otherwise
portray your
character
in a compelIing way. Your DM wilI telI you
how you can earn inspiration in the game.
Vou either have inspiration or you don't-you
can't
stockpile multi pie "inspirations"
for later use.
USING
INSPIRATION
lf you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make
an attack rolI, saving throw, or ability check. Spending
your inspiration gives you advantage on that rol!.
AdditionalIy, if you have inspiration, you can reward
another player for good roleplaying, e1ever thinking,
or simply doing something
exciting in the game.
When another player characler
does somelhing that
realIy contributes
to the story in a fun and interesting
way, you can give up your inspiration
to give lhat
characler
inspiration.
BACKGROUNDS
Every story has a beginning. Your character's
background
reveals where you carne from, how you
beca me an adventurer, and your place in the world.
Your tighter might have been a courageous
knight or a
grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or
an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild
thief or commanded
audiences
as a jester.
Choosing a background
provides you with important
story cues about your character's
identity. The most
important
question to ask about your background
is
what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your
background
describes
and start adventuring?
Where
did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or,
if you come from a wealthy background,
why don't you
have more money? How did you learn the skills of your
e1ass? What sets you apart from ordinary people who
share your background?

both concrete benetits (features, proticiencies, and
languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

gives a character
proticiency in two
skills. SkilIs are described
in chapter 7.
In addition, most backgrounds
give a character
proticiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool
proticiencies are detailed in chapter 5.
If a character
would gain the same proticiency from
two different sources, he or she can choose a different
proticiency of the same kind (skilI or tool) instead.

to learn
additional languages
beyond those given by race.

equipmcnt. lf you use the optional rule from chapter 5
to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting
equipment from your background.

CHARACTERISTICS

characleristics
