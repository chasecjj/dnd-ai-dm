Her fists a blur as lhey detlect an incoming hail of arrows,
a half-elf springs over a barrieade
and lhrows herself
into lhe massed ranks of hobgoblins on lhe olher side.
She whirls among lhem. knocking lheir blows aside and
sending them reeling. unlil allasl
she slands alone.
Taking a deep breath. a human eovered in tattoos
seltles inlo a battle stanee. As lhe tirsl eharging ores
reaeh him. he exhales and a blasl of tire roars from his
moulh, engulting his foes.
Moving wilh lhe silenee of lhe nighl, a blaek-c1ad
halfling sleps inlo a shadow benealh an areh and
emerges from anolher inky shadow on a balcony a
stone's lhrow away. She slides her blade free of ils c1oth-
wrapped seabbard
and peers lhrough lhe open window

lheir bodies. Whelher ehanneled
as a slriking display
of eombal prowess or a subI ler foeus of defensive abilily
and speed, lhis energy infuses alllhal

Self
emerging only lo serve as spies or assassins
ai the
command of lheir leader, a noble palron, or some other
morlal or divine power.
The majorily of monks don'l shun Iheir neighbors,
making frequenl visilS lOnearhy lowns or villages and
exchanging Iheir servicc for food and other goods. As
versalile warriors,
monks oflen end up prolecting their
neighbors fram monsters or Iyranls.
For a monk, bccoming an advenlllrer
means leaving
a struelured,
communallift'slyle
lo beco me a wanderer.
This can be a harsh transition,
and monks don't
undertake
illightly. Those who leave their cloisters take
their work seriollsly, approaching
Iheir adventures
as
personal tesls of Iheir physical and spiritual growth.
As a rule, monks care lillle for material wealth and are
driven by a desire lo aceomplish a grealer mission than
merely slaying monsters and plundering Iheir treasure.
CREATING
A MONK
As you make your monk characler, Ihink about your

your parents promise YOlllo the monastery
in gratitude
for a service performed
by lhe lllonks? Did you enler
Ihis secluded life lo hide from a crime you committed?
Or did you choosc the monaslic life for yourself?
Consider why you lefl. Did lhe head of your monastery
choose you for a parliclllarly imporlant
mission beyond
the cloisler? Perhaps you \Vere casl out because of
some violalion of lhe communily's
rules. Did you dread
leaving, or were you happy lo go? ls Ihere somelhing
you hope lo accomplish oulside lhe monastery? Are you
eager lo relum
to your home?
As a result of the structured
life of a monastic
community and the discipline required lOhamess
ki,
monks are almosl always lawful in alignmenl.
