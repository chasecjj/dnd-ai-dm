60
As an action, choose one creature
that you can see
within 60 feet of you. That creature
must make a
Wisdom saving throw. If the creature
succeeds on the
saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until
you finish a long resl.
If the creature
fails its save, you can read its surface
thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its
current emotions and what it is actively thinking
about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts
for I minute.
During that time, you can use your action to end this
effect and cast the suggestion spell on the creature
without expending a spell si01. The target automatically
fails its saving throw against the spell.

must maintain concentration
during that time, as if you
were casting a spe11.

you can see visions of the object's previous owner.
After meditating for I minute, you learn how the owner
acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent
significant event involving the object and that owner.
If the object was owned by another creature
in the
recent past (within a number of days equal to your
Wisdom score), you can spend I additional minute
for each owner to learn the same information about
that creature.
Area Reading. As you meditate, you see visions
of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room,
street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube),
going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom
score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about
one significant event, beginning with the most recenl.
Significant events typically involve powerful emotions,
such as battles and betrayals, marriages
and murders,
births and funerais. However, they might also include
more mundane events that are nevertheless
important
in your current situation.
