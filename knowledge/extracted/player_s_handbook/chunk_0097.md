DEMAND
Vou can always find a place to perform, usually in an
inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or
even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free
lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard
(depending on the quality of the establishment),
as
long as you perform each night. In addition, your
performance
makes you something
of a local figure.
When strangers
recognize you in a town where you have
performed, they typically take a liking to you.
