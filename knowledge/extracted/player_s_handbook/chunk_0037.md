SPELLCASTING
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting
and
chapter 11 for the cleric spelllist.
CANTRIPS
At 1st levei, you know three cantrips of your choice from
the cleric spelllist.
Vou learn additional cleric cantrips
of your choice at higher leveis, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Cleric table.
PREPARING
AND CASTING
SPELLS
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st levei and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's levei
or higher. Vou regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
Vou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spelllist.
When
you do 50, choose a number of cleric spells equal to
your Wisdom modifier + your cleric levei (minimum of
one spell). The spells must be of a leveI for which you
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-Ievel c1eric, you have four
1st-levei and two 2nd-levei spell slots. With a Wisdom
of 16, your list of prepared
spells can include six spells
of 1st or 2nd levei, in any combination.
]f you prepare
the 1st-levei spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-levei or 2nd-levei slot. Casting the spell doesn't
remove it from your list of prepared
spells.
PART
1 I CLASSES
Vou can change your list of prepared
spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing
a new list of cleric spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spelllevel
for each spell on your listo
SPELLCASTING
ABILITY
Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your cleric spells.
The power of your spells comes from your devotion to
your deity. Vou use your Wisdom whenever a c1eric spell
refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use
your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

RITUAL
CASTING
Vou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
SPELLCASTING
Focus
Vou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting
focus for your cleric spells.
DIVINE
DOMAIN
Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each
domain is detailed at the end of the class description,
and each one provides examples of gods associated
with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and olher
features when you choose it at 1st leveI. It also grants
you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you
gain that feature at 2nd levei, and additional benefits at
6th, 8th, and 17th leveis.
DOMAIN
SPELLS
Each domain has a list of spells-its
domain spells-
that you gain at the c1eric leveis noted in the domain
description.
Once you gain a domain spell, you always
have it prepared,
and it doesn't count against the
number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the
cleric spelllist, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for YOU.
CHANNEL
DIVINITY
At 2nd levei, you gain the ability to channel divine
energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel
magical effects. Vou start with two such effects: Turn
Undead and an effect determined
by your domain. Some
domains grant you additional effects as you advance in
leveis, as noted in the domain description.
When you use your Channel Divinity. you choose
which effect to create. Vou must then finish a short or
long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
When you use such an effect from this class, the DC
equals your c1eric spell save DC.
Beginning at 6th leveI, you can use your Channel
Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th levei,
