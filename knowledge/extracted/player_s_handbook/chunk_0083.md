EQUIPMENT
Vou start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your baekground:
(a) a quarterstaff
or (b) a dagger
(a) a eomponent poueh or (b) an areane foeus
(a) a seholar's paek or (b) an explorer's paek
A spellbook
SPELLCASTING
As a student of areane magic, you have a spellbook
eontaining
spells that show the first glimmerings
of
your true power, See ehapter 10 for the general rules of
spelleasting
and ehapter 11 for the wizard spelllist.
CANTRIPS
At 1st leveI, you know three eantrips of your ehoice
from the wizard spelllist.
Vou learn additional wizard
eantrips ofyour ehoice at higher leveIs, as shown in the
Cantrips Known eolumn of the Wizard table,

YOUR
SPELLBOOK
The spells that Vou add to your spellbook
as Vou gain leveis
refiect the arcane
research
Vou conduct
on your own, as well
as intellectual
breakthroughs
Vou have had about the nature
ofthe
multiverse.
You might find other spells during your
adventures.
You could discover
a spell recorded
on a scroll in
an evil wizard's
chest, for example,
or in a dusty tome in an
ancient
library.
Copy;ng a Spell ;nlo lhe Book. When Vou find a wizard spell
of 1st levei or higher, Vou can add it to your spellbook
if it is
of a levei for which Vou have spell slots and if Vou can spare
the time to decipher
and copy il.
Copying a spell into your spellbook
involves reproducing
the basic form of the spell, then deciphering
the unique
system
of notation
used by the wizard who wrote il. You
must practice the spell until Vou understand
the sounds
or gestures
required,
then transcribe
it into your spellbook
using your own notation.
For each levei of the spell, the process
takes 2 hours and
costs
50 gp. The cost represents
material
components
Vou
expend
as Vou experiment
with the spell to master
it, as well
as the fine inks Vou need to record il. Once Vou have spent
this time and money, Vou can prepare
the spell just like your
other spells.
Replacing lhe Book. You can copy a spell from your own
spellbook
into another
book-for
example,
if Vou want
to make a backup copy of your spellbook.
This is just like
copying a new spell into your spellbook,
but faster and easier,
since Vou understand
your own notation
and already know
how to cast the spell. You need spend
only 1 hour and 10 gp
for each levei of the copied
spell.
If Vou lose your spellbook,
Vou can use the same
procedure
to transcribe
the spells that Vou have prepared
into a new
spellbook.
Filling out the remainder
of your spellbook
requires
Vou to find new spells to do so, as normal.
For this
reason,
many wizards
keep backup spellbooks
in a safe place.
The Book's Appea,ance.
Your spellbook
is a unique
compilation af spells, with its own decorative f10urishes and
margin
notes.
It might be a plain, functionalleather
volume
that Vou received as a gift from your master,
a finely bound
gilt-edged
tome Vou found in an ancient
library, or even a
loose collection
of notes scrounged
together
afler Vou lost
your previous
spellbook
in a mishap.

PART
I I CLASSES
SPELLBOOK
At 1st leveI. you have a spellbook eontaining six 1st-levei
wizard spells of your ehoice.
PREPARING
ANO CASTING
SPELLS
The Wizard lable shows how many spell slots you have
to east your spells of 1st leveI and higher. To east one of
these spells, you must expend a slol of the spelJ's leveI
or higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
Vou prepare the Iist of wizard spells that are available
for you to east. To do so, ehoose a number of wizard
spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligenee
modifier + your wizard leveI (minimum of one spell). The
spells must be of a leveI for whieh you have spell slots.
For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have
four 1st-leve! and two 2nd-levei spell slots. With an
lntelligenee of 16, your list of prepared spells ean
include six spells of 1st or 2nd leveI, in any eombination,
ehosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-levei
spell magie missiJe, you ean east it using a 1st-Ievel or a
2nd-levei slot. Casting lhe spell doesn't remove it from
your Iist of prepared
spells.
Vou ean ehange your list of prepared
spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing
a new list of wizard
spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and
memorizing
the ineantations
and gestures you must
make to east the spell: aI least 1 minute per spelllevel
for eaeh spell on your Iist.
SPELLCASTING
ABILITY
lntelligenee is your spelleasting
abilily for your wizard
spells, sinee you learn your spells through dedieated
study and memorization.
Vou use your Intelligenee
whenever a spell refers to your spel1casting ability.
In addition, you use your Inlelligenee modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you east
and when making an attaek roll with one.
Spell save De = 8 + your proficiency

Vou ean east a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has
the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook.

spelleasting
foeus for your wizard spells.
