an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the

of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey,
or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
Your familiar acts independently
of you, but it always
obeys your commands.

initiative and acts on its own turno A familiar can't
attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
When the familiar drops to Ohit points, it disappears,
leaving behind no physical formo It reappears
after you
cast this spell again
While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you
can communicate
with it telepathically. Additionally,
as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes
and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
gaining the benefits of any special senses that the
familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind
with regard to your own senses.
As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your
familiar. It disappears

awaits your summons.

forever. As an action while it is temporarily

instead cause it to adopt a new formo Choose one of the
forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms
into
the chosen creature.
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch,
your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the
spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and
it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast
it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack
modifier for the roll.
