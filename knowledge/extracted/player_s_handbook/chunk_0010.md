BUILDING
BRUENOR,
STEP 5
Bob writes down the starting equipment from the
fighter c1ass and the folk hero background.
His starting
equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which
combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.
For Bruenor's weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe
and two handaxes.
His battleaxe is a melee weapon,
so Bruenor uses his Strength
modifier for his attacks
and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength
modifier
(+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5.
The battleaxe deals ld8 slashing damage, and Bruenor
adds his Strength
modifier to the damage when he
hits, for a total of ld8 + 3 slashing damage. When
throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the same attack bonus
(handaxes,
as thrown weapons, use Strength
for attacks
and damage), and the weapon deals ld6 + 3 slashing
damage when it hits.
6. COME TOGETHER
Most 0&0 characters
don't work alone. Each character
plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers
working together for a common purpose. Teamwork
and cooperation
greatly improve your party's chances
to survive the many perils in lhe worlds of OUNGEONS
& ORAGONS.TaIk to your fellow players and your OM
lo decide whether your characlers
know one another,
how they mel, and what sorls of quesls lhe group
might undertake.
BEYOND
1ST LEVEL
As your characler
goes on adventures
and overcomes
challenges,
he or she gains experience,
represenled
by
experience
poinls. A character
who reaches a specified
experience
poinl tolal advances in capabilily. This
advancemenl
is called gaining a leveI.
When your characler
gains a leveI, his or her c1ass
often granls addilional features, as delailed in the
c1ass description.
Some of these fealures allow you
lo increase your abilily scores, eilher increasing
lwo
scores by I each or increasing
one score by 2. You can't
increase an ability score above 20. In addilion, every
characler's
proficiency bonus increases
at certain leveIs.
Each time you gain a leveI, you gain I additional Hit
Oie. Roll lhal Hit Oie, add your Conslitulion modifier
to lhe roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum.
Alternatively, you can use lhe fixed value shown in your
c1ass enlry, which is the average resull of lhe die roll
(rounded up).
When your Conslilution modifier increases
by I, your
hit poinl maximum increases
by I for each leve! you have
allained. For exampIe, when Bruenor reaches 81h leveI
as a fighter, he increases
his Conslilution score from 17
to 18, lhus increasing his Conslilulion modifier from +3
to +4. His hil point maximum lhen increases
by 8.
The Character Advancement
lable summarizes
the
XP you need to advance in leveIs from leveI 1 lhrough
leveI 20, and lhe proficiency bonus for a characler
of thal
leveI. Consull the informalion
in your character's
c1ass
description
to see what olher improvements
you gain
at each leveI.
TIERS OF PLAY
The shading in the Character Advancement (able shows
lhe four tiers of play. The tiers don't have any rules
associated wilh them; they are a general descriplion of how
the play experience changes as characters gain leveIs.
In lhe first lier (leveIs 1-4), characters
are effeclively
apprentice
adventurers.
They are learning lhe features
that define lhem as members of parlicular
classes,
including lhe major choices that flavor their c1ass
features as lhey advance (such as a wizard's Arcane
Tradition or a fighter's Marlial Archetype). The threats
they face are re!ative!y minor, usually posing a nanger lo
local farmsleads
or villages.
In the second tier (leveIs 5-10), characlers
come into
lheir own. Many spellcaslers
gain access to 3rd-Ievel
spells aI lhe start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of
magical power with spells such as fireball and lightning
bolt. At lhis lier, many weapon-using
classes gain the
abilily lOmake mulliple attacks in one round. These
charac(ers
have become imporlanl, facing dangers thal
lhrealen cities and kingdoms.
In the third lier (leveIs 11-16), characlers
have
reached a leveI of power that seIs lhem high ahove
the ordinary populace and makes them special even
among advenlurers.
At 11th leveI, many spellcasters
gain access lo 6th-leveI spells, some of which create
effects previously impossible for player characters
to
achieve. Olher characters
gain fealures (hat allow (hem
lo make more attacks or do more impressive
things with
those attacks. These mighty adventurers
oflen confront
threals to whole regions and conlinents.
AI lhe fourth tier (leveIs 17-20), characters
achieve
the pinnacle of lheir c1ass features, becoming heroic (or
villainous) archetypes
in lheir own right. The fate of the
world or even lhe fundamental
order of lhe multiverse
might hang in the balance during their adventures.
