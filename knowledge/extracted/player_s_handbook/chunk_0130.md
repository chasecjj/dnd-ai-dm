For example, if a characler
attempts lo climb up a
dangerous
cliff, lhe Dungeon Masler mighl ask for a
Slrenglh
(Alhlelics) check. lf lhe characler
is proficienl
in Athletics, the characler's
proficiency bonus is added
to lhe Slrenglh
check. lf lhe characler
lacks that
proficicncy, he or she JUSlmakes a Slrenglh
check.
VARIANT:
SKILLS WITH DIFFERENT
ABILITIES
Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only lo a
specific kind of abilily check. Proficiency in Alhlelics,
for example, usually applics lo Slrenglh
checks. In some
situations,
lhough, your proficiency mighl reasonably
apply lo a differenl kind of check. In such cases, lhe DM
mighl ask for a check using an unusual combinalion
of
abilily and skill, or you mighl ask your DM if you can
applya proficiency to a differenl check. For example,
if you have lo swim from an offshore island to lhe
mainland, your DM mighl call for a Conslilulion
check
lo see if you have the stamina lo make it that faroIn lhis
case, your DM mighl allow you to apply your proficiency
in Alhlelics and ask for a Constilulion
(Alhlelics) check.
So ifyou're proficienl in Alhlelics, you apply your
proficiency honus to lhe Conslilulion
checkjusl
as you
would normally do for a Slrenglh
(Alhlelics) check.
SimilarIy, when your half-orc barbarian
uses a display
of raw slrenglh
to inlimidale an enemy, your DM mighl
ask for a Strength
(Inlimidalion)
check, evenlhough
Intimidalion
is normally associaled
wilh Charisma.
PASSIVE CHECKS
A passive check is a special kind of abilily check lhal
doesn'l involve any die rolls. Such a check can represenl
lhe average resull for a task done repealedly, such as
searching
for secrel doors over and over again. or can
be used when the DM wanls lo secretly determine
whelher lhe characters
succeed at something wilholll
rolling dice, such as nOlicing a hidden monsler.
Here's how lo delermine
a character's
lolal for a
passive check:
10 + ali modifiers
thal
normally
apply to the check
If the characler
has advanlage on lhe check, add 5. For
disadvanlage,
suhlract 5. The game refers lo a passive
check lotai as a score.
For example. if a 1st-levei character
has a Wisdom of
15 and proficiency in Perceplion.
he or she has a passive
Wisdom (Perceplion) score of 14.
The rules on hiding in lhe "Dexlerily" section below
rely on passive cbecks, as do lhe exploralion rules
in chapler 8.
WORKING
TOGETHER
Some times lwo or more characlers
leam up to allempt a
lask. The characler
who's leading lhe effort-or
lhe one
wilb lhe highesl abilily modifier-can
make an ability
cbeck wilh advanlage, reflecling the help provided by
the olher characlers.
In combal, lhis requires lhe Help
aclion (see chapler 9).
A character can only provide help if lhe lask is one lhat
he or she cOllld allempt alone. For example, trying lo
open a lock requires proficiency wilh lhieves' lools, so a
characler who lacks lhat proficiency can't help anolher
characler in lhal task. Moreover, a character can help
only when two or more individuais working logelher
would aclually be produclive. Some lasks, such as
lbreading a needle. are no easier with help.
GROUP CHECKS
When a number of individuais are lrying to accomplish
somelhing as a group, lhe DM mighl ask for a group
abilily check. In such a situalion, lhe characters
who are
skilled ai a parlicular
task help cover those who aren'l.
To make a group ability check. everyone in lbe group
makes lbe abilily check. lf alleasl
half lhe group
sllcceeds, the wbole group succeeds. Otherwise,
lhe group fails.
Group checks don't come up very often. and lhey're
most useful wben ali lhe characlers
succeed or
fail as a group. For example, when advenlurcrs
arc
navigating a swamp, lbe DM mighl call for a group
Wisdom (Survival) check lo see if lhe characlers
can
avoid lhe quicksand, sinkholcs,
and other natural
hazards of lhe environmenl.
If at least half the group
succeeds, lhe successful
characlers
are ablc to guide
lhcir companions
oul of danger. Olherwise,
lhe group
slumbles inlo one of lhese hazards.
USING EACH ABILITY
Every lask lhal a characler
or monsler mighl atlempt
in the game is covered by one of lhe six abililies. This
seclion explains in more delail wbal lhose abilities
mean and the ways lhey are used in lhe game.
STRENGTH
Slrenglh
measures
bodily power, athlelic training, and
the exlenllo
which you can exert raw physical force.
STRENGTH
CHECKS
A Slrenglh
check can model any atlempllo
lifl, p"sh,
pull, or break something,
lo force your body lhrougb a
space, or lo otherwise
apply brute force lo a silualion.
The Alhlelics skill reflecls aptitude in cerlain kinds of
Slrength
checks.
Athletics. Your Strenglh
(Alhlelics) check covers
difficult situations YOllencollnler while c1imbing,
jumping. or swimming. Examples include tbe
following aclivilies:
You attempt lo climh a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid
hazards while scaling a wall, or cling lo a surface
while something
is lrying to knock you off.
You try lo jump an unuslIally long distance or pull
off a slunl midjump.
You slruggle lo swim or slay afloal in lreacherous
cur-
renls, slorm-lossed
waves, or areas of lhick seaweed.
Or anolher crealure
lries lo push or pull you underwa-
ler or olherwise
interfere with your swimming.
Other Strength Checks. The DM mighl also call for
a Slrcngtb
check when you lry to accomplish
tasks like
