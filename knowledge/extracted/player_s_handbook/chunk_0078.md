Your pact weapon disappears
if it is more than 5 feet
away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears
if you use this feature again. if you dismiss the weapon
(no action required), or if you die,
Vou can transform
one magic weapon into your pact
weapon by performing
a special ritual while you hold
the weapon. Vou perform the ritual over the course
of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
Vou can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an
extradimensional
space, and it appears whenever you
create your pact weapon thereafter. Vou can't affect an
artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon
ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform
the l.hour ritual on a different weapon, or ifyou use
a l.hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon
appears
at your feet if it is in the extradimensional
space
when the bond breaks.
PACT OF THE TOME
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of
Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three
cantrips from any class's spelllist.
While the book is on
your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They
don't count against your number of cantrips known.
[f you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform
a l.hour ceremony to receive a replacement
from your
patrono This ceremony can be performed
during a short
or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book
turns to ash when you die.
ABILITY
SCORE IMPROVEMENT
When you reach 4th leveI. and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th leveI, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
MYSTIC ARCANUM
At 11th levei, your patron bestows upon you a magical
secret called an arca num. Choose one 6th-leveI spell
from the warlock spelllist
as this arcanum.
Vou can cast your arca num spell once without
expending a spell slot. Vou must finish a long rest before
you can do so again.
At higher leveIs, you gain more warlock spells of your
choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th.level spell
at 13th leveI, one 8th.level spell at 15th levei, and one
9th-leveI spell at 17th leveI. Vou regain all uses of your
Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
ELDRITCH
MASTER
At 20th leveI, you can draw on your inner reserve of
mystical power while entreating
your patron to regain
expended spell slots. Vou can spend 1 minute entreating
your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots
from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots
with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you
can do so again.

OTHERWORLDLY
PATRONS
The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are
mighty inhabitants
of other planes of existence-not
gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons
give their warlocks access to different powers and
invocations, and expect significant favors in returno
Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic
knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability
to bind mortaIs to their will. Other patrons bestow their
power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with
only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron
might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivaIs.
THEARCHFEY
Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature
of
legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before
the mortal races were born. This being's motivations
are often inscrutable,
and sometimes
whimsical, and
might involve a striving for greater magical power or the
settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include
the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness,
ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer
Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam,
the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.
