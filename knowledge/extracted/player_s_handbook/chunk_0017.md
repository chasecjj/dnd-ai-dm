The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings'
lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from
marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing tire
and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation.
Though some halflings live out their days in remote .
agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands
that travei constantly, lured by the open road and the
wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and
peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food,
hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon
jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
SMALL ANO PRACTICAL
The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger
creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding
offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear re1atively
harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries
in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and
political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing
between 40 and 45 pounds.
Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy
cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown
and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men
often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among
them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear
simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring
bright colors.
Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing.
They're concerned with basic needs and simple
pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the
wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a
cellar rather than on display for ali to see. They have
a knack for finding the most straightforward
solution
to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.
KINO
ANO CURIOUS
Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They
cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well
as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few
dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among
them usually venture into the world for reasons of


--- Page 28 ---

community, friendship, wanderlust,
ar curiosity. They
lave discovering
new things, even sim pie things, such
as an exotic food ar an unfamiliar
style of c1othing.
Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any
living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing
what they have even in lean times.
AFFABLE
AN D POSITIVE
Halflings lry lo gel along wilh everyone else and are loalh lo
make sweeping generalizalions-especially
negative ones.
Dwarves. "Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can counl
on lhem lo keep lheir word. Bul would il hurt lhem lo smile
once in a whilel"
Elves. "They're 50 beauliful! Their faces, lheir music, lheir
grace and alI. 11'5 like they slepped oul of a wonderful dream.
Bul lhere's no lelling what's going on behind lheir smiling
faces-surely

Humans.
"Humans

farmers and herders and you'll find good, solid folk. Nol lhal
lhere's anylhing wrong wilh lhe barons and soldiers-you
have lo admire lheir conviclion. And by prolecling lheir own
lands, lhey prolecl us as well."
A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly
a nickname. Family names are often nicknames
that
stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down
through the generations.

BLEND INTO THE CROWD
Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of
humans, dwarves, ar elves, making themselves valuable
and weJcome. The combination of their inherent stealth
and their unassuming
nature helps halflings to avoid
unwanted attention.
Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal
to their friends, whether halfling ar otherwise.
They can
display remarkable
ferocity when their friends, families,
ar communities
are threatened.
PASTORAL PLEASANTRIES
Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities
with
large farms and well-kept graves. They rarely build
kingdoms of their own ar even hold much land beyond
their quiet shires. They typically don't recognize any
sort of halfling nobility ar royalty, instead looking to
family elders to guide them. Families preserve their
traditional ways despite the rise and fali of empires.
Many halflings live among other races, where the
halflings' hard work and loyal outlook offer them
abundant
rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling
communities
travei as a way of life, driving wagons ar
guiding boats from place to place and maintaining
no
permanent
home.

EXPLORING
OPPORTUNITIES
Halflings usually seI out on the adventurer's
path lo
defend lheir communities,
support their friends, or
explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them,
adventuring
is less a career than an opportunity
or
sometimes
a necessity.
