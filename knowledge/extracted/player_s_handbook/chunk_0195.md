and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the
target's mind or to gain information about the target.
MINOR
ILLUSION
lIlusion cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components:
5, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration:
1 minute
Voucreate a sound or an image of an object within
range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if
you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
lf you create a sound, its volume can range from a
whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone
else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any
other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
throughout the duration, or you can make discrete
sounds at different times before the spell ends.
lf you create an image of an object-such
as a chair,
muddy footprints, or a small chest-it
must be no larger
than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light,
smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction
with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
things can pass through it.
lf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or
image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion
with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save De. If a creature discerns the
illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to
the creature.
MIRAGE
ARCANE
7th-levei illusion
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 5ight
Components:
V,5
Duration:
10 days
Vou make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square
look, sound, smell, and even feellike some other sort
of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the
same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to
resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult
or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like
a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a
rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
5imilarly, you can alter the appearance of structures,
or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't
disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and
olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into
difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede
movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory
terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the
spell's area disappears immediately.
Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion
to the terrain's true form; however, ali other elements
of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of

the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically
interact with the illusion.
MIRROR
IMAGE
2nd-levei illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5elf
Components:
V,5
Duration:
1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with
you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's
impossible to track which image is real. Vou can use
your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during
the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the
attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
lf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or
higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With
two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one
duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A
duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.
It ignores ali other damage and effects. The spell ends
when ali three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it
relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or
if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.
MISLEAD
5th-levei illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5elf
Components:
5
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Vou become invisible at the same time that an illusory
double of you appears where you are standing. The
double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if
you attack or cast a spell.
Vou can use your action to move your illusory double
up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and
behave in whatever way you choose.
Vou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears
as ifyou were located where it is. On each of your turns
as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses
to using your own, or back again. While you are using its
senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your
own surroundings.
