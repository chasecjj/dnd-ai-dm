INTRODUCTION
HEDUNGEONS& DRAGONSROLEPLAYING
game is about storytelling
in worlds of
swords and sorcery. !t shares elements
with childhood games of make-believe. Like
those games, 0&0 is driven by imagina-
tion. !t's about picturing the towering castle
beneath the stormy night sky and imagining
howa fantasy adventurer
might react to the challenges
that scene presents.
Oungeon Master (OM):After passing through the
craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east
and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling
towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach.
They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these,
a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep
fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm,
leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard.
The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their
rust.eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop
the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you
from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting
wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the
entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors ofCastle
Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into
the courtyard.
Phillip (playingGareth): Iwant to look at the
gargoyles. I have a feeling they're not just statues.
Amy(playingRival:The drawbridge looks precarious?
Iwant to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross
it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?
Unlike a game of make-believe, 0&0 gives structure
to the stories, a way of determining
the consequences
of the adventurers'
action. Players roll dice to resolve
whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adven-
turers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a
magicallightning
bolt, or pull off some other dangerous
task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some out-
comes more probable than others.
Oungeon Master (OM):OK, one at a time. Phillip,
you're looking at the gargoyles?
Phillip:Yeah. 15 there any hint they might be
creatures and not decorations?
OM: Make an Intelligence check.
Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?
OM: Sure!
Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven.
OM:They look likedecorations to you. And Amy,
Rivais checking out the drawbridge?
In the DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame, each player
creates an adventurer
(also called a character) and
teams up with other adventurers
(played by friends).
Working together, the group might explore a dark dun-
geon, a ruined city, a haunted castle. a lost temple deep
in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavero beneath a mysterious
mountain. The adventurers
can solve puzzles, talk with
other characters,
battle fantastic monsters,
and discover
fabulous magic items and other treasure.
One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon
Master (DM). the game's lead storyteller and referee.
The DM creates adventures
for the characters,
who nav-
igate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The
DM might describe the entrance
to Castle Ravenloft,
and the players decide what they want their adventurers
to do. WilI they walk across the dangerously
weathered
drawbridge?
Tie themselves together with rope to mini-
mize the chance that someone will fali if the drawbridge
gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?
Then the DM determines
the results of the adventur-
ers' actions and narrates
what they experience.
Because
the DM can improvise to react to anything the players
attempt, 0&0 is infinitely f1exible, and each adventure
can be exciting and unexpected.
The game has no real end; when one story or quest
wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing
story called a campaign.
Many people who play the
game keep their campaigns
going for months or years.
meeting with their friends every week or so to pick
up the story where they left off. The adventurers
grow
in might as the campaign continues.
Each monster
defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasurc
recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also
earos the adventurers
new capabilities. This increase
in power is reflected by an adventurer's
leveI.
There's no winning and losing in the DUNGEONS&
DRAGONSgame-at
least, not the way those terms are
usually understood. Together, the DM and lhe players
create an exciting story of bold adventurers
who confront
deadly perils. Sometimes
an adventurer might come to
a grisly end, toro apart by ferocious monsters or done in
bya nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers
can
search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade,
or the player might choose to create a new character to
carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure
successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created
a memorable story, they ali win.
WORLDS OF ADVENTURE
The many worlds of the DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame
are places of magic and monsters,
of brave warriors
and
spectacular
adventures.
They begin with a foundation
of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures,
places,
and magic that make these worlds unique.
The worlds of the DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame exist
within a vast cosmos called the multiverse,
connected
in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to
other planes of existence. such as the Elemental Plane
of Fire and the lnfinite Depths of the Abyss. Within
