three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5
to the tota!.
The same d notation appears in the expressions
"ld3"
and "ld2." To simulate the roll of Id3, roll a d6 and
divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate
the roll of Id2, roll any die and assign a I or 2 to the roll
depending
on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively,
if the number rolled is more than half the number of
sides on the die, it's a 2.)
THE D20
Does an adventurer's
sword swing hurt a dragon or just
bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an
outrageous
bluff? Can a character
swim across a raging
river? Can a character
avoid the main blast of a fireball,
or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In
cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,
the DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame relies on rolls of a
20-sided die, a d20, to determine
success or failure.
Every character
and monster in the game has capa-
bilities defined by six ability scores.
The abilities are
Strength,
Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma,
and they typically range from 3 to 18
for most adventurers.
(Monsters might have scores as
lowas
I or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the
ability modifiers
derived from them, are the basis for
almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a charac-
ter's or monster's behalf.
Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the
three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the
rules of the game. AIl three follow these simple steps.
1. Roll the die and add a modifier.
Roll a d20 and
add the relevant modifier. This is typically the mod-
ifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it
sometimes
includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a char-
acter's particular
skill. (See chapter I for details on each
ability and how to determine
an ability's modifier.)
2. Apply circumstantial
bonuses
and penalties.
A
class feature, a spell, a particular
circumstance,
ar some
other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.
3. Compare
the total to a target number.
If the total
equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise,
it's
a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines
target numbers and tells players whether their ability
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fai!'
The target number for an ability check or a saving
throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target
number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
This sim pie rule governs the resolution of most tasks
in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for
using the d20 in the game.
ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE
Sometimes
an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw
is modified by special situations called advantage and
disadvantage.
Advantage reflects the positive circum-
stances surrounding
a d20 roll, while disadvantage
reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or
disadvantage,
you roll a second d20 when you make the
roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advan-
tage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.
For example, if you have disadvantage
and roll a 17 and
a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll
those numbers, you use the 17.
More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage
are presented
in chapter 7.
SPECIFIC
BEATS GENERAL
This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3,
that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial
traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abili-
ties, and other game elements break the general ruIes in
some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the
game works. Remember this: lf a specific ruIe contra-
dicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.
Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance,
many adventurers
don't have proficiency with longbows,
but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That
trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other
examples of rule-breaking
are more conspicuous.
For
instance, an adventurer
can't normally pass through
walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic
accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.
ROUND
DOWN
There's one more general rule you need to know at the
outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game,
round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the
fraction is one-half or greater.
ADVENTURES
The DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame consists of a group
of characters
embarking
on an adventure that the Dun-
geon Master presents
to them. Each character
brings
particular
capabilities to the adventure in the form of
ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits,
equipment, and magic items. Every character
is dif-
ferent, with various strengths
and weaknesses,
so the
best party of adventurers
is one in which the characters
complement each other and cover the weaknesses
of
