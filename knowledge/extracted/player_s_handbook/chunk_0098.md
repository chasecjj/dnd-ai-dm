VARIANT ENTERTAINER:
GLADIATOR
A gladiator is as much an entertainer
as any minstrel
or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat
into a spectacle the crawd can enjoy. This kind of
flashy combat is your entertainer
routine, though you
might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor.
Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a
place to perform in any place that features combat for
entertainment-perhaps
a gladiatorial arena or secret
pit fighting club. Vou can replace the musical instrument
in your equipment package with an inexpensive but
unusual weapon, such as a trident or neto
FOLK HERO
Vou come from a humble social rank, but you are
destined for so much more. Already the people of
your home village regard you as their champion, and
your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and

that threaten
the common folk everywhere.

DEFINING
EVENT
Vou previously pursued a simple prafession among
the peasantry,
perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant,
shepherd, woodcutter,
ar gravedigger. But something

you for greater things. Choose or randomly determine

FEATURE:
RUSTIC HOSPITALITY
Since you come from the ranks of the common folk,
you fit in among them with ease. Vou can find a place
to hide, rest, or recuperate
among other commoners,
unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to
them. They will shield you from the law or anyone
else searching
for you, though they will not risk
their lives for YOU.
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
A folk hero is one of the common people, for better
or for worse. Most folk heraes look on their humble
origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming,
and their home
communities
remain very important
to them.
