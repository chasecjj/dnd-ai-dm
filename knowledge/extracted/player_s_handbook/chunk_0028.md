CHAPTER 3: CLASSES
OVENTURERS
ARE
EXTRAOROINARY
PEOPLE,
driven bya thirst for excitement into a
tife that others would never dare lead,
They are herocs, compelled to explore the
dark places of lhe world and take on lhe
challenges
lhat lesser women and men
can't stand against.
Class is the primary dcfinition of what your character
can do, !t's more than a profession; it's your character's
calling. Class shapes the way you think about the
world and intcract with it and your relationship
with
other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighler,
for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms
of strategy and maneuvering,
and see herself as just a
pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might
see himself as a willing servanl in a god's unfolding plan
or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the
fighter has contacts in a mercenary
company or army,
the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and
devotees who share his faith.
Your class gives you a variety of special features, such
as a fighter's mastery of weapons and armor, and a
wizard's spells. At low leveis, your class gives you only
two or three features, but as you advance in levei you
gain more and your existing features often improve.
Each class enlry in this chapter includes a table
summarizing
the benefits you gaio at every levei, and
a detailed explanalion
of each one.
Adventurers
sometimes
advance in more thao one
class. A rogue might switch direction in tife and swear
the oath of a paladin, A barbarian
might discover latent
magical abilily and dabble in the sorcerer class while
continuing to advance as a barbarian.
Elves are known
to combine martial mastery with magical training
and advance as fighters and wizards simultaneously.
Oplional rules for combining classes in this way, called
multiclassing,
appear in chapter 6.
Twelve classes-tisted
in the Classes table-are
found
in almost every D&D world and define lhe spectrum
of
lypical adventurers.
