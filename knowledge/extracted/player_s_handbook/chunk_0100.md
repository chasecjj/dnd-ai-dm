As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed
to creale finished items from raw materiaIs (reflected in
your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan's
tools),
as well as the principies of trade and good business
practices. The question now is whether you abandon
your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to
weave adventuring
and trade together.
FEATURE:
GUILD
MEMBERSHIP
As an established
and respected
member of a guild, you
can rely on certain benefits that membership
provides.
Your fellow guild members will provide you with
lodging and food if necessary,
and pay for your funeral
if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a
central place to meet other members
of your profession,
which can be a good place to meet potential patrons,
allies, or hirelings.
Guilds often wield tremendous
political power. If
you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you
if a good case can be made for your innocence or the
crime isjustifiable.
Vou can also gain access to powerful
political figures through the guild, if you are a member
in good standing. Such connections
might require the
donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
Vou must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If
you miss payments, you must make up back dues to
remain in the guild's good graces.
SUGGESTED
CHARACTERISTICS
Guild artisans
are among the most ordinary people in
the world-until
they set down their tools and take up
an adventuring
career. They understand
the value of
hard work and the importance
of community, but they're
vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

VARIANT
GUILD
ARTISAN:
GUlLD
MERCHANT
Instead of an artisans'
guild, you might belong to a
guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers.
Vou
don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying
and selling lhe works of others (or the raw materiaIs
artisans
need to practice lheir craft). Your guild might
be a large merchant consortium
(or family) with
interests across the region. Perhaps you transported
goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or
caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold
them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling
merchant's
life lends itself to adventure far more than
the life of an artisan.
Rather lhan proficiency with artisan's
tools, you might
be proficient with navigator's tools or an additional
language. And instead of artisan's
tools, you can start
with a mule and a carl.
