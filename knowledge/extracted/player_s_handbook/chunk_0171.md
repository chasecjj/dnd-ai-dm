For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain
creatures,
When you cast the spell and as your action on
each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind
on any one creature
that you can see within 30 feet of
you, If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of
3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the crealure
is unaffected.
Vou initially learn the surface thoughts of the
creature-what
is most on its mind in that moment. As
an action, you can either shift your atlention lo another
creature's
thoughts or atlempt to probe deeper into the
same creature's
mind. ]f you probe deeper, the target
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain
insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state,
and something
that looms large in ils mind (such as
something
it worries over, loves, or hates). ]f it succeeds,
the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are
probing into its mind, and unless you shift your atlention
to another creature's
thoughts, the creature
can use
its action on its turn to make an lntelligence check
contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds,
the spell ends.
Questions verbally directed at the target creature
naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell
is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
Vou can also use this spell to detect the presence of
thinking creatures
you can't see. When you cast the
spell or as your action during the duration, you can
search for thoughts within 30 feet of YOU.The spell can
penetrate
barriers,
but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any
metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.
Vou can't detect a creature with an lntelligence of 3 or
lower or one that doesn't speak any language.
Once you detecI the presence of a creature
in this way,
you can read its lhoughts for the rest of the duration as
described
above, even if you can't see it, but it must still
be within range.
DIMENSION
DOOR
4th-levei conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 500 feet
Components:
V
Duration:
Instantaneous
Vou teleport yourself from your current location lo any
other spot within range. Vou arrive at exactly the spot
desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can
visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance
and direclion, such as "200 feet straight downward" or
"upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet."
Vou can bring along objects as long as their weight
doesn't exceed what you can carry. Vou can also bring
one willing creature
of your size or smaller who is
carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature
must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
If you would arrive in a place already occupied byan
object or a creature, you and any creature
traveling with
you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to
teleport you.
DISGUISE
SELF
1st-levei iIIusion
,
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components:
V,S
Duration:
1 hour
Vou make yourself-including
your clothing, armor,
weapons, and other belongings on your person-Iook
different until the spell ends ar until you use your action
to dismiss it. Vou can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and
can appear thin, fat, or in belween. Vou can't change
your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the
same basic arrangement
of limbs. Otherwise,
the extent
of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up lo
physical inspection.
For example, if you use this spell
to add a hat to your oUlfit, objects pass through the hat,
and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would
feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear
thinner than you are, lhe hand of someone who reaches
out lOtouch you would bump into you while it was
seemingly still in midair.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use
its action to inspect your appearance
and must succeed
on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save De.
