POWER OF NATURE
Druids revere nalure above ali, gaining lheir spells and
olher magical powers eilher from the force of nalure
ilself or fram a nalure deily. Many druids pursue a
myslic spiriluality of lranscendent
union with nature
ralher than devotion to a divine entity, while others
serve gods of wild nature, animais, or elemental forces.
The ancienl druidic lraditions are sometimes
called
the Old Failh, in contrast to the worship of gods in
temples and shrines.
Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals-
the power of toolh and claw, of sun and moon, of fire
and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal
forms, and some druids make a particular
study of this
practice, even to the point where they prefer animal
form to their natural formo

THE BALANCE
For druids, nature exists in a precarious
balance. The

CREATING
A DRUID
and water-must
remain in equilibrium.
If one element
were to gain power over the others, the world could be
destroyed, drawn into one of the eJemental planes and
broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids
oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote
one element to the exclusion of others.
Druids are also concerncd
with the deJicate ecological
balance that sustains
plant and animallife,
and the need
for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in
opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in
nature, and they hate that which is unnatural,
including
aberrations
(such as beholders and mind f1ayers)
and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids
sometimes
lead raids against such creatures,
espccially
when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.
Druids arc often found guarding sacred sites or
watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a
significant danger arises, threatening
nature's balance
or the lands they protecl, druids take on a more active
role in combating the threal, as adventurers.
When making a druid, consider why your character
has
such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character
lives in a society where the Old Faith slill thrives, or was
raised bya druid after being abandoned
in the depths
of a forcst. Perhaps your character
had a dramatic
encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to
face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving lhe
experience.
Maybe your character
was born during an
epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreled
