SUN. HE THOUGHT
he saw theftgure of a man striding up the path. 5tanding,
Flint drew back into the shadow of a tall pine to see better.
The man's walk was marked by an easy grace-an
eluish
grace, Flint would haue said;yet the man's body had lhe
thickness and tight muscles of a human, while thefacial
hair was deftnite/y humankind's. Ali the dwarf could see
of the man'sface beneath a green hood was tan skin and a
brownish-red beard. A longbow was slung ouer one shoulder
and a sword hung at his left side. He was dressed in soft
leather, careful/y tooled in the intricate
designs the elues
loued. But no elfin the world of Krynn could grow a beard

"Tanis?" said Flint hesitant/y as the man neared.
"The same." The newcomer's beardedface split in a wide
grin. He held open his arms and, before the dwarf could
stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the
ground. The dwarf clasped his oldfriend closefor a brief
instant, then, rememberinghis
digni(y, squirmed andfreed
himself from lhe half-elf's embrace.

Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither,
half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities
of their elf and human parents: human curiosity,
inventiveness,
and ambition tempered by the refined
senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves.
Some half-elves Iive among humans, set apart by their
emotional and physical differences, watching friends
and loved ones age while time barely touches them.
Others Iive with the elves, growing restless as they
reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while
their peers continue to Iive as children. Many half-elves,
unable to fit into either society, choose Iives of solitary
wandering
or join with other misfits and outcasts in
the adventuring
life.
OF Two WORLDS
To humans,
half-elves look Iike elves, and to elves, they
look humano In height, they're on par with both parents,
though they're neither as slender as elves nor as broad
as humans. They range fram under 5 feet to about 6 feet
ta lI, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly
talIer and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have
facial hair, and sometimes
grow beards to mask their
elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie
somewhere
between their human and elf parents, and
thus sh'ow a variety even more pronounced
than that
found among either race. They tend to have the eyes
of their elven parents.

HALF- ELF NAMES
DIPLOMATS
OR WANDERERS
Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are
welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome
in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves
and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes
numerous
enough to form small communities
of their
own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the
onIy people who truIy understand
what it is to live
between these two worlds.
In most parts of the world. though, haIf-eIves are
uncommon
enough that one might live for years
without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to
avoid company altogether, wandering
the wilds as
trappers,
foresters, hunters, or adventurers
and visiting
civilization onIy rarely. Like elves, they are driven by
the wanderIust
that comes of their longevity. Others,
in contrast, throw themselves
into the thick of society,
putting their charisma
and social skilIs to great use
in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.
Half-elves use either human or elven naming
conventions. As if to emphasize
that they don't really fit
in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are
often given elven names, and those raised among elves
often take human names.
