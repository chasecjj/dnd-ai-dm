GUILD ARTISAN
Vou are a member of an artisan's
guild, skilled in
a particular
field and c10sely associated
with other
artisans.
Vou are a well-established
part of the
mercantile
world, freed by talent and wealth from the
constraints
of a feudal social order. Vou learned your
skills as an apprentice
to a master artisan, under the
sponsorship
of your guild, until you became a master in
your own right.
Skill Proficiencies:
lnsight, Persuasion
Tool Proficiencies:
One type of artisan's
tools
Languages:
One of your choice
Equiprnent:
A set of artisan's
tools (one of your choice),
a letter of introduction
from your guild, a set of
traveler's c1othes, and a belt pouch containing
15 gp
GUILD
BUSINESS
Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to
support several artisans
practicing the same trade.
However, your guild might instead be a loose network
of artisans
who each work in a different village within
a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine
the
nature of your guild. Vou can select your guild business
from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.
