The DM might also decide that certain environmental
phenomena,
such as a wave crashing over you while
you're on a storm-tossed
ship, require you to succeed
on a DC 10 Constitution
saving throw to maintain
concentration
on a spell.
TARGETS
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets
to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description
tells you whether the spell targets creatures,
objects, or
a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).
Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature
might not know it was targeted by a spell at alI. An effect
like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle
effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's
thoughts,
typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.
A CLEAR
PATH TO THE TARGET
To target something, you must have a clear path to it,
so it can't be behind total cover.
lf you place an area of effect at a point that you can't
see and an obstruction.
such as a wall, is between you
and that point, the point of origin comes into being on
the near side of that obstruction.
TARGETING
YOURSELF
lf a spell targets a creature
of your choice, you can
choose yourself, unless the creature
must be hostile or
speciticallya
creature
other than you. lf you are in the
area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.
AREAS
OF EFFECT
Spells such as burning hands and cone of cald cover an
area, allawing them to affect multiple creatures
at ance.
A spell's description
specities its area af effect,
which typically has ane of tive different shapes: cone,
cube, cylinder, line, ar sphere. Every area of effect has
a paint of origin, a locatian fram which the spell's
energy erupts. The roles for each shape specify how yau

pasition its point of origino Typically,
a point of origin is a point in space, but
some spells have an area whose origin is a
creature
or an object.
A spell's effect expands in straight lines fram the point
of origino If no unblocked straight line extends from the
point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that
location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of
these imaginary lines, an obstruction
must provi de total
cover, as explained in chapter 9.
CONE
A cone extends in a direction you choose fram its point
af origino A cone's width at a given point along its length
is equal to that point's distance from the point of origino
A cone's area of effect specities its maximum length.
A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
CUBE
Vou select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere
on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed
as the length of each side.
A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
CYLINDER
A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a
particular
radius, as given in the spell description.
The
circle must either be on the graund or at the height of
the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in
straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter
of
the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's
effect then shoots up fram the base or down fram the
top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.
A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's
area of effect.
