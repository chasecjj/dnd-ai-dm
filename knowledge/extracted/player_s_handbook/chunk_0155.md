An animated object is a construct
with AC, hit points,
attacks, Strength,
and Dexterity determined
by its size.
Its Constitution
is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom
control multi pie creatures,
you can command any or all
of them at the same time, issuing the same command to
each one). Vou decide what action the creature will take
and where it will move during its next turn, or you can
issue a general command, such as to guard a particular
chamber or corridor. lf you issue no commands,
the
creature
only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given an order, the creature
continues to follow it
until its task is complete.
The creature
is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you've given
it. To maintain control of the creature
for another
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
again before the current 24-hour period ends. This
use of the spell reasserts
your control over up to four
creatures
you have animated with this spell, rather than
animating a new one.
At Higher Leve/s. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th leveI or higher, you animate or reassert
contraI over two additional undead creatures
for each
slot levei above 3rd. Each of the creatures
must come
from a different corpse or pile of bones.

ten nonmagical

count as eight objects. Vou can't animate any object
larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a

reduced to Ohit points.
As a bonus action, you can mentally command any
creature you made with this spell if the creature
is
within 500 feet of you (if you contrai multiple creatures,
you can command any or all of them at the same time,
issuing the same command to each one). Vou decide
what action the creature will take and where it will
move during its next turn, or you can issue a general
command, such as to guard a particular
chamber or
corridor. If you issue no commands,
the creature only
defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given
an order, the creature
continues to follow it until its
task is complete.

Range: Self (IO-foot radius)
Components:
V, S
Duration:
Concentration,
up to 1 hour
A shimmering
barrier extends out from you in a IO-foot
radius and moves with you, remaining
centered on
you and hedging out creatures
other than undead and
constrllcts.
The barrier lasts for the duration.
The barrier prevents an affected creature
from
passing or reaching through. An affected creature
can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach
weapons through the barrier.

pass through the barrier, the spell ends.

Range: Self (IO-foot-radius sphere)
Components:
V,S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or
iron filings)
Duration:
Concentration,
up to I hour
A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surraunds
you. This area is divorced fram the magical energy that
suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't
be cast, summoned
creatures
disappear, and even magic
items become mundane. Unti! the spell ends, the sphere
moves with you, centered on you.
Spells and other magical effects, except those created
by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed
in the sphere
and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast
a suppressed
spell is consumed.
While an effect is
suppressed,
it doesn't function, but the time it spends
suppressed
counts against its duration.
Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,
such as ma(jic missi/e and charm person, that target
a creature
or an object in the sphere have no effect
on that target.
