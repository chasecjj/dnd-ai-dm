RITUAL
CASTER
Prerequisite: Intelligence or Wisdom 13 or higher
Vou have learned a number of spells that you can cast as
rituais. These spells are written in a ritual book, which
you must have in hand while casting one of them.
When you choose this feat, you aequire a ritual book
holding two 1st-levei spells of your ehoiee. Choose one
of the following classes: bard, c1erie, druid, soreerer,
warlock, or wizard. Vou must choose your spells
from that c1ass's spelllist,
and the spells you choose
must have the ritual tag. The c1ass you ehoose also
determines
your spelleasting
ability for these spells:
Charisma
for bard, sorcerer, or warloek; Wisdom for
c1eric or druid; or Intelligenee for wizard.
\f you come aeross a spell in written form, sueh as a
magical speJl seroJl or a wizard's spellbook, you might
be able to add lt to your ritual book. The spell must be
on the spelllist
for the c1ass you chose, the spell's leveI
ean be no higher than half your levei (rounded up), and
it must have the ritual tag. The proeess of copying the
spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per levei of the
spell, and eosts 50 gp per leveI. The cost represents
material components
you expend as you cxperiment
with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you
need to record it.
