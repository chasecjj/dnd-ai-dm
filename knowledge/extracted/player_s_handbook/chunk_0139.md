CHAPTER 9: COMBAT
HE CLATTER OF A SWORD STRIKING AGAINST
a shield. The terrible rending sound as
monstrous
claws tear through armor. A
brilliant flash of light as a ball of f1ame
blossoms from a wizard's spell. The sharp
tang of blood in the air, cutting through
the stench of vile monsters.
Roars of fury,
shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in 0&0 can be
chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.
This chapter provides the rules you need for your
characters
and monsters to engage in combat, whether
it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a
dungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout
this chapter,
the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master.
The Dungeon Master controls ali the monsters and
nonplayer characters
involved in combat, and each other
player controls an adventurer.
"You" can also mean the
character
or monster that you control.
THE ORDER OF COMBAT
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two
sides, a f1urry of weapon swings, feints, parries,
footwork, and spellcasting.
The game organizes the
chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A
round
represents
about 6 seconds in the game world.
During a round, each participant
in a battle takes a
turno The order of turns is determined
at the beginning
of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative.
Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues
to
the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
SURPRISE
A band of adventurers
sneaks up on a bandit camp,
springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous
cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by
the adventurers
until the cube engulfs one of them. In
these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise
over the other.
The DM determines
who might be surprised.
If
neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically
notice
each other. Otherwise,
the DM compares
the Dexterity
(Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive
Wisdom (Perception)
score of each creature

opposing side. Any character
or monster that doesn't
notice a threat is surprised
at the start of the encounter.
If you're surprised,
you can't move or take an aclion
on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a
reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can
be surprised
even if the other members aren't.
INITIATIVE
Initiative determines
the order of turns during combat.
When combat starts, every participant
makes a
Dexterity check lOdetermine
their place in the initiative
order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of
identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at
the same time.
The DM ranks the combatants
in order from the one
with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with
the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order)
in which they act during each round. The initiative order
remains the same from round to round.
If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among
tied DM-controlled creatures,
and the players decide
the order among their tied characters.
The DM can
decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a
player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied
characters
and monsters each roll a d20 to determine
the order, highest roll going first.
YOUR TURN
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed
and take one aetion. Vou decide whether to move first
or take your action first. Your speed-sometimes
ealled
your walking speed-is
noted on your eharacter
sheet.
The most common actions you can take are described
in the "Actions in Combat" section later in this chapter.
Many class features and other abilities provide
additional options for your action.
The "Movement and Position" section later in this
chapter gives the ru les for your move.
Vou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing
anything at ali on your turn.lfyou
can't decide what to
do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready
action, as described
in "Actions in Combat."
BONUS ACTIONS
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you
take an additional action on your turn called a bonus
action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows
a rogue to take a bonus action. Vou can take a bonus
action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature
of the game states that you can do something
as a bonus
action. Vou otherwise
don't have a bonus action to take.
Vou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so
you must choose which bonus action to use when you
have more than one available.
Vou choose when to take a bonus action during your
turn, unless the bonlls action's timing is specified, and
anything that deprives you ofyour ability to take actions
also prevents you from taking a bonus action.
