their companions.
The advenlurers
musl coopera te to
successfully
complete the adventure.
The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with
a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might
be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased
off the
shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM's needs and
desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic
selting, whether it's an underground
dungeon, a crum-
bling castle, a stretch of wilderness,
or a bustIing city.
It features a rieh cast of characters:
the adventurers
created and played by the other players at the table,
as well as nonplayer characters
(NPCs). Those char-
acters might be palrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or
just background
extras in an adventure.
Often, one of
the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an
adventure's
action.
Over the course of their adventures,
the characters
are confronted
bya variety of creatures,
objects, and
situations that they must deal with in some way. Some-
times the adventurers
and other creatures
do their
best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other
times, the adventurers
talk to another creature
(or even
a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the
adventurers
spend time trying to solve a puzzIe, bypass
an obstacle, find something
hidden, or unraveI the cur-
rent situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers
explore the
worId, making decisions about which way lo traveI and
what they'1I try to do next.
Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short
adventure might present only a few challenges,
and
it might take no more than a single game session to
complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds
of
combats, interactions,
and other challenges,
and take
dozens of sessions
to play through, stretching
over
weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an
adventure is marked by the adventurers
heading back to
civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.
Sut that's not the end of the story. Vou can think of
an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made
up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole
series-a
string of adventures joined together, with a
consistent group of advenlurcrs
following the narrative
from start to finish.
THE THREE PILLARS OF ADVENTURE
Adventurers
can try to do anything their players can
imagine, bul it can be helpful to talk about their activ-
ities in three broad categories: exploration, social
interaction, and combat.
ExpIoration
includes both lhe adventurers'
movement
through the worId and their interaction with objects and
situations that require their altention. Exploration is the
give-and-take of the players describing
what lhey wanl
their characters
lOdo, and the Dungeon Master telling
the players whal happens as a result. On a large scale,
that might involve lhe characters
spending a day cross-
ing a rolling plain or an hour making lheir way through
caverns underground.
On the smallest scale, il could
mean one characler
pulling a lever in a dungeon room lo
see what happens.
Social interaction
features the advenlurers
talking to
someone (or something) else. lt might mean demanding
INTRODUCTION
that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance
to the
goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner,
pleading for mercy from an ore chieftain, or persuading
a talkative magic mirror to show a dislant location to
the advenlurers.
The rules in chapters
7 and 8 support exploration and
social interaclion, as do many c1ass features in chapler 3
and personality
traits in chapter 4.
Combat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters
and other creatures
swinging weapons, casting spells,
maneuvering
for position, and so on-all
in an effort
to defeat their opponents,
whether that means killing
every enemy, laking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat
is the most struclured
element of a D&D session, with
creatures
taking turns to make sure that everyone gets
a chance to act. Even in the contexl of a pitched battIe,
there's still plenty of opportunity
for adventurers
to
altempt wacky stunts like surfing down a lIight of stairs
on a shield, to examine the environment
(perhaps by
pulling a mysterious lever), and lOinteract with other
creatures,
including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.
THE WONDERS OF MAGIC
Few D&D adventures
end without something
magical
happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magie appears
frequently in the life of an advenlurer, and it is the focus
of chapters
10 and 11.
In the worlds of DUNGEONS& DRAGONS,practitioners
of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people
by their extraordinary
talent. Common foIk l11ightsee
evidcnce of magic on a regular basis, but it's usually
minor-a
fantastic monster, a visibly answered
prayer,
a wizard walking through the streets with an animated
shieId guardian as a bodyguard.
For adventurers,
though, magic is key to their sur-
viva\. Without the healing magie of c1erics and paladins,
adventurers
would quickly succumb to their wounds.
Wilhout the uplifting magieal support of bards and
c1erics, warriors
might be overwhelmed
by powerful
foes. Withoul the sheer magieal power and versatility
of wizards and druids, every threat would bc mag-
nified tenfold.
Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adven-
tures are driven by the machinations
of spellcaslers
who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult
leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath
the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them
of lheir vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of
automatons
with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a
mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction-these
are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers
might face. With magic of their own, in the form of
spells and magic items, the adventurers
might prevail!
