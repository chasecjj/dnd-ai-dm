WIZARD
Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an
elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions
of the
battletield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving
in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a
tiny bead of tire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts
into a confiagration
that engulfs the soldiers.
Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes
an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone
fioor, then sprinkles
powdered iron along every line and
graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a
long incantation.
A hole opens in space inside the circle,
bringing a whiff of brimstone
from the otherworldly
plane beyond.
Crouching on the fioor in a dungeon intersection,
a
gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with
mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly,
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the
passage to his left.
Wizards are supreme magic-users,
detined and united
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
weave of magic that permeates
the cosmos, wizards cast
spel1s of explosive tire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
and brute.force mind control. Their magic conjures
monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the
future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest
spel1s change one substance
into another, cal1 meteors
down from the sky, or open portaIs to other worlds.
SCHOLARS
OF THE ARCANE
Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the
power of magic draws students who seek to master
its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods,
shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical
spel1 requires merely the utterance
of a few strange
words, fieeting gestures,
and sometimes
a pinch or
clump of exotic materiaIs, these surface components
barely hint at the expertise attained after years of
apprenticeship
and countless
haurs of study.
Wizards live and die by their spel1s. Everything else
is secondary. They learn new spel1s as they experiment
and grow in experience.
They can also learn them fram
other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions,
and from ancient creatures
(such as the fey) that are
steeped in magic.

THE LURE OF KNOWLEDGE
Wizards'
lives are seldom
mundane,
The dosest
a
wizard
is likely to come
to an ordinary
life is working
as a sage or lecturer
in a library
or university,
teaching
others
the secrets
of the multiverse.
Other
wizards
sell
their
services
as diviners,
serve
in military
forces,
or
pursue
lives of crime
or domination.
But the lure of knowledge
and power
calls even the
most
unadventurous
wizards
out of the safety
of their
libraries
and laboratories
and into crumbling
ruins
and
lost cities.
Most wizards
believe
that their
counterparts
in ancient
civilizations
knew secrets
of magic
that have
been
lost to the ages,
and discovering
those
secrets
could
unlock
the path to a power
greater
than
any magic
available
in the present
age.
CREATING
A WIZARD
Creating
a wizard
character
demands
a backstory
dominated
by at least one extraordinary
event.
How
did your character
first come
into contact
with magic?
How did you discover
you had an aptitude
for it? Do
you have a natural
talent,
or did you simply
study
hard
and practice
incessantly?
Did you encounter
a
magical
creature
or an ancient
tome that taught
you the
basics
of magic?
What
drew you forth from your life of study?
Did your
first taste
of magical
knowledge
leave you hungry
for
more?
Have you received
word of a secret
repository
of knowledge
not yet plundered
by any other
wizard?
Perhaps
you're
simply
eager
to put your newfound
magical
skills
to the test in the face of danger.
