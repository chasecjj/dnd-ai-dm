check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win
the contest, you either knock the target prone or push
it 5 feet away from you.
COVER
Walls, trees, creatures,
and other obstacles can provide
cover during combat, making a target more difficult
to harm. A target can benetit from cover only when an
attack or other effect originates on the opposite side
of the cover.
There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind
multi pIe sources of cover, only the most protective
degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added
together. For example, if a target is behind a creature
that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-
quarters
cover, the target has three-quarters
cover.
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and
Oexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an
obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle
might be a low wall. a large piece of furniture,
a narrow
tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature
is an
enemy or a friend.
A target with three-quarters
cover has a +5 bonus
to AC and Oexterity saving throws. A target has three-
quarters
cover if about three-quarters
of it is covered
by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis. an
arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly
by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach
such a target by including it in an area of effect. A
target has total cover if it is completely concealed by
an obstacle.
DAMAGE AND HEALING
Injury and the risk of death are constant companions
of those who explore the worlds of 0&0. The thrust of
a sword. a well-placed arrow, or a blast of f1ame from a
firebaJl spell ali have the potential to damage. or even
kill. the hardiest of creatures.
HIT POINTS
Hit points represent
a combination
of physical and
mental durability. the will to live, and luck. Creatures
with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those
with fewer hit points are more fragile.
A creature's
current hit points (usually just called hit
points) can be any number from the creature's
hit point
maximum down to O. This number changes frequently
as a creature
takes damage ar receives healing.
Whenever a creature
takes damage, that damage is
subtracted
from its hit points. The loss of hit points has
no effect on a creature's
capabilities
until the creature
drops to O hit points.
DAMAGE ROLLS
Each weapon. spell. and harmful monster ability
specifies the damage it deals. Vou roll the damage die
or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to
your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other
factors can grant a bonus to damage.
PART 2 I COMBAT
When attacking with a weapon. you add your ability
modifier-the
same modifier used for the attack roll-
to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for
damage and whether to add any modifiers.
If a spell ar other effect deals damage to more than
one target at the same time, roll the damage once for
ali of them. For example, when a wizard casts firebaJl or
a cleric casts liame strike, the spell's damage is rolled
once for ali creatures
caught in the blast.
CRITICAL
HITS
When you score a criticai hit, you get to roll extra dice
for the attack's damage against the target. RolI ali of the
attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then
add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play.
you can roll ali the damage dice alonce.
For example, if you score a criticai hit with a dagger,
roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than Id4, and then add
your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other
damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack
feature, you roll those dice twice as well.
DAMAGE TYPES
Oifferent attacks. damaging spells, and other harmful
effects deal different types of damage. Oamage types
have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as
damage resistance,
rely on the types.
The damage types follow, with examples to help a
DM assign a damage type to a new effect.
