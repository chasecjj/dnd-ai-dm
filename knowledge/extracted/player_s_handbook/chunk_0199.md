PHANTASMAL KILLER
4th-leveI illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range:
120 feet
Components:
V,S
Duration:
Concentration,
up to 1 minute
Vou tap into the nightmares
of a creature you can see
within range and create an illusory manifestation
of its
deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the
start of each of the target's turns before the spell ends,
the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
ar take 4d 10 psychic damage. On a successful save,
the spell ends.
At Higher Leve/s. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th levei ar higher, the damage increases
by
ldlO for each slot levei above 4th.
PHANTOM STEED
3rd-/evel iIIusion (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Components:
V, S
Duration:
1 hour
A Large quasi-real, horselike creature
appears on
the ground in an unoccupied space ofyour choice
within range. Vou decide the creature's
appearance,
but it is equipped with a saddle, bit. and bridle. Any
of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a
puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away
from the steed.
For the duration, you or a creature you choose can
ride the steed. The creature
uses the statistics for a
riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can
travei 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace.
When the spell ends. the steed gradually fades. giving
the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use
an action to dismiss it ar if the steed takes any damage.
PLANARALLY
6th-leveI conjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 60 feet
Components:
V,S
Duration:
Instantaneous
Vou beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being
must be known to you: a god. a primordial, a demon
prince, ar some other being of cosmic power. That entity
sends a celestial, an elemental. ar a fiend loyal to it to
aid you, making the creature
appear in an unoccupied
space within range. Ifyou know a specific crcature's
name. you can speak that name when you cast this spell
to request that creature, though you might get a different
creature
anyway (DM's choice).
When the creature
appears. it is under no compulsion
to behave in any particular
way. Vou can ask the
creature
to perform a service in exchange for payment,
but it isn't obligcd to do so. The rcquested
task could
range from simple (flyus across the chasm, or hclp us
fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies. or protect
us during our foray into the dungeon). Vou must be
abJe to communicate
with the creature
to bargain for
its services.
Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might
require a sizable donation of gold ar magic items to
an allied temple. while a fiend might demand a living
sacrifice or a gift of treasure.
Some creatures
might
exchange their service for a quest undertaken
by you.
As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured
in
minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A
task measured
in hours requires
1,000 gp per hour. And
a task measured
in days (up to 10 days) requires
10.000
gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on
the circumstances
under which you cast the spel!. If the
task is aligned with the creature's
ethos, the payment
might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous
tasks
typically require only half the suggested payment, while
especially dangerous
tasks might require a greater gift.
Creatures
rarely accept tasks that seem suicida!'
After the creature
completes the task, or when the
agreed-upon
duration of service expires, the creature
returns to its home plane after reporting back to you.
if appropriate
to the task and if possible. ]f you are
unable to agree on a price for the creature's
service, the
creature
immediately returns to its home plane.
A creature
enlisted to join your group counts as
a member of it, receiving a full share of experience
points awarded.
PLANAR BINDING
5th-leveI abjuration
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 60 feet
Components:
V.S. M (a jewel worth at least 1.000 gP.
which the spell consumes)
Duration:
24 hours
With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial. an
elemental. a fey. or a fiend to your service. The creature
must be within range for the entire casting of the spel!.
(Typically. the creature
is first summoned
into the center
of an inverted magie eircle in arder to keep it trapped
while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting,
the target must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a
failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If
the creature was summoned
ar created by another spell.
that spell's duration is extended to match the duration
of this spel!.
A bound creature
must follow your instructions
to the
best of its ability. Vou might command the creature
to
accompany you on an adventure. to guard a location. or
to deliver a message. The creature
obeys the letter of
your instructions.
but if the creature
is hostil e to you. it
strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives.
]f the creature
carries out your instructions
completely
before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact
if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a
different plane of existence. it returns to the place where
you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
At Higher Leve/s. When YOllcast this spellllsing
a
spell slot of a higher levei, the duration increases
to 10
days with a 6th-levei slot, to 30 days with a 7th-levei slot.
to 180 days with an 8th-levei slot. and to a year and a
day with a 9th-levei spell slot.
