Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five
questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life,
inc1uding the languages it knew. Answers are usually
brief, cryptic, ar repetitive, and the corpse is under no
compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile
to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't
return the creature's
soul to its body, only its animating
spiril. Thus, the corpse can't learn new Information,
doesn't comprehend
anything that has happened since it
died, and can't speculate about future events.

about crealures
that have passed, weather, and other

growth (such as thickets and undergrowth)
into ordinary
terrain that lasls for the duratlon. Or you can turn
ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult
terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and
branches
to hindcr pursuers,
for example.
Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your
behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable
plants to uproot themselves
and move about, but they
can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.
lf a plant creature
