MONASTIC
ORDERS
lhe worlds of D&D contain a multitude of monasteries
and monastic traditions.
In lands with an Asian cultural
flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten
Realms, these monasteries
are associated
with philosophical
traditions and martial arts practice. lhe Iron Hand School,
the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and
the Southern Star School ofShou
Lung teach different
approaches
to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines
of the monk. Some of these monasteries
have spread to the
western lands of FaerOn, particularly in places with large
Shou immigrant communities.
such as lhesk
and Westgate.
Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who
teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline.
In the Forgotten Realms, the order ofthe Dark Moon is
made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who
maintain secret communities
in remote hills, back allies,
and subterranean
hideaways. Monasteries
of IImater (god
of endurance)
are named after flowers, and their orders
carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of
Saint Sollars the lwice-Martyred
reside in the Monastery of
the Yellow Rose near Damara. lhe monasteries
of Eberron
combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship.
Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Hosl.
In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to
Majere, god of meditation and thoughl. In Greyhawk, many
monasteries
are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight
and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of
mental and physical mastery.
lhe evil monks ofthe Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of
Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god
but from dedication to the principies oftheir nation and their
race-the
belief that the Suei strand of humanity are meant
to rule the world .
