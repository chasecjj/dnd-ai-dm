MODIFY
MEMORY
5th-leveI enehantment
Casting Time: I aetion
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, 5
Duration: Coneentration,
up to I minute
Vou attempt to reshape another ereature's
memories.
One ereature
that you ean see must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If you are fighting the ereature,
it has
advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the
target beeomes eharmed by you for the duration. The
eharmed
target is ineapacitated
and unaware of its
surroundings,
though it ean still hear you. If it takes any
damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends,
and none of the target's memories are modified.
While this eharm lasts, you ean affeet the target's
memory of an event that it experieneed
within the last
24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. Vou
ean permanently
eliminate ali memory of the event,
allow the target to reeall the event with perfeet c!arity
and exaeting detail, ehange its memory of the details of
the event, or ereate a memory of some other event.
Vou must speak to the target to deseribe how
its memories are affeeted, and it must be able to
understand
your language for the modified memories to
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your
description.
If the spell ends before you have finished
describing
the modified memories, the creature's
memory isn't altered. Otherwise,
the modified memories
take hold when the spell ends.
A modified memory doesn't neeessarily
affect how a
creature
behaves, particularly
if the memory contradicts
the creature's
natural inc!inations, alignment, or beliefs.
An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a
memory of how much the creature
enjoyed dousing
itself in acid, is dismissed,
perhaps as a bad dream. The
DM might deem a modified memory toa nonsensical
to
affect a creature
in a significant manner.
A remove eurse or greater restoration spell cast on the
target restores the creature's
true memory.
At Higher LeveIs. If you east this spell using a spell
slot of 6th leveI or higher, you can alter the target's
memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago
(6th levei), 30 days ago (7th levei), I year ago (8th levei),
or any time in the creature's
past (9th levei).
MOONBEAM
2nd-leveI evoeation
Casting Time: I action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V,5, M (severa I seeds of any moonseed
plant and a pieee of opaleseent
feldspar)
Duration: Concentration,
up to 1 minute
A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-
radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within
range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
When a creature enters the spell's area for the first
time on aturo
or starts its turo there, it is engulfed
in ghostly liames that cause searing pain, and it must
make a Constitution
saving throw. It takes 2dlO radiant
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successfu I one.
A shapechanger
makes its saving throw with
disadvantage.
Ir it fails, it also instantly reverts to its
original form and can't assume a different form until it
leaves the spell's light.
On each of your turos after you cast this spell, you can
use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.
At Higher LeveIs. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd levei or higher, the damage increases
by
ldlO for each slot leveI above 2nd.
MORDENKAINEN'S
FAITHFUL
HOUND
4th-leveI eorijuration
Casting Time: I action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V,5, M (a tiny silver whistle, a pieee of
bone, and a thread)
Duration: 8 hours
Vou conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied
space that you can see within range, where it remains
for the duration, until you disrniss it as an action, or until
you move more than 100 feet away from it.
The hound is invisible to ali creatures
except you
and can't be harmed. When a 5mall or larger creature
comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking
the
password that you specify when you cast this spell, the
hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible
creatures
and can see into the Ethereal
Plane. It
ignores illusions.
At the start of each of your turos, the hound attempts
to bite one creature
within 5 feet of it that is hostile
to you. The hound's attack bonus is equal to your
spellcasting
ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.
On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.

Vou conjure an extradimensional
dwelling in range
that lasts for the duration. Vou choose where its one
entrance
is located. The entrance shimmers
faintly
and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. Vou and any creature
you designate when you cast the spell can enter the
extradimensional
dwelling as long as the portal remains
open. Vou can open or c!ose the portal if you are within
30 feet of it. While c!osed, the portal is invisible.

course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100
near-transparent
servants attends ali who enter. Vou
