Skilled hirelings include anyone hired lo perform a
service that involves a proficiency (including weapon,
tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on.
The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings
require more pay. Untrained
hirelings are hired for
menial work that requires no particular
skill and can
include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.
SPELLCASTING
SERVICES
When you make your character, you can roll once on
lhe Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly
touched by mystery. The DM might also use this table.
It can help stock a room in a dungeon or fiHa creature's
pockets.
People who are able to cast spells don't fali into the
category of ordinary hirelings. lt might be possible to
find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin
or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established
pay
rates exisl. As a rule, the higher the leveI of the desired
spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast il
and the more it costs.
Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell
of 1st or 2nd levei, such as cure wounds or identify, is
easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50
gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material
components).
Finding someone able and wiHing to
cast a higher-Ievel spell might involve traveling to a
large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent
temple. Once found, lhe spellcaster
might ask for a
service instead of payment-the
kind of service that
only adventurers
can provide, such as retrieving arare
item from a dangerous
locale or traversing a monster-
infested wilderness
to deliver somelhing
important
to
a distant settlemenl.

SERVICES
SERVICES
Advenlurers
can pay nonplayer characters
to assist them
or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances.
Most
such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others
are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with
specialized
adventuring
skills.
Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on
the Services table. Other common hirelings include
any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical
town or city, when the adventurers
pay them to
perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might
paya carpenter
to conslruct
an elaborale chest (and
ils miniature
replica) for use in the Leomund's
secret
chest spell. A fighter might commission
a blacksmilh
to
forge a special sword. A bard mighl pay a tailor lo make
exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance
in
front of the duke.
Olher hirelings provide more expert or dangerous
services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the
advenlurers
take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as
are sages hired to research
ancient or esoleric lore. If a
high-Ievel adventurer
establishes
a stronghold of some
kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and
agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward
to meniallaborers
lo keep the stables clean. These
hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes
a place to live within lhe stronghold as part of the
offered compensation.
