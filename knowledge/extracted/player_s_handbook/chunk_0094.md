ACOLYTE
Vou have spent your life in the service of a temple
to a specific god or pantheon of gods, Vou act as an
intermediary
between the realm of the holy and the
mortal world, performing
sacred rites and offering
sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers
into the
presence
of the divine. Vou are not necessarily
a
cleric-performing
sacred rites is not the same thing aS
channeling
divine power.
Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other
quasi-divine being from among those listed in appendix
B or those specified by your DM, and work with your
DM to detail the nature of your religious service.
Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or
were you a high priest who suddenly experienced
a call
to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were
the leader of a small cult outside of any established
tem pIe structure,
or even an occult group that served a
fiendish master that you now deny.
Skill Proficiencies:
Insight, Religion
Languages:
Two of your choice
Equiprnent:
A holy symbol (a gift to you when you
entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer
wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common
clothes, and a belt pouch containing
15 gp
FEATURE:
SHELTER
OF THE
FAITHFUL
As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who
share your faith, and you can perform the religious
ceremonies
of your deity. You and your adventuring
companions
can expect to receive free healing and
care at a temple, shrine, or other established
presence
of your faith, though you must provide any material
components
needed for spells. Those who share
your religion will support you (but only you) at a
modest lifestyle.
Vou might also have ties to a specific tem pIe dedicated
to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a
residence there, This could be the temple where you
used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a
temple where you have found a new home, While near
your temple. you can call upon the priests for assistance.
provided the assistance
you ask for is not hazardous
and
you remain in good standing with your temple.
SUGGESTED
CHARACTERISTICS
Acolytes are shaped by their experience
in temples
or other religious communities.
Their study of the
history and tenets of their faith and their relationships
to temples, shrines, or hierarchies
affect their
mannerisms
and ideaIs. Their flaws might be some
hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond
taken to an extreme.
