DISCIPLE
OF THE ELEMENTS
When you choose lhis lradilion ai 3rd levei, you learn
magical disciplines lhal harness
lhe power of lhe four
elemenls. A discipline requires you lo spend ki points
each time you use it.
Vou know lhe Elemenlal Allunemenl
discipline and
one olher elemenlal discipline of your choice, which are
delailed in lhe "Elemental
Disciplines" seclion below.
Vou learn one addilional elemental discipline of your
choice ai 61h, 111h.and 17th leveI.
Whenever you learn a new elemenlal discipline,
you can also replace one elemenlal discipline lhal you
already know wilh a different discipline.
Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemenlal
disciplines allow you to casl spells. See chapter 10 for
lhe general rules of spellcasling.
To cast one of lhese
spells, you use ils casting time and olher rules. but you
don'l need lo provide malerial componenls
for it.
Once you reach 51h levei in lhis class. you can spend
additional ki poinls lo increase the levei of an elemenlal
discipline spelllhal
you cas!, provided lhallhe
spell has
an enhanced
effecl at a higher levei. as burning hands
does. The spell's leveI increases
by 1 for each addilional
ki poinl you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-levei
monk and use Sweeping Cinder Slrike lo casl burning
hands, you can spend 3 ki poinls lo casl it as a 2nd-levei
spell (lhe discipline's base cosi of 2 ki poinls plus I).
The maximum number of ki poinls you can spend lo
casl a spell in lhis Way(including ils base ki point cosi
and any addilional ki poinls you spend lOincrease its
levei) is delermined
by your monk levei. as shown in lhe
Spells and Ki Poinls table.
Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a lradilion lhal
values sleallh and sublerfuge. These monks might
be called ninjas or shadowdancers.
and they serve as
spies and assassins.
Somelimes
the members
of a
ninja monaslery
are family members, forming a clan
sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Olher
monasleries
are more like lhieves' guilds, hiring oul
their services lo nobles, rich merchanls,
or anyone else
who can pay lheir fees. Regardless
of their melhods, lhe
heads of lhese monasleries
expect lhe unqueslioning
obedience of lheir sludenls.
SHADOW ARTS

can use your ki lo duplicate lhe effecls of certain spells.
As an action. you can spend 2 ki poinls lo casl darkness,
darkvision. pass without trace, or si/ence. wilhoul
providing malerial components.
Addilionally. you gain

number of days equallo

unless you use your action lo end lhem.
To do so. you and lhe largel musl be on lhe same plane
of exislence. When you use lhis aclion. lhe crealure
