OTHER
HERMITS
This hermit background assumes
a contempla tive sort
of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you
want to play a rugged wilderness
recluse who lives off
the land while shunning the company of other people,
look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if
you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte
might be what you're looking for. Or you could even be a
charlatan,
posing as a wise and holy person and letting
pious fools support you.
NOBLE
Vou understand
wealth, power, and privilege. Vou
carrya
noble title, and your family owns land, collects
taxes, and wields significant political influence. Vou
might be a pampered aristocrat
unfamiliar with
work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated
to the nobility, or a disinherited
scoundrel with a
disproportionate
sense of entitlement.
Or you could be
an honest, hard-working
landowner who cares deeply
about the people who live and work on your land, keenly
aware of your responsibility
to them.
Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate
title and determine
how much authority that title
carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own-it's
connected
to an entire family, and whatever title you
hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not
only do you need to determine your noble title, but you
should also work with the DM to describe your family
and their influence on you.
Is your family old and established,
or was your title
only recently bestowed? How much influence do they
wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation
does your family have among the other aristocrats
of the
region? How do the common people regard them?
What's your position in the family? Are you the heir
to the head of the family? Have you already inherited
the title? How do you feel about that responsibility?
Or
are you so far down the line of inheritance
that no one
cares what you do, as long as you don't embarrass
the
family? How does the head of your family feel about
your adventuring
career? Are you in your family's good
graces, or shunned
by the rest of your family?
Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you
might wear on a signet ring? Particular
colors you wear
all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your
line or even a spiritual member of the family?
These details help establish your family and your title
as features of the world of the campaign.

FEATURE:
POSITION
OF PRIVILEGE
Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to
think the best of you. Vou are welcome in high society,
and people assume you have the right to be wherever
you are. The common folk make every effort to
accommodate
you and avoid your displeasurc,
and other
people of high birth treal you as a member of the same
social sphere. Vou can secure an audience with a local
noble if you need to.
SUGGESTED
CHARACTERISTICS
Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle
than most people ever experience, and their personalities
reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a
plethora of bonds-responsibilities
to family, to other
nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted
to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this
responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.
