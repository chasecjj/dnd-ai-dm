STROKE OF LUCK
At 20th leveI, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding
when you need to. If your attack misses a target within
range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if
you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
.Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a short or long resto
ROGUISH
ARCHETYPES
Rogues have many features in common, including their
emphasis
on perfecting their skills, their precise and
deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick
reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in
varying directions,
embodied by the rogue archetypes.
Vour choice of archetype
is a reflection of your focus-
not necessarily
an indication of your chosen profession,
but a description
of your preferred
techniques.
THIEF
Vou hone your skills in the larcenous
arts. Burglars,
bandits, cutpurses,
and other criminais
typically follow
this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of
themselves as professional
treasure
seekers, explorers,
delvers, and investigators.
In addition to improving your
agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar
languages, and using
magic items you normally couldn't employ.
FAST HANDS
Starting at 3rd leveI, you can use the bonus action
granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to
disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an
Object action.
SECOND-STORY
WORK
When you choose this archetype at 3rd levei, you gain
the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no
longer costs you extra movement.
In addition, when you make a runningjump,
the
distance you cover increases
by a number of feet equal
to your Dexterity modifier.
SUPREME SNEAK
Starting at 9th levei, you have advantage on a Dexterity
(Stealth) check if you move no more than half your
speed on the same turn.
USE MAGIC DEVICE
By 13th leveI, you have learned enough about the
workings of magic that you can improvise the use of
items even when they are not intended for YOU. Vou
ignore ali class, race, and levei requirements
on the use
of magic items.
THIEF'S
REFLEXES
When you reach 17th levei, you have become adept at
laying ambushes
and quickly escaping danger. Vou can
take two turns during the first round of any combat. Vou
take your first turn at your normal initiative and your
second turn at your initiative minus 10. Vou can't use
this feature when you are surprised.
ASSASSIN
Vou focus your training on the grim art of death. Those
who adhere to this archetype
are diverse: hired killers,
spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed
priests trained to exterminate
the enemies of their deity.
Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your
foes with deadly efficiency.
BONUS PROFICIENCIES
When you choose this archetype
at 3rd levei, you gain
proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's
kit.
ASSASSINATE
Starting at 3rd levei, you are at your deadliest when you
get the drop on your enemies. Vou have advantage on
attack rolls against any creature
that hasn't taken a turn
in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against
a creature
that is surprised
is a criticai hit.
INFILTRATION
EXPERTISE
Starting at 9th leveI, you can unfailingly create false
identities for yourself. Vou must spend seven days and
25 gp to establish
the history, profession, and affiliations
for an identity. Vou can't establish an identity that
belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire
appropriate
clothing, letters of introduction, and official-
looking certification to establish yourself as a member of
a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate
yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.
Thereafter,
if you adopt the new identity as a disguise,
other creatures
believe you to be that person until given
an obvious reason not to.
IMPOSTOR
At 13th leveI, you gain the ability to unerringly
mimic
another person's speech, writing, and behavior.
Vou must spend at least three hours studying
these three components
of the person's behavior,
listening to speech, examining
handwriting,
and
observing mannerisms.
Vour ruse is indiscernible
to the casual observer. Ir a
wary creature
suspects something
is amiss, you have
advantage on any Charisma
(Deception) check you make
to avoid detection.
DEATH STRIKE
Starting at 17th leveI, you become a master of instant
death. When you attack and hit a creature
that is
surprised,
it must make a Constitution
saving throw
(DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency
bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your
attack against the creature.
ARCANE TRICKSTER
Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth
and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment
and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and
burglars, but also pranksters,
mischief-makers,
and a
significant number of adventurers.
