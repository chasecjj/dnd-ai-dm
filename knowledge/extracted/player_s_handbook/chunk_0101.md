FEATURE:
DISCOVERY
The quiet seclusion
of your extended
hermitage
gave you
access
to a unique
and powerful
discovery.
The exact
nature
of this revelation
depends
on the nature
of your
seclusion.
It might
be a great
truth
about
the cosmos,
the deities,
the powerful
beings
of the outer
planes,
or
the forces
of nature.
It could
be a site that no one else
has ever seen.
Vou might
have uncovered
a fact that has
long been
forgotten,
or unearthed
some
reli c of the past
that could
rewrite
history.
It might
be information
that
would
be damaging
to the peopJe
who or consigned
you
to exile, and hence
the reason
for your return
to society.
Work with your
DM to determine
the details
of your
discovery
and its impact
on the campaign.
SUGGESTED
CHARACTERISTICS
Some
hermits
are well suited
to a life of seclusion,
whereas
others
chafe
against
it and long for company.
Whether
they embrace
solitude
or long to escape
it, the
solitary
life shapes
their
attitudes
and ideais.
A few are
driven
slightly
mad by their years
apart
from society.
