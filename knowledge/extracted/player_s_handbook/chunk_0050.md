BATTLE MASTER
Those who emulate the archetypal
Battle Master
employ martial techniques passed down through
generations.
To a Battle Master, combat is an academic
field, sometimes
including subjects beyond battle such
as weaponsmithing
and calligraphy. Not every fighter
absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry
that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but
those who do are well-rounded
fighters of great skill
and knowledge.
