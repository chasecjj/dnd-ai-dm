SPELLCASTING
When you reach 3rd levei, you gain the ability to
cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting
and chapter 1i for the wizard spelllisl.
Cantrips.
Vou learn three cantrips: mage hand and
two other cantrips of your choice fram the wizard spell
lisl. Vou learn another wizard cantrip of your choice
at 10th leveI.
Spel1 S/ots. The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting
table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
your spells of 1st levei and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's leveI or
higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example. ifyou know the Ist.level spell charm
person and have a Ist.level and a 2nd.level spell slot
available, you can cast charm person using either slol.
Spel1s Known of 1st.Level and Higher. Vou know
three Ist.level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
you must choose from the enchantment
and iIIusion
spells on the wizard spell lisl.
The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster
Spellcasting
table shows when you learn more wizard
spells of 1st levei ar higher. Each of these spells must
be an enchantment
or illusion spell of your choice, and
must be of a levei for which you have spell slots. For
instance, when you reach 7th levei in this c1ass. you can
learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd leveI.
The spells you learn at 8th. 14th, and 20th levei can
come fram any school of magic.
Whenever you gain a levei in this c1ass, you can
replace one of the wizard spells you know with another
spell of your choice from the wizard spell lisl. The
new spell must be of a levei for which you have spell
slots. and it must be an enchantment
or illusion spell,
unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,
ar 20th leveI.

ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your

designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand
created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on
allack ralls against that creature untilthe

you ar includes you in its area of effect, you can use your
reaction to force the creature
to make a saving thraw

ability modifier. The DC equals
your spell save De. On a failed save, you negate the
spell's effect against you, and you stealthe
knowledge
of the spell if it is at least 1st leveI and of a levei you can
cast (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell). For the next
8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your
