BARBARIAN
A tall human tribesman
strides through a blizzard,
draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he
charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his
people's elk herdo
A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger
to her
authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck
with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivaIs.
Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into
the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored
elbow into the gut of another.
These barbarians,
different as they might be, are
defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable,
and
unthinking
fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger
is the ferocity of a cornered
predator, the unrelenting
assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.
For some, their rage springs from a communion
with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling
reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every
barbarian,
rage is a power that fuels not just a battle
frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and
feats of strength.
PRIMAL INSTINCT
People of towns and cities take pride in how their
civilized ways set them apart from animaIs, as if
denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To
a barbarian,
though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign
of weakness.
The strong embrace their animal nature-
keen instincts, primaI physicality, and ferocious rage.
Barbarians
are uncomfortable
when hedged in by walls
and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands:
the tundra, jungle, or grasslands
where their tribes
live and hunt.
Barbarians
come alive in the chaos of combat.
They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over,
giving them superhuman
strength
and resilience. A
barbarian
can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few
times without resting, but those few rages are usually
sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.
A LIFE
OF DANGER
Not every member of the tribes deemed "barbarians"
by scions of civilized society has the barbarian
c1ass. A
true barbarian
among these people is as uncommon as
a skilled fighter in a town. and he or she plays a similar
role as a protector of the people and a leader in times
of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught
with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying

What led you to take up the adventuring
life? Were you
lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you
join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared
threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you
out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee?
Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to
"civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom.
Or you might have been cast out from your people
because of a crime you committed,
a taboo you violated,
or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

monsters. Barbarians
charge headlong into that danger
so that their people don't have to.
Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians
perfectly suited for adventuring.
Wandering is often a
way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of
the adventurer
is little hardship for a barbarian.
Some
barbarians
miss the close-knit family structures
of the
tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds
formed among the members of their adventuring parties.
When creating a barbarian
character, think about where
your character
comes from and his or her place in the
world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate
origin
for your barbarian.
Did you come from a distant land,
making you a stranger
in the area of the campaign?
Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble
frontier
where barbarians
are common?
