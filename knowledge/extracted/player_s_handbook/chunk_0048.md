PART
1 I CLASSES
FIGHTER
A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield
before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An
elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers
the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisitc
bow. The half-orc nearby shouls orders, helping
lhe lwo combalanls
coordinate
their assault to the
best advantage.
A dwarf in chain mail interposes
his shield between
the ogre's club and his companion,
knocking the dcadly
blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor,
swings two scimitars
in a blinding whirl as she circles
the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.
A gladiator fighls for sport in an arena, a master with
his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving
them around for the crowd's delight-and
his own
tactical advantage. His opponent's sword fiares with
blue light an instant beforc she sends lightning fiashing
forth to smite him.
Ali of these heroes are fighlers, perhaps the most
diverse class of characters
in the worlds of DUNGEONS
&
DRAGONS.
Questing knighls, conquering
overlords, royal
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened
mercenaries,
and bandit kings-as
fighters, they ali share an
unparalleled
mastery with weapons and armor, and a
thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they
are well acquainted
with death, both meting it out and
staring it defiantly in lhe face.
WELL-RoUNDED
SPECIALISTS
Fighters learn the basics of ali combat styles. Every
fighter can swing an axe, fence wilh a rapier, wield a
longsword or a grealsword,
use a bow, and even trap foes
in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighler is
adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that
basic degree of familiarity, each fighler specializes
in a
cerlain style of combat. Some concentrate
on archery,
some on fighting with two weapons aI once, and some
on augmenting
their martial skills with magic. This
combination
of broad general ability and extensive
specialization
makes fighters superior combatants
on battlefields and in dungeons alike.
TRAINED
FOR DANGER
•Nol every member of the cily walch, lhe village mililia,
or the queen's army is a fighter. Mosl of these lroops are
relatively untrained
soldiers wilh only lhe mosl basic
combat knowledge. Veleran soldiers, mililary officers,
lrained bodyguards,
dedicated knighls, and similar
figures are fighlers.

THE FICHTER
Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as
adventurers.
The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and
other dangerous
work common among adventurers
is
second nature for a fighter, not ali that different from
the life he ar she left behind. There are greater risks,
perhaps, but also much greater rewards-few
fighters in
the city watch have the opportunity
to discover a magic
flame tongue sword, for example.
CREATING
A FIGHTER
As you build your fighter, think about two related
elements ofyour character's
background:
Where did
you get your combat training, and what set you apar!
from the mundane warriors
around you? Were you
particularly
ruthless?
Did you get extra help from a
mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication?
What drove you to this training in the first place? A
threat to your homeland, a thirsl for revenge, ar a need
to prove yourself might ali have been factors.
Vou might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's
army ar in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history.
Or you mighl be self-taught-unpolished
but well tested.
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits
of life on a farm, ar are you following a proud family
tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and
armar? They might have been military issue ar family
heirlooms. ar perhaps you scrimped
and saved for years
to buy them. Your armaments
are now among your
most important
possessions-the
only things that stand
between you and death's embrace.
QUICK
BUILD
Vou can make a fighter quickly by following these
suggestions.
first, make Strength
ar Dexterity your
highest ability score, depending
on whether you
want to focus on melee weapons ar on archery (ar
finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be
Constitution,
ar Intelligence if you plan to adopt the
Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose
the soldier background.
