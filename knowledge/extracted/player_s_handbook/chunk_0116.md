TOOLS
A to01helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise
do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or
pick a lock. Your race, c1ass, background,
or feats give
you proficiency with certa in tools. Proficiency with a to01
allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability
check you make using that tool. Too! use is not tied to
a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents
broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM
might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine
detail with your woodcarver's
tools, or a Strength
check
to make something
out of particularly
hard wood.
