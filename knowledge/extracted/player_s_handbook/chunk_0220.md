300 feet in any dimension, and it appears
in an unoc-
cupied space you can see on the ground,
Vou allow up to twenty creatures
that you can see to
regain ali hit points, and you end ali effects on them
described
in the greater restoration spel!.
Vou grant up to ten creatures
that you can see resis-
tance to a damage type you choose.
Vou grant up to ten creatures
you can see immunity to
a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For
instance, you could make yourself and ali your com-
panions immune to a Iich's Iife drain attack.
Vou undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of
any roll made within the last round (including your
last tum). Reality reshapes
itself to accommodate
the
new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an
opponent's successful
save, a foe's criticai hit, or a
friend's failed save. Vou can force the reroll to be made
with advantage or disadvantage,
and you can choose
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
Vou might be able to achieve something
beyond the
scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM
as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in
ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the
wish, the greater the Iikelihood that something
goes
wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire
might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some
unforeseen
consequence
as a result of how you worded
the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead
might propel you forward in time to a period when that
villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from
the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item
or artifact might instantly transport
you to the presence
of the item's current owner.
The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect
other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After
enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until
you finish a long rest, you take IdlO necrotic damage
per leveI of that spel!. This damage can't be reduced or
prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength
drops
to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each
of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing
more than Iight activity, your remaining
recovery time
decreases
by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent
chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you
suffer this stress.

deliberate lie while in the radius. Vou know whether
each creature
succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
An affected creature
is aware of the spell and can thus
avoid answering
questions to which it would normally
respond with alie. Such a creature
can be evasive in
its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries
