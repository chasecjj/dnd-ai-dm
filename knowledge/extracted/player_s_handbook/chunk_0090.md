TIKA
AND
ARTEMIS:
CHARACTER
DETAILS
Consider
how the names
Tika Waylan and Artemis
Entreri
set these
characters
apart from each other and refiect their
personalities.
Tika is a young woman
determined
to prove
that she's not just a kid any more, and her name makes her
sound
young and ordinary. Artemis
Entreri comes
from an
exotic land and carries a more mysterious name.
Tika is nineteen
years old at the start of her adventuring
career and has aubum
hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles,
and a mole on her right hip. Artemis
is a small man, compact
and ali wiry muscle.
He has angular
features
and high
cheekbones,
and he always seems
in need of a shave.
His
raven.black
hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and
Iifeless-betraying
the emptiness
of his life and sou I.

ALIGNMENT
A typical creature
in the worlds of DUNGEONS&
DRAGONShas an alignment, which broadly describes
its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a
combinalion of two factors: one identifies morality
(good, evil, or neutra I),and the olher describes
altitudes
toward society and order (Iawful, chaotie,
or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments
define the
possible combinations.
These brief summaries
of the nine alignments
describe
the typical behavior of a creature with that
alignment.
Individuais might vary significantly from
that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and
consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.
Lawful good (LG) creatures
can be counted on to do
the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons,
paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.
Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help
others according to their needs. Many celestiais, some
e10ud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.
Chaotic good (CG) creatures
act as their conscience
directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper
dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotie good.
Lawful neutra I (LN) individuais act in accordance
with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and
some wizards are lawful neutra!.
Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to
steer e1ear of moral questions and don't take sides,

ALPHABET
doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most
druids, and many humans are neutra!.
Chaotic neutral
(CN) creatures
follow their whims,
holding their personal freedom above ali else.
Many barbarians
and rogues, and some bards, are
chaotie neutra!.
Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they
want, within the limits of acode of tradition, loyalty, or
order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are Jawful evil.
Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do
whatever they can get away with, without compassion
or
qualms. Many drow, some e10ud giants, and yugoloths
are neutra I evi!.
Chaotic evil (CE) creatures
act with arbitrary
violence, spurred
by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.
Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotie evil.
ALIGNMENT
IN THE MULTIVERSE
For many thinking creatures,
alignment is a moral
choice. Humans, dwarves, e1ves, and other humanoid
races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or
evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned
gods who created these races gave them free will to
choose their moral paths, knowing that good without
free will is slavery.
The evil deities who created other races, though, made
those races to serve them. Those races have strong
inborn tendencies
that match the nature of their gods.
Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc
god, Gruumsh. and are thus inelined toward evil. Even if
an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its
innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel
the lingering pull of the orc god's influence.)
Alignment is an essential
pari of the nature of
celestiaIs and fiends. A devil does not choose to be
lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but
rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow
ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.
Most creatures
that lack the capacity for rational
thought do nol have alignments-they
are unaligned.
Such a creature
is incapable of making a moral or
ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature.
Sharks are savage predators,
for example, but they are
not evil; they have no alignment.
