DAMAGE RESISTANCE
AND
VULNERABILITY
Some creatures
and objects are exceedingly difficult or
unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.
lf a creature
or an object has resistance
to a damage
type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a
creature
or an object has vulnerability
to a damage
type, damage of that type is doubled against it.
Resistance
and then vulnerability are applied after
ali other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature
has resistance
to bludgeoning damage and is hit byan
altack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature
is also within a magical aura that reduces ali damage by
5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved,
so the creature
takes 10 damage.
Multiple instances
of resistance
or vulnerability that
affect the same damage type count as only one instance.
For example, if a creature
has resistance
to fire damage
as well as resistance
to ali nonmagical
damage, the
damage of a nonmagical
fire is reduced by half against
the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.
HEALING
Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent.
Even
death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can
restore a creature's
hit points (as explained in chapter
8), and magical methods such as a cure wOllnds spell or
a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.
When a creature
receives healing of any kind, hit
points regained are added to its current hit points. A
creature's
hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum,
so any hit points regained in excess of this number are
lost. For example, a druid granls a ranger 8 hit points of
healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a
hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points
from the druid, not 8.
A creature
that has died can't regain hit points until
magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.
DROPPING
TO O HIT
POINTS
When you drop to O hit points, you either die outright or
fali unconscious,
as explained in the following sections.
INSTANT
DEATH
Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage
reduces you to O hit points and there is damage
remaining, you die if the remaining
damage equals
or exceeds your hit point maximum.
For example, a cleric with a maximum of
12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she
takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced
to O hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because
the remaining
damage equals her hit point
maximum, the cleric dies.
FALLING
UNCONSCIOUS
lf damage reduces you to O hit points and fails to kill
you, you fali unconscious
(see appendix A). This
unconsciousness
ends if you regain any hit points.

When your eurrent

you lypieally show no signs of injury. When
you drop below half your hit point maximum,
you show signs
of wear, sueh as euts and bruises. An attaek that reduees you
to O hit points
strikes you direetly, leaving a bleeding
injury or
other trauma,
or it simply knoeks you uneonseious.

DEATH
SAVING
THROWS
Whenever you start your tum with O hit points, you
must make a special saving throw, called a death saving
throw, to determine
whether you creep closer to death
or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one
isn't tied to any ability score. Vou are in the hands of fate
now, aided only by spells and features that improve your
chances of succeeding
on a saving throw.
Roll a d20. If lhe roll is 10 or higher, you succeed.
Otherwise, you fai!' A success or failure has no effect
by itself. On your third success. you become stable (see
below). On your third failure, you die. The successes
and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track
of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of
both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or
become stable.
Ro/ling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw
and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. lf you
roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.
Damageat OHit Points. lfyou take any damage while
you have O hit points, you suffer a death saving throw
failure. If the damage is from a criticai hit, you suffcr
two failures instead. lf lhe damage equals or exceeds
your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.
STABILIZING
A CREATURE
The best way to save a creature
with O hit points is to
heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature
can at
least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death
saving throw.
Vou can use your action to administer
first aid to an
unconscious
creature
and altempt to stabilize it, which
requires a successful De 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
A stab1e creature
doesn't make death saving throws,
even though it has O hit points, but it does remain
unconscious.
The creature stops being stable, and must
