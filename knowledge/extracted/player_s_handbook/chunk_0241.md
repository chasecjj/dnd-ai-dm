creation, it's time to consider
your next steps. The fun of D&D is in
playing the game, not just making up
characters
(though that's fun, too).
The Starter Set is a great next step if you want to try
your hand at being a Dungeon Master and introduce
your friends to lhe game. lf you don't know any DMs, try
taking on that role yourself. The Starter Set is the best
place to begin your journey.
The D&D basic rules include some of the information
provided in this book, along with the material necessary
to create your own campaign. After absorbing the
Starter Set, check out the D&D basic rules, available as
a free download at DungeonsandDragons.com.
The Monster Manual describes
the most important
monsters in the DUNGEONS& DRAGONSuniverse.
The manual is aimed at DMs, but it's also a useful
reference for players.
The Dungeon Master's Cuide is the ultimate tome
of DM lore. lt includes magic items, optiona! rules,
and guidelines for creating everything from a sim pie
dungeon to an entire cosmos for your campaign.
Each year brings the publication of new D&D
adventures.
These scenarios
and campaigns
are the
perfect way to try your hand at running a D&D game
with a minimum of work.
