Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic
components
of your druid spells, as well as any material
components

bya
spell. Vou gain this benefit in both your normal shape
and your beast shape from Wild Shape,
DRUID
CIRCLES
Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders,
druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring
political borders, Ali druids are nominally members
of this druidic society, though some individuais are so
isolaled lhat lhey have never seen any high-ranking
members of the society or participated
in druidic
gatherings.
Druids recognize each other as brothers and
sislers, Like creatures
of the wilderness,
however, druids
somelimes compete with or even prey on each other,
At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that
share certain perspectives
on nature, balance, and the
way of the druid,
CIRCLE
OF THE LAND
The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages
who safeguard
ancient knowledge and rites through
a vast oral tradition, These druids meet within sacred
circles of trees or standing slones to whisper primai
secrets in Druidic, The circle's wisest members
preside
as the chief priests of communities
lhat hold to the Old
Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk,
As a member of this circle, your magic is inl1uenced
by the land where you were initiated into the circle's
mysterious
rites.
BONUS
CANTRIP
When you choose this circle aI 2nd leveI, you learn one
additional druid cantrip of your choice.
NATURAL
RECOVERY
Starling at 2nd levei, you can regain some of your
magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing
with nature, During a short rest, you choose expended
spell slots to recover. The spell slols can have a
combined levei that is equal to or less lhan half your
druid levei (rounded up), and none of the slots can be
6th levei or higher. Vou can't use this feature again until
you finish a long rest
For example, when YOllare a 4th-levei druid, YOllcan
recover up to two leveis worth of spell slots, Vou can
recover either a 2nd-levei slot or two 1sI-leveI slots,
