FANTASy-HISTORICAL
PANTHEONS
The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons
are
fantasy interpretations
of historical religions from our
world's ancient times. They include deities tha! are
most appropriate
for use in a 0&0 game, divorced from
their historical context in the real world and united into
pantheons
that serve the needs of the game.
THE
CELTlC
PANTHEON
It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of every
soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling
aI night, to the whispering
wind through the pines, to
the unexpected
red of mistletoe on an oak-and
it is in
this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from
the brook and stream, their might heighlened by lhe
strength of the oak and lhe beauty of the woodlands
and
open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to
the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling
in a brook, these gods forced themselves
into being.
The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by
c1erics. for they are c10sely aligned with the forces of
nature lhat druids revere.
THE
GREEK PANTHEON
The gods of Olympus make lhemselves
known wilh the
gentle lap of waves against the shores and lhe crash of
the thunder among the c1oud-enshrouded
peaks. The
thick boar-infested
woods and the sere, olive-covered
hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Everyaspect
of nature echoes with their presence, and they've made
a place for themselves inside the human hearl, 100.
THE
EGYPTIAN
PANTHEON
These gods are a young dynasty of an ancienl divine
family, heirs to the rulership of lhe cosmos and lhe
mainlenance
of the divine principie of Ma'al-lhe
fundamental
order of lrulh, juslice, law, and order lhal
puts gods, mortal pharaohs,
and ordinary men and
women in lhcir logical and rightful place in lhe universe.
The Egyptian panlheon
is unusual in having lhree
gods wilh the Dealh domain of differenl alignmenls.
Anubis is lhe lawful neulral god of lhe aflerlife, who


--- Page 299 ---

judges
lhe souls
of lhe dead.
Set is a chaotic
evil god
of murder,
perhaps
besl known
for killing
his brother
Osiris.
And Nephlhys
is a chaolic
good goddess
of
mourning.
Thus,
allhough
most c1erics of lhe Dealh
domain
(found
in lhe Dungeon Master's Cuide) are
villainous
characlers,
c1erics who serve
Anubis
or
Nephlhys
need
nol be.
THE NORSE PANTHEON
Where
lhe land plummels
from the snowy
hills inlo lhe
icy fjords below, where
lhe longboals
draw
up on lo lhe
beach,
where
the glaciers
flow forward
and relreal
wilh
every fali and spring-lhis
is lhe land of the Vikings,
the home
of lhe Norse
panlheon.
It's a brulal
clime,
and one lhal calls
for brulalliving.
The warriors
of
the land have had lo adapl
lo lhe harsh
condilions
in
order
lO survive,
but lhey haven't
been
100 lwisled
by
CELTIC
DEITIES
lhe needs
of lheir
environment.
Given lhe necessity
of
raiding
for food and wealth,
il's surprising
lhe mortais
lurned
out as well as lhey did. Their
powers
reflecl
the need
lhese
warriors
had for slrong
leadership
and
decisive
action.
Thus,
lhey see lheir
deities
in every
bend
of a river, hear
them
in lhe crash
of lhe thunder
and lhe booming
of lhe glaciers,
and smell
them
in lhe
smoke
of a burning
longhouse.
The Norse
pantheon
includes
two main
families,
the
Aesir
(deilies
of war and destiny)
and lhe Vanir (gods
of ferlilily
and prosperily).
Once
enemies,
these
lwo
families
are now c10sely allied
againsl
lheir common
enemies,
the gianls
(including
lhe gods Surlur
and
Thrym).
Like lhe gods of Greyhawk,
gods in different
families
somelimes
have overlap
in their spheres
of
influence:
Frey (of lhe Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir)
are both associated
with lhe sun, for example.
