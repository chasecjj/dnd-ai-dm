"I HAVE NEVER IMAGINED
SUCH BEAUTY EXISTED,"
Goldmoon said soft!)'.The day's march had been difficult.
but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams.
The companions stood on a high cliff over thefabled
city of Qualinost.
Fourslender spires rasefrom the city's corners likeglisten-
ingspindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining
silver. Graceful arches. swoopingfrom
spire to spire, soared
through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths.
they were strongenough
to hold the weight of an army,yet
they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might
overthraw the balance, These glistening arches were the
city's on!)' boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost.
The elven city opened its arms loving!)' to the wilderness.

Elves are a magical people of otherworldly
grace, living
in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in
places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests
ar in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where
soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances
waft on the breeze. Elves lave nature and magic, art
and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things
of the world.
SLENDER
AND GRACEFUL
With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves
appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members
of many other races. They are slightly shorter than
humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet
tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than
humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and
females are about the same height, and males are only
marginaIly heavier than females.
Elves' coloration encompasses
the normal human
range and also includes skin in shades of copper,
bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green ar blue,
and eyes like pools of liquid gold ar silver. Elves have no
facial and little body hair. They favor elegant c10thing in
bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovelyjewelry,
A TIMELESS
PERSPECTIVE
Elves can live weIl over 700 years, giving them a broad
perspective
on events that might trouble the shorter-
lived races more deeply, They are more often amused
than excited, and more likely to be curious than
greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty
happenstance.

adventuring
on a mission or learning a new skill or art,
elves can be focused and relentless.
They are slow to
make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget
them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to
serious insults with vengeance.
Like the branches
of a young tree, elves are f1exible
in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and
compromise
to resolve differences before they escalate
to violence. They have been known to retreat from
intrusions
into their woodland homes, confident
that they can simply wait the invaders oul. But when
the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side,
demonstrating
skill wilh sword, bow, and strategy.
HIDDEN
WOODLAND
REALMS
Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among
the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow
vegetables, and their skill and magie allow them to
support themselves without the need for clearing and
plowing land. They are talented artisans,
crafting finely
worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with
outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a
good living by trading crafted items for metais (which
thcy have no interest in mining).
Elves encountered
outside their own lands are
commonly traveling minstrels,
artists, or sages. Human
nobles compete for lhe services of elf instructors
to
teach swordplay or magie to their children.

AND ADVENTURE

Since
they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries
of
exploration and discovery. They dislike lhe pace of

that let them travei freely and set their own pace. Elves

ELF NAMES
Elves are considered
children until they declare
themselves
adults, some time after the hundredth
birthday, and before this period they are called
by child names.
On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name,
although those who knew him or her as a youngster
mlght continue to use the child name. Each elf's adult
na me is a uni que creation, though It might reflect
the names of respected
individuaIs or other family
members.
Little distinction exists between male
names and female names; the groupings here reflect
only general tendencies.
In addition, every elf bears a
family na me, typieally a comblnation
of other Elvish
words. Some elves traveling among humans translate
their family names into Common, but others retain the
Elvish version.
