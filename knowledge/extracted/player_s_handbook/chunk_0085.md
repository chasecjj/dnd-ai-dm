SPELL RESISTANCE
Starting
at 14th leveI, you have advantage on saving
throws against spells.
Furthermore,
you have resistance
against the
damage of spells.
SCHOOL OF CONJURATION
As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects
and creatures
out of thin air. Vou can conjure billowing
clouds of killing fog or summon creatures
from
elsewhere
to fight on your behalf. As your mastery
grows, you learn spells of transportation
and can
teleport yourself across vast distances,
even to other
planes of existence, in an instan!.

gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell
into your spellbook is halved.
MINOR

at 2nd leveI when you select this school, you
can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object
in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space
that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be
no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than
10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical
PART I I CLASSES
object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical,
radiating dim light out to 5 fee!.
The object disappears
after 1 hour, when you use this
feature again, or if it takes any damage.
BENIGN TRANSPOSITION
Starting
at 6th leveI, you can use your action to teleport
up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.
Alternatively, you can choose a space within range
that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature.
]f that
creature
is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of
1st levei or higher.
FOCUSED CONJURATION
Beginning at 10th leveI, while you are concentrating
on
a conjuration spell, your concentration
can't be broken
as a result of taking damage.
DURABLE
SUMMONS
Starting
at 14th leveI, any creature
that you
summon or create with a conjuration
spell has 30
temporary
hit points.
SCHOOL OF DIVINATION
The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and
commoners
alike, for ali seek a clearer understanding
of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive
to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness
so
that you can see clearly. Vou work to master spells of
discernment,
remote viewing, supernatural
knowledge,
and foresight.

Starting at 2nd levei when you choose this school,
glimpses of the future begin to press in on your
awareness.
When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s
and record the numbers
rolled. Vou can replace any
attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or
a creature
that you can see with one of these foretelling
rolls. Vou must choose to do so before the roll, and you
can replace a roll in this way only once per turno
Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you
finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
EXPERT DIVINATION
Beginning at 6th leveI, casting divination spells comes
so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your
spellcasting
efforts. When you cast a divination spell
of 2nd leveI or higher using a spell slot, you regain one
expended spell slo!. The slot you regain must be of a
levellower
than the spell you cast and can't be higher
than 5th leveI.
