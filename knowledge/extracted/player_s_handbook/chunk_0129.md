is holding dosed.
In situations like these, the outcome
is determined
bya special form of ability check,
called a contest.
Both participants
in a contest make ability checks
appropriate
to their efforts. They apply ali appropriate
bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing
the
total to a DC, they compare the totaIs of their two
checks. The participant
with the higher check total wins
the contest. That character
ar monster either succeeds
at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.
If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the
same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant
might win the contest by default. If two characters
tie in
a contest to snatch a ring off the fioor, neither character
grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open
a doar and an adventurer
trying to keep the doar dosed,
a tie means that the door remains shut.
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities,
induding
skills that a character
or a monster can be
proficient in. A skill represents
a specific aspect of an
ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill
demonstrates
a focus on that aspect. (A character's
starting skill proficiencies are determined
at character
creation, and a monster's
skill proficiencies appear in
the monster's stat block.)
For example, a Dexterity check might refiect a
character's
attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to paIm
an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of
Dexterity has an associated
skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of
Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character
who has
proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly
good at
Dexterity checks related to sneaking
and hiding.
The skills related to each ability score are shown in
the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.)
See an ability's description
in the later sections of this
chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated
with an ability.
before you apply it. For example, the rogue's Expertise
feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability
checks. If a circumstance
suggests that your proficiency
bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still
add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.
By the same token, if a feature ar effect allows you
to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an
ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your
proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the
check. For that check your proficiency bonus is O, given
the fact that multiplying O by any number is still O. For
instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill,
you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double
your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence
(History) checks.
In general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus
for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature ar effect
allows you to do so, these same rules apply.
ABILITY
CHECKS
An ahility check tests a character's
ar monster's
innate
talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge.
The DM calls for an ability check when a character
ar
monster attempts an aclion (other than an attack) that
has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain,
the dice determine
the results.
For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six
abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty
of the task, represented
bya Difficulty Class. The more
difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty
Classes table shows the most common DCs.

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the
relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply
bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the De.
If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check
is a success-the
creature
overcomes the challenge
at hand. Otherwise,
it's a failure, which means the
character
or monster makes no progress
toward the
objective ar makes progress combined with a setback
determined
by the DM.

Sometimes
one character's
or monster's efforts are
directly apposed to another's.
This can accur when both
of them are trying to do the same thing and only one
can succeed, such as attempting
to snatch up a magic
ring that has fallen on the fioor. This situation also
applies when ane of them is trying to prevent the other
one from accomplishing
a goal-for
example, when a
monster tries to force open a doar that an adventurer

SCORES
Sometimes,
the DM might ask for an ability check
using a specific skill-for
example, "Make a Wisdom
(Perception)
check." At other times, a player might ask
the DM if proficiency in a particular
skill applies to a
check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an
individual can add his ar her proficiency bonus to ability
checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the
skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.
