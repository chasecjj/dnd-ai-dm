CHARLATAN
Vou have always
had a way with people.
Vou know
what
makes
them
tick. you can tease
out their
hearts'
desires
after a few minutes
of conversation,
and with a
few leading
questions
you can read
them
like they were
children's
books.
!t's a useful
talent,
and one that you're
perfectly
willing
to use for your advantage.
Vou know what
people
want
and you deliver.
or rather,
you promise
to deliver.
Common
sense
should
steer
people
away from things
that sound
toa good to be true,
but common
sense
seems
to be in short
supply
when
you're
around.
The bottle
of pink-colored
liquid will
surely
cure
that unseemly
rash,
this ointment-nothing
more
than
a bit of fat with a sprinkle
of silver
dust-can
restore
youth
and vigor, and there's
a bridge
in the city
thatjust
happens
to be for sale. These
marvels
sound
implausible,
but you make
them
sound
like the real dea!.

Scam
1
I cheat at games of chance.
2
I shave coins or forge documents.
3
I insinuate myselfinto
people's
lives to prey on their
weakness and secure their fortunes.
4
I put on new identities like clothes.
S
I run sleight-of.hand
cons on street corners.
6
I convince people that worthless junk is worth their
hard.earned
money.
FEATURE:
FALSE IDENTITY
Vou have created
a second
identity
that includes
documentation,
established
acquaintallces,
and
disguises
that allow you to assume
that persona.
Additionally,
you can forge documents
including
official
papers
and personal
letters,
as long as you have seen
an
example
of the kind of document
or the handwriting
you
are trying
to copy.
SUGGESTED
CHARACTERISTICS
Charlatans
are colorful
characters
who conceal
their
true selves
behind
the masks
they construcl.
They
reflect
what people
want
to see, what they want
to
believe,
and how they scc the world.
But their
true
sclves
are sometimes
plagued
by an uneasy
conscience,
a n old enemy,
or deep-seated
trust
issues.
