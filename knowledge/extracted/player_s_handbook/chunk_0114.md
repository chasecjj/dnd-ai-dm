the alchemist's tire as an improvised weapon. On a
hit, the target takes Id4 tire damage at the start of
each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by
using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to
extinguish the liames.
Antitoxin. A creature that drinks this viaIof liquid
gains advantage on saving throws against poison for I
hour. lt confers no benetit to undead or constructs.
Arcane Focus. An arcane focus is a special item-
an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff,
a wand.like length ofwood, or some similar item-
designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a
spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10.
Bal/ Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny
metal balls from their pouch to cover a levei area 10
feet square. A creature moving across the covered area
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fali
prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed
doesn't need to make the saving throw.
Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable
threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a
block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the
weight you can normally lift.
Book. A book might contain poetry, historical
accounts, information pertaining to a particular tield
of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions,
or just about anything else that can be represented
using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook
(described later in this section).
Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a single bag
of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature
that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or stop moving and take I piercing
damage. Unti! the creature regains at least I hit point,
its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature
moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to
make the saving throw.
Candle. For I hour, a candle sheds bright light in a
5.foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up
to twenty crossbow bolts.
Case, Map or Scrol/. This cylindricalleather
case can
hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or tive rolled-up
sheets of parchment.
Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. lt can be burst with a
successful DC 20 Strength check.
Climber's Kit. A climber's kit includes special pitons,
boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the
climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you
do, you can't fali more than 25 feet from the point where
you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25
feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.
Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small,
watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments
to hold ali the material components and other special
items you need to cast your spells, except for those
components that have a specitic cost (as indicated in a
spell's description).
Crowbar. Using a crowbar granls advantage
to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage
can be applied.
Druidic Focus. A druidic focus might be a sprig of
mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or
another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living
tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones,
and teeth from sacred animaIs. A druid can use such an
object as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10.
Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken
line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet
lures, and narrow netting.
Healer's Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing
bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As
an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize
a creature that has O hit points, without needing to make
a Wisdom (Medicine) check.
Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of
a god or pantheon. lt might be an amulet depicting a
symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully
engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny
box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix B
lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods
in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy
symbol as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter
lO. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it
in hand, wear it visibly,or bear it on a shield.
Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents
of this lIask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw
it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case,
make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating
the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is
a tiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.
