the location you targeted, you automatically
miss, but
the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not
whether you guessed the target's location correctly.
When a creature
can't see you, you have advantage on
attack rolls against il.
lf you are hidden-both
unseen and unheard-when
you make an attack, you give away your location when
the attack hits or misses.
RANGED ATTACKS
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a
crossbow, huri a handaxe, or otherwise
send projectiles
to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot
spines from its taii. Many spells also involve making a
ranged atlack.
RANGE
Vou can make ranged attacks only against targets within
a specified range.
If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a
single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.
Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a
longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller
number is the normal range, and the larger number is
the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage
when
your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack
a target beyond the long range.
RANGED ATTACKS
IN CLOSE
COMBAT
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe
is next to you. When you make a ranged atlack with
a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have
disadvantage
on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet
of a hostil e creature who can see you and who isn't
incapacitated.
MELEE ATTACKS
Used in hand-to-hand
combat, a meIee atlack allows
you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack
typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword,
a warhammer,
or an axe. A typical monster makes a
melee attack when it strikes with its daws, horns, teeth,
tentades,
or other body parI. A few spells also involve
making a mele e atlack.
Most creatures
have a 5-foot reach and can thus
attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a
melee attack. Certain creatures
(typically those larger
than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach
than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.
When you are unarmed,
you can fight in melee by
making an unarmed
strike, as shown in the weapon
table in chapter 5.
OPPORTUNITY
ATTACKS
In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies
to drop their guardo Vou can rarely move heedlessly past
your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so
provokes an opportunity
attack.
Vou can make an opportunity
attack when a hostile
creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To
make the opportunity
attack, you use your reaction
to make one melee atlack against the provoking

CONTESTS
IN COMBAT
Sattle often involves pítting your prowess against that of
your foe. Such a challenge is represented
by a contes!. This
section includes the most common contests that require an
actíon in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM
can use these contests as models for improvising others.

creature. The atlack interrupts
the provoking creature's
movement, occurring
right before the creature
leaves your reach.
Vou can avoid provoking an opportunity
attack by
taking the Disengage action. Vou also don't provoke an
opportunity
attack when you teleport or when someone
or something
moves you without using your movement,
action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an
opportunity
atlack if an explosion huris you out of a foe's
reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.
TWO-WEAPON
FIGHTING
When you take the Attack action and attack with a light
melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can
use a bonus action to atlack with a different light melee
weapon that you're holding in the other hand. Vou don't
add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus
atlack, unless that modifier is negative.
If either weapon has the thrown property, you
can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee
atlack with il.
GRAPPLING
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it,
you can use the Attack action to make a special melee
attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks
with the Atlack action, this atlack replaces one of them.
The target of your grapple must be no more than one
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.
Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target
by making a grapple check, a Strength
(Athletics)
check contested by the target's Strength
(Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the
ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to
the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition
specifies the things that end it, and you can release the
target whenever you like (no action required).
Escaping
a Grapple. A grappled creature
can use its
action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by
your Strength
(Athletics) check.
Moving a Grappled
Creature.
When you move, you
can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but
your speed is halved, unless the creature
is two or more
sizes smaller than you.
SHOVING
A CREATURE
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee
atlack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or
push it away from you. Ifyou're able to make multiple
atlacks with the Attack action, this atlack replaces
one ofthem.
The target of your shove must bc no more than one
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.
Vou make a Strength
(Athletics) check contested by the
target's Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
