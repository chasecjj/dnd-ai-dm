Vou don't need to be confined to binary notions of
sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian
is often
seen as androgynous
or hermaphroditic,
for example,
and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon's
image. Vou could also play a female character
who
presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a
female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being
mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character's
sexual
orientation
is for you to decide.
CHAPTER
4: PERSONALITY
AND BACKGROUND
~
HARACTERS ARE DEFINED BY MUCH MORE THAN
their race and c1ass. They're individuais with
their own stories, interests, connections,
and
capabilities beyond those that c1ass and race
define. This chapter expounds on the details
that distinguish
characters
from one another,
including the basics of name and physical description,
the rules of backgrounds
and languages,
and the finer
points of personality and alignment.

Your character's
race description
includes sample
names for members of that race. Put some thought into
your name even ifyou're just picking one from a list.
Your character's
name and physical description
might
be the first things that the other players at the table
learn about you. !t's worth thinking about how these
characteristics
reflect the character you have in mind.

Vou can decide your character's
height and weight,
using the information
provided in your race description
or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about
what your character's
ability scores might say about his
or her height and weight. A weak but agile character
might be thin. A strong and tough character
might be
tall or just heavy.
If you want to, you can roll randomly for your
character's
height and weight using the Random Height
and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height
Modifier column determines
the character's
extra
height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same
number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in
the Weight Modifier column determines
the character's
extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.
For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8
inches plus 2dlO inches. Her player rolls 2dlO and gets
a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tal I. Then
the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by
2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra
36 pounds (12 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a
total of 146 pounds.
Vou choose your character's
age and the color of
his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of
distinctiveness,
you might want to give your character
an unusual or memorable physical characteristic,
such
as a scar, a limp, or a tatlOo.

CONTRASTING
CHARACTERS
The details
in this chapter
make a big difference
in setting
your character
apart from every other character.
Consider
the
following two human
fighters.
Hailing from the Dragonlance
setting,
Tika Waylan was a
brash teenager
who had a rough childhood.
The daughter
of
a thief, she ran away from home and practiced
her father's
trade on the streets
of Solace. When she tried to rob the
proprietor
of the Inn of the Last Home,
he caught
her and
took her under
his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid.
Sut
when the dragonarmies
laid waste to the town ofSolace
and destroyed
the inn, necessity
forced Tika into adventure
alongside
the friends
she'd
known from her childhood.
Her
skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains
one ofher
favorite
weapons)
combined
with her history on the streets
gave her
skills invaluable
in her adventuring
career.
Artemis
Entrer; grew up on the streets
of Calimport
in the
Forgotten
Realms.
He used his wits, strength,
and agility
to carve out his own territory
in one of the city's hundreds
of poor shanty towns.
After several years, he attracted
the
notice of one ofthe
most
powerful
thieves'
guilds in the city,
and he ascended
the ranks ofthe
guild quickly despite
his
youth. Artemis
became
the favored assassin
of one ofthe
city's pashas,
who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover
some
stolen
gems.
He's a professional
killer, constantly
challenging
himselfto
improve
his skills.
Tika and Artemis
are both human
and both fighters
(with
some experience
as rogues),
possessing
similarly high
Strength
and Dexterity scores,
but there the similarity
ends.
Vou can play a male or female character
without gaining
any special benefits or hindrances.
Think about how
your character
does or does not conform to the broader
cu!ture's expectations
of sex, gender, and sexual
behavior. For example, a male drow c1eric defies the
traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could
be a reason for your character
to leave that society and
come to the surface.
