Vour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of
the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality,
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
scores. Vou
also retain ali of your skill and saving throw proficien-
cies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.
If
the creature
has the same proficiency as you and the
bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the
creature's
bonus instead of yours. lf the creature
has
any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
When you transform, you assume the beast's hit
points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal
form, you return to the number of hit points you had
before you transformed.
However, if you rever! as a
result of dropping to Ohit points, any excess damage
carries over to your normal formo For example, if you
take lO damage in animal form and have only 1 hit
point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as
the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form
to Ohit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
Vou can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or
take any action that requires hands is limited to the
capabilities
of your beast formo Transforming
doesn't
break your concentration
on a spell you've already
cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that
are part of a spell, such as caJl Jightning, that you've
already cast.
Vou retain the benefit of any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them if the new
form is physically capable of doing so. However, you
can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvi-
sion, unless your new form also has that sense.
Vou choose whether your equipment falls to the
ground in your space, merges into your new form, or
is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal,
but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new
form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the crea-
ture's shape and size. Vour equipment doesn't change
size or shape to match the new
form, and any equipment that
the new form can't wear
must either fali to the
ground or merge with it.
Equipment that merges
with the form has no
effect until you leave
the formo
DRUID
CIRCLE
At 2nd levei, you choose to
identify with a circle of druids:
the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both
detailed at the end of the class description.
Vour choice
grants you features at 2nd levcl and again at 6th, 10th,
and 14th leveI.
ABILITY
SCORE IMPROVEMENT
When you reach 4th levei, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th leveI, you can increase one ability score of
your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores
of your choicc by 1. As normal, you can't increase an
ability score above 20 using this feature.
TIMELESS
BODY
Starting at 18th leveI, the primaI magic that you wield
causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that
pass, your body ages only 1 year.
BEAST SPELLS
Beginning at 18th leveI, you can cast many of your druid
spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. Vou
can perform the somatic and verbal components
of a
druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to
provide material components.
ARCHDRUID
At 20th levei, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited
number of times.
