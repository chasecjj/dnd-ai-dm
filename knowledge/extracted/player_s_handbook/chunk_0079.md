HURL THROUGH
HELL
Starting
at 14th leveI, when you hit a creature with an
attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport
the target through the lower planes. The creature
disappears
and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.
At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the
space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied
space. ]f the target is not a fiend, it takes IOdlO psychic
damage as it reels from its horrific experience.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a long rest.
FIENDISH
RESILIENCE
Starting at 10th leveI, you can choose one damage type
when you finish a short or long rest. Vou gain resistance
to that damage type until you choose a different one
with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or
silver weapons ignores this resistance.
DARK ONE'S
OWN
LUCK
Starting at 6th leveI, you can call on your patron to alter
fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a
saving throw, you can use this feature to add a dlO to
your roll. Vou can do so after seeing the initial roll but
before any of the roll's effects occur.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
FEY PRESENCE
Starting at 1st leveI, your patron bestows upon you the
ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence
of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature
in
a 10-foot cube originating
from you to make a Wisdom
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The
creatures
that fail their saving throws are ali charmed
or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of
your next turno
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
DARK DELIRIUM
Starting
at 14th leveI, you can plunge a creature
into
an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature
that you can see within 60 feet of YOU.It must make a
Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save
DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you
(your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration
is broken (as if you are concentrating
on a spell). This
effect ends early if the creature
takes any damage.
Until this illusion ends, the creature
thinks it is lost
in a misty realm, the appearance
of which you choose.
The creature
can see and hear only itself, you, and
the illusion.
Vou must finish a short or long rest before you can
use this feature again.
BEGUILING
DEFENSES
Beginning at 10th levei, your patron teaches you how to
turn the mind-affecting
magic of your enemies against
them. Vou are immune to being charmed, and when
another creature
attempts to charm you, you can use
your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on
that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or
be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature
takes any damage.
MISTY
ESCAPE
Starting at 6th leveI, you can vanish in a puff of mist in
response to harm. When you take damage, you can use
your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet
to an unoccupied space you can see. Vou remain invisible
until the start of your next turn or until you attack or
cast a spell.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
THE FIEND
Vou have made a pact with a fiend from the lower
planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil,
even if you strive against those aims. Such beings
desire the corruption
or destruction
of ali things,
ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to
forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon,
Orcus, Fraz'Urb-Iuu, and Baphomet; archdevils such
as Asmodeus,
Dispater, Mephistopheles,
and Belial;
pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and
ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.
Vour patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is
utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from
the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be
one of the elder gods known only in legends. [ts motives
are incomprehensible
to mortaIs, and its knowledge so
immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries
pale in comparison
to the vast secrets it holds. The
Great Old One might be unaware of your existence
or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets YOllhave
learned allow YOllto draw YOllrmagic from it.
Entities of this type inclllde Ghallnadar, called That
Which Lllrks; Tharizdun,
the Chained God; Dendar, the
Night Serpent; Zargon, the Retllrner; Great Cthlllhll;
and other unfathomable
beings.
