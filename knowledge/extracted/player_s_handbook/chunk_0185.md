half as much damage on a successful

Vou touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy
(or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60
feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area
already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area
is subject to the following effects.
First, celestiais, elementals,
fey, fiends, and undead
can't enter the area, nor can such creatures
charm,
frighten, or possess creatures
within it. Any creature
charmed,
frightened, or possessed
by such a creature
is no longer charmed,
frightened, or possessed
upon
entering the area. Vou can exclude one or more of those
types of creatures
from this effect.
Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area.
Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an
effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects apply to
creatures
in the area; you can designate whether the
effect applies to ali creatures,
creatures
that follow a
specific deity or leader, or creatures
of a specific sort,
such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be
affected enters the spell's area for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma
saving throw. On a success, the creature
ignores the
extra effect until it leaves the area.
Courage. Affected creatures
can't be frightened
while in the area.
Darkness.
Darkness
fills the area. Normallight,
as well as magicallight
created by spells of a lower
levei than the slot you used to cast this spell, can't
illuminate the area.
DayJight. Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness
created by spells of a lower levei than the slot you used
to cast this spell can't extinguish the light.
Energy Protection.
Affected creatures
in the area
have resistance
to one damage type of your choice,
except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
Energy
VuInerabiJity. Affected creatures
in the area
have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice,
except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

or by

while in the area.

HALLUCINATORY
TERRAIN
4th-levei iIIusion
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 300 feet
Components:
V,S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit
of green plant)
Duration:
24 hours
Vou make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range
look, sound, and smelllike
some other sort of natural
terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to
resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult
or impassable
terrain. A pond can be made to seem
like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope,
or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
Manufactured
structures,
equipment, and creatures
within the area aren't changed in appearance.
The tactile characteristics
of the terrain are
unchanged,
so creatures
entering the area are likely to
see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious
by touch, a creature
carefully examining the illusion can
atlempt an Intelligence (lnvestigation)
check against
your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature
who
discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague
image superimposed
on the terrain.
HARM
6th-levei necromancy
Casting Time: I action
Range: 60 feet
Components:
V, S
Duration:
Instantaneous
Vou unleash a virulent disease on a creature
that
you can see within range. The target must make a
Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, it takes
14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a
successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's
hit points below I. ]f the target fails the saving throw,
its hit point maximum is reduced for I hour byan
amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect
that removes a disease allows a creature's
hit point
maximum to return to normal before that time passes,
