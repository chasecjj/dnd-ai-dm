Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land
vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a
waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel
(see chapter 5), and they don't suffer penalties for a fast
pace or gain benefits from a slow pace, Depending on
the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able
to travei for up to 24 hours per day,
Certain speciai mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon,
or special vehicles, such as a carpet of f!ying, allow you
to traveI more swiftly, The Dungeon Master's Cuide
contains more information on special methods of traveI.

(no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as
a hedge or low wall. Otherwise. you hit it.
When you land in difficult terrain. you must succeed
on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your
feet. Otherwise. you land prone.
HighJump.
When you make a high jump. you leap
into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength
modifier ifyou move at least 10 feet on foot immediately
before the jump. When you make a standing high jump,
you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each
foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In
some circumstances. your DM might allow you to make
a Strength (Athletics) check tojump higher than you
normally cano
Voucan extend your arms half your height above
yourself during the jump. Thus. you can reach above
you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1Vi
times your height.

TERRAIN
The traveI speeds given in the Travei Pace table
assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains,
or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face
dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep
mountains, and ice-covered ground-all
considered
difficult terrain.

1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed-so

an hour, or a day.
SPECIAL TYPES OF MOVEMENT
Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness
areas often involves more than simply walking.
Adventurers might have to climb, crawl. swim, or jump
to get where they need to go.
CUMBING,
SWIMMING.
AND CRAWUNG
While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement
costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain). unless
a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the
DM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or
one with few handholds requires a successful Strength
(Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in
rough water might require a successful Strength
(Athletics) check.
jUMPING
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.
LongJump.
When you make a 10ngjump. you cover a
number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at
leasl 10 feet 011fool immedialely before the jump. When
you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half
that distance. Eilher way, each fool you clear on the
jump costs a foot of movement.
This rule assumes that the heighl of your jump
doesn't maller. such as a jump across a stream or
chasm. Atyour DM's option, you must succeed on a
PART 2 I ADVENTURINO
As adventurers travei through a dungeon or the
wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and
some characters might perform other tasks to help
the group's journey.
MARCHING
ORDER
The adventurers should establish a marching order.
A marching order makes it easier to determine which
characters are affected by traps. which ones can spot
hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those
enemies when a fight breaks out.
A character might occupy the front rank. one or more
middle ranks. or the back rank. Characters in the front
and back ranks need enough room to travei side by
side with others in their rank. When space is toa tight,
the marching order must change, usually by moving
characters to a middle rank.
Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party
arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they
are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one rank,
it's considered a front rank.
STEALTH
While traveling at a slow pace. the characters can move
stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try
to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.
See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.
NOTICING
THREATS
Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the
characters to determine whether anyone in the group
notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a
threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular
rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a
maze of tunnels. the DM might decide that only those
characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or
spot a stealthy creature following the group, while
characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.
While traveling at a fast pace. characters take a -5
penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores
to notice hidden threats.
