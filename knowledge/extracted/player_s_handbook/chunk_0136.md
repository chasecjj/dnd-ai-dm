darkness
as if the darkness
were dim light, so areas
of darkness
are only lightly obscured as far as that
creature
is concerned.
However, the creature can't
discern color in darkness,
only shades of gray.
TRUESIGHT
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range,
see in normal and magical darkness,
see invisible
creatures
and objects, automatically detect visual
illusions and succeed on saving throws against them,
and perceives the original form of a shapechanger
or
a creature
that is transformed
by magic. Furthermore,
the creature can see into the Ethereal
Plane.
FOOD AND WATER
Characters
who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of
exhaustion
(see appendix A). Exhaustion
caused by lack
of food or water can't be removed until the character
eats and drinks the full required amount.
FOOD
A character
needs one pound of food per day and can
make food last longer by subsisting
on half rations.
Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day
without food.
A character
can go without food for a number of days
equal to 3 + his or her Constitution
modifier (minimum
I). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character
automatically suffers one levei of exhaustion.
A normal day of eating resets the count of days
without food to zero.
WATER
A character
needs one gallon of water per day, or two
gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character
who
drinks only half that much water must succeed on a
DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or suffer one leveI of
exhaustion
at the end of the day. A character
with access
to even Icss watcr automatically suffers one levei of
exhaustion
at the end of the day.
If the character
already has one or more leveis of
exhaustion,
the character
takes two leveis in either case.
INTERACTING
WITH OBJECTS
A character's
interaction with objects in an environment
is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells
the DM that his or her character
is doing something,
such a moving a lever, and the DM describes
what, if
anything happens.
For example, a character
might decide to pull a lever,
which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to
fiood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall.
If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character
might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might
call for a Strength
check to see whether the character
can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for
any such check based on the difficulty of the task.
Characters
can also damage objects with their
weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and
psychic damage, but otherwise
they can be affected
by physical and magical attacks much like creatures
cano The DM determines
an object's Armor Class and
hit points, and might decide that certain objects have
resistance
or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (lt's
hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects
always fail Strength
and Dexterity saving throws, and
they are immune to effects that require other saves.
When an object drops to O hit points, it breaks.
A character
can also attempt a Strength
check to
break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.
SOCIAL
INTERACTION
Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying
monsters are key parts of D&D adventures.
No less
important,
though, are the social interactions
that
adventurers
have with other inhabitants
of the world.
Interaction
takes on many forms. Vou might need
to convince an unscrupulous
thief to confess to some
malfeasance,
or you might try to fialter a dragon so that
it will spare your life. The DM assumes
the roles of any
characters
who are participating
in the interaction that
don't belong to another player at the table. Any such
character
is called a nonplayer
character
(NPC).
In general terms, an NPC's altitude toward you is
described
as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly
NPCs are predisposed
to help you, and hostile ones are
inclined to get in your way. It's easier to get what you
want from a friendly NPC, of course.
Social interactions
have two primary aspects:
roleplaying and ability checks.
ROLEPLAYING
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.
In this case, it'syou as a player determining
how your
character
thinks, acts, and talks.
Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game,
and it comes to the fore during social interactions.
Your character's
quirks, mannerisms,
and personality
infiuence how interactions
resolve.
There are two styles you can use when roleplaying
your character: the descriptive approach and the active
approach. Most players use a combination
of the two
styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for YOU.
DESCRIPTIVE
ApPROACH
TO ROLEPLAYING
With this approach, you describe your character's
words
and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on
your mental image of your character, you tell everyone
what your character
does and how he or she does it.
For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek
has a quick tem per and blames the elves of the
Cloakwood for his family's misfortune. At a tavern. an
obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek's table and tries to
strike up a conversation
with the dwarf.
Chris says, "Tordek spits on the fioor, growls an
insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits
on a stool and glares at the minstrei before ordering
another drink."
In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek's mood
and given the DM a clear idca of his character's
altitude and actions.
