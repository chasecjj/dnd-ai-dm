perpendicular
to it at the points you choose. A ring is
visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side
that functions as a portal.
Any creature
or object entering the portal exits from
the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each
other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side
has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque
and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can
rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side
faces in a different direction.

password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object,

impassable
until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or
suppressed.
Casting knock on the object suppresses
arcane lock for 10 minutes.

Special
Vou and up to eight willing creatures
within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the
spell fails and the casting is wasted ifyou are already
on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
unconscious
and in a state of suspended
animation; it
doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.
Your astral body resembles your mortal form in
almost every way, replicating your game statistics and
possessions.
The principal difference is the addition of
a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder
blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 fool. This cord is your tether to your material body. As
long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way
home. If the cord is cut-something
that can happen
only when an effect specifically states that it does-your
soul and body are separated,
killing you instantly.
Your astral form can freely travei through the Astral
Plane and can pass through portais there leading to any
other plane. Ifyou enter a new plane or return to the
plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and
possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing
you to re-enter your body as you ente r the new plane.
Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage
or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your
physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your companions
when
you use your action to dismiss il. When the spell ends,
the affected creature
returns to its physical body,
and it awakens.
The spell might also end early for you or one of your
companions.
A successful
dispel magic spell used
against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
creature. If a creature's
original body or its astral form
drops to Ohit points, the spell ends for that creature.
If
the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls
the creature's
astral form back to its body, ending its
state of suspended
animation.
If you are returned
to your body prematurely, your
companions
remain in their astral forms and must find
their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping
to Ohit points.
