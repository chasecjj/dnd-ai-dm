DWARF
"YER LATE, ELF!" CAME THE ROUGH
EDGE OF A FAMILIAR
voice. Bruenor Battlehammer
walked up the back of his
deadfoe,
disregardingthefact
that the heavy monster
lay
on top ofhis elvenfriend.
In spite ofthe
added discamfort,
the dwarf's long, pointed,
often-broken
nose and gray-
streaked
though still-fiery red beard came as a welcame
sight to Drizzt. "Knew I'dfindye
in trouble if I came out
an' lookedforyel"
-R. A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard
Kingdoms rich in ancienI grandeur, halls carved into the
rools of mountains, lhe echoing of picks and hammers
in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitmenl
10
clan and lradilion, and a burning halred of goblins and
ores-lhese
eommon lhreads unile ali dwarves.
PART I I RACES
SHORT AND STOUT
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as
skilled warriors, miners, and workers
of stone and melaI. Though lhey sland
well under 5 feel tall, dwarves are so
broad and compael lhal lhey can weigh
as much as a human slanding nearly lwo
feet laller. Their courage and endurance
are also easily a maleh for any of
lhe larger folk.
Owarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler
hue linged wilh red, bul lhe most eommon shades are
lighl brown or deep lan, like cerlain lones of earlh.
Their hair, worn long bul in simple slyles, is usually
black, gray, or brown, lhough paler dwarves oflen have
red hair. Male dwarves value lheir beards highly and
groom lhem carefully.
LONG MEMORY, LONG GRUDGES
Owarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so lhe
oldesl living dwarves often remember a very differenl
world. For example, some of lhe oldesl dwarves living
in Ciladel Felbarr (in lhe world of lhe Forgotten Realms)
can recall lhe day, more lhan three cenluries ago, when
ores conquered lhe forlress and drove lhem into an exile
lhal lasled over 250 years. This longevity granls lhem a
perspeclive on lhe world lhal shorter-lived races such as
humans and halflings lack.
Owarves are solid and enduring like the mounlains
they love, wealhering lhe passage of cenluries wilh stoic
endurance and little change. They respecl lhe lradilions
of lheir clans, lracing their anceslry back lo lhe
founding of lheir mosl ancienl slrongholds in lhe youth
of lhe world, and don'l abandon those lradilions lighlly.
ParI of lhose traditions is devolion lo lhe gods of lhe
dwarves, who uphold lhe dwarven ideais of induslrious
labor, skill in baltle, and devolion lo lhe forge.
Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, lrue lo
lheir word and decisive in action, somelimes lo lhe poinl
of ~tubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense

ofjustice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have
suffered. A wrong dane to one dwarf is a wrong dane to
the dwarf's entire dan, so what begins as one dwarf's
hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown dan feudo
CLANS AND KINGDOMS
Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains
where the dwarves mine gems and precious metais
and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and
artistry of precious metais and fine jewelry, and in some
dwarves this lave festers into avarice. Whatever wealth
they can't find in their mountains,
they gain through
trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising
humans and
halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods
along water routes. Trustworthy
members of other races
are welcome in dwarf settlements,
though some areas
are off limits even to them.
The chief unit of dwarven society is the dan, and
dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves
who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their dan
identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves,
and invoke their ancestors'
names in oaths and curses.
To be danless
is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans,
especially weaponsmiths,
armorers,
and jewelers. Some
become mercenaries
ar bodyguards,
highly sought after
for their courage and loyalty.
GODS,
GOLD,
AND CLAN
Dwarves who take up the adventuring
life might be
motivated bya desire for treasure-for
its own sake, for
a specilic purpose, ar even out of an altruistic desire to
help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command
ar inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a
desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and
ancestry are also important
motivators. A dwarf might
seek to restore a dan's lost honor, avenge an ancienl
wrong the dan suffered, ar earn a new place within the
dan after having been exiled. ar a dwarf might search
for the axe wielded bya mighty ancestor, lost on the lield
of battle centuries
ago.
SLOW
TO TRUST
Dwarves gel along passably well wilh mosl olher races. "The
difference belween an acquainlance
and a friend is aboul a
hundred years," is a dwarf saying lhal mighl be hyperbole,
bul cerlainly poinls lo how diflicull il can be for a member of
a shorl-lived race Iike humans lo eam a dwarf's lrusl.
Elves. "I!'s nol wise lo depend on lhe elves. No lelling whal
an elf will do nexl; when lhe hammer meels lhe orc's head,
lhey're as apllo
slart singing as lo pull oul a sword. They're
fiighly and frivolous. Two lhings lo be said for lhem, lhough:
They don'l have many smilhs, bullhe
ones lhey have do very
fine work. And when ores ar goblins come slreaming down
oul oflhe mounlains,
an elf's good lo have aI your back. Nol
as good as a dwarf, maybe, bul no doubllhey
hale lhe ores
as much as we do."
Half/ings.
"Sure, lhey're pleasanl folk. Sul show me a
halfiing hera. An empire, a lriumphanl
army. Even a lreasure
for lhe ages made by halfiing hands. NOlhing. How can you
lake lhem seriously?"
Humans.
"You lake lhe lime lo gel lo know a human, and
by lhen lhe human's on her dealhbed.
If you're lucky, she's
gol kin-a
daughler ar granddaughler,
maybe-who's
gol
hands and hearl as good as hers. Tha!'s when you can make
a human friend. And walch lhem gol They sellheir
hearts on
somelhing, lhey'll gel il, whelher i!'s a dragon's hoard ar an
empire's lhrone. You have lo admire lhal kind of dedicalion,
even if il gels lhem in lrouble more oflen lhan nol."
