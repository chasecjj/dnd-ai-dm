creature
can't be a construct
or an undead, and you
must have seen the sort of creature
at least once. Vou
transform
into an average example of that creature, one
without any c1ass leveis or the Spellcasting
trait.
Vour game statistics are replaced by the statistics
of the chosen creature, though you retain your
alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
scores. Vou also retain ali of your skill and saving
throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the
creature.
If the creature
has the same proficiency as you
and the bonus Iisted in its statistics is higher than yours,
use the creature's
bonus in place of yours. Vou can't use
any legendary actions or lair actions of the new formo
Vou assume the hit points and Hit Dice ofthe new
formo When you revert to your normal form, you
return to the number of hit points you had before you
transformed.
]f you revert as a result of dropping to
Ohit points, any excess damage carries over to your
normal formo As long as the excess damage doesn't
reduce your normal form to Ohit points, you aren't
knocked unconscious.
Vou retain the benefit of any features from your c1ass,
race, or other source and can use them, provided that
your new form is physically capable of doing so. Vou
can't use any special senses you have (for example,
darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense.
Vou can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
When you transform, you choose whether your
equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new
form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as
normal. The DM determines
whether it is practical for
the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on
the creature's
shape and size. Vour equipment doesn't
change shape or size to match the new form, and any
equipment that the new form can't wear must either fali
to the ground or merge into your new formo Equipment
that merges has no effect in that state.
During this spell's duration, you can use your action to
assume a different form following the same restrictions
and rules for the original form, with one exception; if
your new form has more hit points than your current
one, your hit points remain at their current value.
