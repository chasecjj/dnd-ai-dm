SELLING TREASURE
ARMOR
AND SHIELDS
Opportunities
abound to find treasure,
equipment,
weapons, armar, and more in the dungeons you explore.
Normally, you can sell your treasures
and trinkets when
you return to a town ar other setllement, provided that you
can find buyers and merchants
interested
in your 1001.
Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general
rule, undamaged
weapons, armar, and other equipment
fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons
and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough
condition to sell.
Magic Items. Selling magic items is prablematic.
Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn't toa
hard, but other ilems are out of the realm of most but the
wealthiest
nobles. Likewise, aside fram a few common
magic items, you won't normally come across magic
items ar spells to purchase. The value of magic is far
beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.
Gems,jewe1ry, and Art Objects. These items retain
their full value in the marketplace,
and you can either
trade them in for coin ar use them as currency for other
lransactions.
For exceptionally valuable treasures,
the
DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town ar
larger community first.
Trade Goods. On the borderlands,
many people
conduct transactions
through barter. Like gems and art
objects, trade goods-bars
of iran, bags of salt, Iivestock,
and so on-relain
lheir full value in the market and can
be used as currency.
D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many
different cultures, each with its own technology leveI.
For this reason, adventurers
have access to a variety
of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain
mail to costly plate armar, with several other kinds of
armor in between. The Armor table collects the most
commonly available types of armar found in the game
and separates
them into three calegories: light armor,
medium armar, and heavy armar. Many warriors
supplement
their armar with a shield.

The Armar table shows the cost, weight, and other
properties
of the common lypes of armor worn in the
worlds of D&D.
Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armar
ar strap a shield to an armo Only those praficient in the
armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however.
Your class gives you praficiency with certain types of
armor.lfyou
wear armor that you lack proficiency with,
you have disadvantage
on any ability check, saving
thraw, ar atlack roll that involves Strength
or Dexterity,
and you can't cast spells.
Armor Class (AC).Armar protects its wearer fram
atlacks. The armar (and shield) you wear determines
your base Armar Class.
Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the
wearer's
ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.
lf the Armor table shows "Str 13" ar "Str 15" in the
Strength
column for an armar type, the armar reduces
the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a
Strength
score equal to or higher than the listed score.
Stealth. lf the Armar table shows "Disadvanlage"
in
the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage
on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Shields. A shield is made fram wood ar metal and
is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases
your Armar Class by 2. Vou can benefit from only one
shield at a time.
LIGHTARMOR
Made fram supple and thin materiais, light armor favors
agile adventurers
since it offers some pratection
without
sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armar, you add
your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your
armar type to determine your Armar Class.
Padded. Padded armar consists of quilted layers of
cloth and batting.
Leather. The breastplate
and shoulder protectors
of
this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened
by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armar is made of
softer and more flexible materiaIs.
Studded Leather. Made from tough but flexible
leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set
rivets ar spikes .
VARIANT:
EQUIPMENT
SIZES
In most campaigns,
you can use ar wear any equipment
that
you find on your adventures,
within the bounds
of common
sense.
For example,
a burly haif.orc won't fit in a halfling's
leather armar, and a gnome
would be swallowed
up in a
c10ud giant's elegant
robe.
The DM can impose
more realism.
For example,
a suit of
plate armar
made for one human
might not fit another
one
without
significant
alterations,
and a guard's
uniform
mighl
be visibly ill.fitting when an adventurer
tries to wear it as a
disguise.
Using this variant,
when adventurers
find armar, c1othing.
and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need
to visit an armorsmith,
tailor, leatherworker,
ar similar exper!
to make the item wearable.
The cost for such work varies
from 10 to 40 percent
ofthe
market
price ofthe
item. The
DM can either rollld4
x 10 ar determine
the increase
in cost
based on the extent of the alterations
required.

PART 1 I EQUIPMENT
MEDIUM
ARMOR
Medium armar offers more pratection than light armar,
but il also impairs movement more.lfyou

armor, you add your Dexlerity modifier, to a maximum
of +2, to the base number fram your armor type to
determine
your Armar Class.
Hide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and
pelts. lt is commonly worn by barbarian
tribes, evil
humanoids,
and other folk who lack access to the tools
and materiaIs needed lOcreate betler armor.
Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking
metal rings, a chain
shirl is worn belween layers of clothing ar leather. This
armor offers modest protection to the wearer's
upper
body and allows lhe sound of the rings rubbing against
one another to be muffled by outer layers.
ScaleMail.This
armar consists of a coat and leggings
(and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with
