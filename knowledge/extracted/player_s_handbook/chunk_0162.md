Divine energy radiates from you, distorting and
diffusing magical energy within 30 feet of you. Until
the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on
you. For the duration, each friendly creature in the area
(including you) has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects. Additionally, when
an affected creature succeeds on a saving throw made
against a spell ar magical effect that allows it to make a
saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes
no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw.

and is large enough to hold a Medium creature, such
as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, ar
crystal container filled with salt water)
Duration: !nstantaneous
This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature
as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside
a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity
after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone
be a younger version of the same creature. lt remains
inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel
remains undisturbed.
At any time after the clone matures, if the original
creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided
that the soul is free and willing to returno The clone is
physically identical to the original and has the same
personality, memories, and abilities, but nane of the
original's equipment. The original creature's physical
remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't
thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's souI
is elsewhere.
