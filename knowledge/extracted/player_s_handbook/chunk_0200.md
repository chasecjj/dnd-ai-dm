Vou and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in
a circle are transported to a different plane of existence.
Vou can specify a target destination in general terms,
such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of
Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second levei of the
Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination.
Iryou are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example,
you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of
Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire,
at the DM's discretion.
Alternatively, ifyou know the sigil sequence of a
teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this
spell can take you to that circle. Ir the teleportation
circle is too small to hold ali the creatures you
transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied
spaces next to the circle.
Voucan use this spell to banish an unwilling creature
to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach
and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the
creature must make a Charisma saving throw. Ir the
creature fails this save, it is transported to a random
location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature
so transported must find its own way back to your
current plane of existence.

returns to the number of hit points it had before it
transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to
O hit points, any excess damage carries over to its
normal formoAs long as the excess damage doesn't
reduce the creature's normal form to O hit points, it isn't
knocked unconscious.

the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells,
ar take any other action that requires hands ar speech.
