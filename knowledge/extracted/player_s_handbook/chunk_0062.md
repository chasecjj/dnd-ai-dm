TENETS
OF VENGEANCE
The tenets of the Oath of Vengeanee vary by paladin, but
ali the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers
by
any means neeessary.
Paladins who uphold these tenets
are willing to saerifiee even their own righteousness
to
mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins
are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignmen!. The
core principIes of the tenets are brutally simple.
Fight the Greater Evil. Faeed with a ehoice of fighting
my sworn foes or eombating a Iesser evil, I ehoose the
greater evil.
No Merey for the Wieked. Ordinary foes might win
my merey, but my sworn enemies do no!.
By Any Means Neeessary. My qualms ean't get in the
way of exterminating
my foes.
Restitution.
]f my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is
beca use I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed
by their misdeeds.

frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage
