TIKA
ANO
ARTEMIS:
PERSONAL
CHARACTERISTICS
Tika and Artemis
have distinct
personality
traits. Tika Waylan
dislikes
boastfulness
and has a fear of heights
resulting
from a bad fali during
her career
as a thief. Artemis
Entreri
is always prepared
for the worst and moves
with a quick,
precise
confidence.
Consider
their ideais. Tika Waylan is innocent,
almost
childlike,
believing
in the value oflife and the importance
of
appreciating
everyone.
Neutral
good in alignment,
she c1eaves
to ideais of life and respec!.
Artemis
Entreri never allows
his emotions
to master
him, and he constantly
challenges
himself to improve
his skills. His lawful evil alignment
gives
him ideais of impartiality
and a lust for power.
Tika Waylan's
bond is to the Inn ofthe
Last Home.
The
inn's proprietor
gave her a new chance
at life, and her
friendship
with her adventuring
companions
was forged
during
her time working
there.
Its destruction
by the
marauding
dragonarmies
gives Tika a very personal
reason
to
hate them with a fiery passion.
Her bond might
be phrased
as "I will do whatever
it takes to punish
the dragonarmies
for
the destruction
ofthe
Inn ofthe
Last Home."
Artemis
Entreri's
bond is a strange,
almost
paradoxical
relationship
with Drizzt Do'Urden,
his equal in swordplay
and grim determination.
In his first battle with Drizzt,
Artemis
recognized
something
of himself
in his opponent,
some
indication
that if his life had gone differently,
he
might
have led a life more like the heroic drow's.
From that
moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin-he
is an
antihero,
driven
by his rivalry with Drizz!. His bond might be
phrased
as "I will not rest untill
have proved
myselfbetter
than
Drizzt Do'Urden."
Each of these
characters
also has an important
flaw.
Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally
vulnerable,
younger
than her companions
and annoyed
that they still think
of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be
tempted
to act against
her principies
if she's
convinced
that
a particular
achievement
would demonstrate
her maturity.
Artemis
Entreri is completely
walled offfrom
any personal
relationship
and just wants to be left alone.

A useful place to start thinking about personality
traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores
and define one trait related to each. Either one could be
positive or nega tive: you might work hard to overcome a
low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.

SCRIPT:
SAMPLE
ALPHABET
IDEALS
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideais
are the things that you believe in most strongly, the
fundamental
moral and ethical principies that compel you
to act as you do. Ideais encompass
everything from your
life goals to your core belief system.
Ideais might answer any of these questions: What are
the principies that you will neve r betray? What would
prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act
and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single
most important
thing you strive for?
Vou can choose any ideais you like, but your
character's
alignment is a good place to start defining
them. Each background
in this chapter includes six
suggested
ideais. Five of them are linked to aspects of
alignment: law, chaos, good, evit, and neutrality. The last
one has more to do with the particular
background
than
with moral or ethical perspectives.
BONDS
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent
a
character's
connections
to people, places, and events in
the world. They tie you to things from your background.
They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead
you to act against your own best interests
if they are
threatened.
They can work very much like ideaIs,
driving a character's
motivations and goals.
Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do
you care most about? To what place do you feeI a special
connection? What is your most treasured
possession?
Your bonds might be tied to your c1ass, your
background, your race, or some other aspect of your
character's
history or personality. Vou might also gain
new bonds over the course of your adventures.
FLAWS
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your
character's
flaw represents
some vice, compulsion, fear,
or weakness-in
particular,
anything that someone
e1se could exploit to bring you to ruin ar cause you to
act against your best interests.
More significant than
nega tive personality
traits, a flaw might answer any
of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one
person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What
are your vices?
