RANGER ARCHETYPES
The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions:
the
Hunter and the Beast Master.
HUNTER
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your
place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors
of the wilderness.
As you walk the Hunter's path, you
learn specialized
techniques
for fighting the threats
you face, from rampaging
ogres and hordes of ores to
towering giants and terrifying dragons.
HUNTER'S
PREY
At 3rd levei, you gain one of the following features
of your choice.
C%ssus
S/ayer. Your tenacity can wear down
the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, the creature
takes an extra ld8 damage
if it's below its hit point maximum. Vou can deal this
extra damage only once per turno
Giant Ki//er. When a Large or larger creature
within
5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can
use your reaction to attack that creature
immediately
after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
Horde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you
make a weapon attack, you can make another attack
with the same weapon against a different creature
that
is within 5 feet of the original target and within range
of your weapon.
DEFENSIVE
TACTICS
At 7th leveI, you gain one of the foIlowing features
of your choice.
Escape the Horde. Opportunity
attacks against you
are made with disadvantage.
Mu/tiattack Defense. When a creature
hits you
with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against
ali subsequent
attacks made by that creature
for the
rest of the turno
Stee/ Wi//. Vou have advantage on saving throws
against being frightened.
MULTIATTACK
At 11th levei, you gain one of the following features
of your choice.
Vo//ey. Vou can use your action to make a ranged
attack against any number of creatures
within 10 feet
of a point you can see within your weapon's range. Vou
must have ammunition
for each target, as normal, and
you make a separate attack roll for each target.
Whir/wind Attack. Vou can use your action to make a
melee attack against any number of creatures
within 5
feet of you, with a separate attack roIl for each target.
SUPERIOR
HUNTER'S
DEFENSE
At 15th levei, you gain one of the following features
of your choice.
Evasion. Vou can nimbly dodge out of the way of
certa in area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath
or a lightning bolt spel!. When you are subjected to an
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw
to take only half damage, you instead take no damage
if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half
damage if you fai!'

misses you with a mele e attack, you can use your reaction
to force that creature
to repeat the same attack against
another creature
(other than itself) of your choice.
Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to
halve the attack's damage against you.
BEAST MASTER
The Beast Master archetype
embodies a friendship
between the civilized races and the beasts of the world.
United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight
the monstrous
foes that threaten civilization and the
wilderness
alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype
means committing yourself to this ideal, working in
partnership
with all animal as its companion and friend.
RANGER'S
COMPANION
At 3rd levei, you gain a beast companion that
accompanies
you on your adventures
and is trained to
fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than
Medium and that has a chaIlenge rating of 1/4 or lower
(appendix O presellts statistics
for the hawk, mastiff,
and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus
to the beast's AC, attack roIls, and damage rolls, as weIl
as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its
hit poinl maximum equals its normal maximum or four
times your ranger leveI, whichever is higher.
The beast obeys your commands
as best as it cano It
takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn't take an
action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can
verbally command
the beast where to move (no action
required by you). Vou can use your action to verbally
command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge,
or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature,
you can make one weapon attack yourself when you
command the beast to take the Attack action.
While traveling through your favored terrain with only
the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
lf the beast dies, you can obtain another one by
spending 8 hours magicaIly bonding with another beast
that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as
before or a different one.
EXCEPTIONAL
TRAINING
Beginning at 7th levei, on any of your turns when
your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a
bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash,
Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turno
BESTIAL
FURY
Starting at 11th leveI, your beast companion can
make two attacks when you command it to use the
Attack action.
SHARE
SPELLS

yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with
the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of YOU.
