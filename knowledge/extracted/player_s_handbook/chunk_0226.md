ApPENDIX c: THE
PLANES
OF EXISTENCE
••

r
NCREDlBLYVAST
lS THE
COSMOS
OF THE
DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame, which teems
with a multitude of worlds as weJl as myriad
alternate dimensions
of reality, calIed the planes
of existence.
lt encompasses
every world
where Dungeon Masters run their adventures,
alI within the relatively mundane realm of the
Material Plane. Beyond lhat plane are domains
of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure
thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels,
and the dominions of the gods.
Many spelIs and magic items can draw energy
from these planes, summon the creatures
that dwelI
there, communicate
with their denizens, and alIow
advenlurers
to travei there. As your character
achieves
greater power and higher leveIs, you might undertake
a quest to rescue a friend fram the horrific depths of
the Abyss, or find yourself hoisting a tankard with lhe
friendly giants of Ysgard. Vou might walk on streets
made of solid fire or lest your mettle on a battlefield
where lhe falIen are resurrected
with each dawn.
THE MATERIAL
PLANE
The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical
and elemental forces tha! define the other planes colIide
in lhe jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane
matter. AlI the worlds of 0&0 exist within the Material
Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns
and adventures.
The rest of the multiverse is defined in
relation to the Material Plane.
The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse,
for lhey reflect the creative imagination
of the DMs
who set their games there, as weJl as the players whose
heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasled
desert planets and island-dotted
waler worlds, worlds
where magic combines with advanced technology and
others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where
the gods walk and places they have abandoned.

APPENDIX
C I THE
PLANES
OF
EXISTENCE
The best-known worlds in lhe multiverse are lhe
ones lha! have been published as official campaign
settings for the 0&0 game over the years-Greyhawk,
Blackmoor, Dragonlance,
the Forgotten Realms,
Mystara, Birthright,
Dark Sun, and Eberron, among
others. Each of these worlds boasts its own cast of
heroic adventurers
and scheming villains, its own
ancient ruins and forgotten artifacts, its own dungeons
and its own dragons. But if your campaign takes place
on one of these worlds, it belongs to your DM-you
mighl imagine it as one of thousands
of paralIel versions
of the world, which might diverge wildly from the
published version.
MATERIAL
ECHOES
The Material Plane is a richly magical place, and its
magical nalure is reflected in the two planes that share
its central place in the multiverse. The Feywild and the
ShadowfelI are paralIel dimensions
occupying the same
cosmological
space, so they are often calIed echo planes
or mirrar planes to the Material Plane. The worlds and
landscapes
of these planes mirror lhe natural world
of the Material Plane but reflect those fealures into
different forms-more
marvelous and magical in the
Feywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell.
Where a volcano stands in the Malerial Plane, a
mountain topped with skyscraper-sized
crystals that
glow with internai fire towers in lhe Feywild, and a
jagged rock outcrapping
resembling
a skuJl marks the
spot on the Shadowfell.
The Feywild, also calIed the Plane of Faerie, is a land
of soft lights and wonder, a country of little people with
great desires, a place of music and death. lt is a realm
of eternal twilight, with slow lanterns bobbing in the
gentle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through graves
and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of
lhe setting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun
neve r truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky
and low in the sky. Away fram the settled areas ruled by
the Seelie Court, lhe land is a tangle of sharp-toothed
brambles and syrupy fens-perfect
territory for the
Unseelie to hunt their prey. Fey creatures,
such as those
brought to the world by conjure woad/and beings and
similar spelIs, dwelI in the Feywild.
The Shadowfell,
also calIed the Plane af Shadaw, is
a darkly lighted dimension, a world af black and white
where colar has been leached fram everything. lt is a
place af taxic darkness
that hates the light, where the
sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.

PLANES
Like a dome above the other planes, the Positive
Plane is the
source of radianl energy and lhe raw life force lhal suffuses
allliving beings, from lhe puny lo lhe sublime, Ils dark
refleclion is lhe Negative Plane, lhe source of necrolic energy
