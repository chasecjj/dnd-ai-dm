Vou transmute
your quiver so it produces an endless
supply of nonmagical
ammunition,
which seems to leap
into your hand when you reach for it.
On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use
a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that
uses ammunition
from the quiver. Each time you make
such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces
the piece of ammunition
you used with a similar piece
of nonmagical
ammunition.
Any pieces of ammunition
created by this spell disintegrate
when the spell ends. ]f
the quiver leaves your possession,
the spell ends.
SYMBOL
7th-levei abjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components:
V,S, M (mercury, phosphorus,
and
powdered diamond and opa I with a total value of at
least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration:
Until dispelled or triggered
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph
either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or
a table) or within an object that can be c10sed to conceal
the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure
chest).
]f you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of
the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you
choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if
the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you
cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends
without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence
(lnvestigation)
check against your spell save
DC to find it.
Vou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the
spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical
triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph,
removing another object covering it, approaching
within
a certain distance of it, or manipulating
the object
that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object,
the most common triggers are opening the object,
approaching
within a certain distance of it, or seeing or
reading the glyph.
Vou can further refine the trigger so the spell is
activated only under certain circumstances
or according
to a creature's
physical characteristics
(such as height
or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could
be set to affect hags or shapechangers).
Vou can also
specify creatures
that don't trigger the glyph, such as
those who say a certain password.
When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the
options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph
glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim Iight
for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each
creature
in the sphere when the glyph activates is
targcted by its effect, as is a creature
that enters the
sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
Death. Each target must make a Constitution
saving
throw, taking IOdlO necrotic damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful
save.
Discord.
Each target must make a Constitution
saving
throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues
with other creatures
for 1 minute. During this time,
PART

it is incapable of meaningful
communication
and has
disadvantage
on attack rolls and ability checks.
Fear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw
and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save.
While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding
and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on
each of its turns, if able.
Hope/essness.
Each target must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failed save, the target is
overwhelmed
with despair for 1 minute. During this
time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful
abilities, spells, or other magical effects.
Insanity. Each target must make an lntelligence saving
throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for
1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't
understand
what other creatures
say, can't read, and
speaks only in gibberish. The DM contrais its movement,
which is erratic.
Pain. Each target must make a Constitution
saving
throw and becomes incapacitated
with excruciating
pain
for 1 minute on a failed save.
S/eep. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw
and falls unconscious
for 10 minutes on a failed save. A
creature
awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses
an action to shake or slap it awake.
Stunning. Each target must make a Wisdom saving
throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.
