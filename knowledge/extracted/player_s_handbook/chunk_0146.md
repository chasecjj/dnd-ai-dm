start making death saving throws again, if it takes any

MONSTERS
AND DEATH
Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to
Ohit points, rather than having it fali unconscious
and
make death saving throws.
Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters
are common exceptions; the DM might have them
fali unconscious
and follow the same rules as
player characters.
KNOCKING
A CREATURE
OUT
Sometimes
an attacker wants to incapacitate
a foe,
rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker
reduces a creature
to Ohit points with a melee attack,
the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker
can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt.
The creature
falls unconscious
and is stable.
TEMPORARY
HIT
POINTS
Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit
points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual
hit points: they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit
points that protect you from injury.
When you have temporary hit points and take damage,
the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover
damage carries over to your normal hit points. For
example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take
7 damage, you lose the temporary
hit points and then
take 2 damage.
Because temporary hit points are separate
from
your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point
maximum. A character
can, therefore, be at full hit
points and receive temporary hit points.
Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they
can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points
and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep
the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example,
if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you
already have lO, you can have 12 or lO, not 22.
lf you have Ohit points, receiving temporary
hit points
doesn't restore you to consciousness
or stabilize you.
They can still absorb damage directed at you while
you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.
Unless a feature that grants you temporary
hit points
has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you
finish a long resto
MOUNTED
COMBAT
A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard
casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a c1eric
soaring through the sky on a pegasus ali enjoy the
benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.
A willing creature
that is at least one size larger than
you and that has an appropriate
anatomy can serve as a
mount, using the following rules.
PART 2 I COMBAT
MOUNTING
AND DISMOUNTING
Once during your move, you can mount a creature
that
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an
amount of movement equal to half your speed. For
example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15
feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can't
mount it if you don't have 15 feet of movement left or
if your speed is O.
If an effect moves your mount against its will while
you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity
saving throw or fali off the mount, landing prone in a
space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while
mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
1fyour mount is knocked prone, you can use your
reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet.
Otherwise,
you are dismounted
and fali prone in a
space within 5 feet it.
CONTROLLING
A MOUNT
While you're mounted, you have two options. Vou
can either control the mount or allow it to act
independently.
Intelligent creatures,
such as dragons,
act independently.
Vou can controI a mount only if it has been trained
to accept a rider. Domesticated
horses, donkeys, and
similar creatures
are assumed
to have such training.
The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match
yours when you mount it. 1t moves as you direct it, and
it has only three action options; Dash, Disengage, and
Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on
the tu rn that you mount it.
An independent
mount retains its place in the
initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions
on
the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts
as it wishes. 1tmight flee from combat, rush to attack
and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise
act against
your wishes.
In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity
attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you
or the mount.
UNDERWATER COMBAT
When adventurers
pursue sahuagin
back to their
undersea
homes, fight off sharks in an ancient
shipwreck,
or find themselves
in a flooded dungeon
room, they must fight in a challenging environment.
Underwater
the following rules apply.
When making a me1ee weapon
attack, a creature
that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or
granted by magic) has disadvantage
on the attack roll
unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword,
spear, or trident.
A ranged weapon attack
automatically misses
a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even
against a target within normal range, the attack roll has
disadvantage
unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or
a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear,
trident, or dart).
Creatures
and objects that are fully immersed
in
water have resistance
to fire damage.
