NSPIRATION FORALLOFTHE
FANTASYWORK IHAVE
dane stems
directly
from
the lave my father
showed
when
I was a lad, for he spent
many
hours
telling me stories
he made
up as he went
along,
tales of cloaked
old men
who could grant
wishes,
of magic
rings and enchanted
swords,
ar wicked
sorcerers
and dauntless
swordsmen
..
. . A11 of us tend to get ample
helpings
of fantasy
when
we are very young,
fram
fairy tales such as those
written
by the Brathers
Grimm
and Andrew
Lang.
This often
leads
to reading
books
of mythology.
paging
thraugh
bestiaries,
and consultation
of compilations
of the myths
of various
lands
and peoples.
Upon such
a base
J built my interest
in fantasy.
being
an avid
reader
of a11science
fiction and fantasy
literature
since
1950.
The fo11owing authors
were ofparticular
inspiration
to me.
