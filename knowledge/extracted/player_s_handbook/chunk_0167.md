a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn
while the fiood effect lasts.
Part Water. Vou cause water in the area to move
aparl and creale a lrench. The trench extends across
the spell's area, and the separaled
waler forms a wall lo
either side. The lrench remains unlil lhe spell ends or
you choose a different effect. The waler lhen slowly fills
in lhe trench over lhe course of the next round until the
normal water levei is restored.
Redirect
FIow. Vou cause fiowing water in the area
to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has
to fiow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely
directions.
The water in the area moves as you direct
it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes
its fiow based on the terrain conditions. The water
continues to move in the direction you chose until the
spell ends or you choose a different effect.
WhirIpooI. This effect requires a body of water
at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. Vou cause
a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The
whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the
base, up to 50 feet wide ai the top, and 25 feel tall. Any
creature
or object in the water and within 25 feet of the
vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature
can swim
away from the vortex by making a Strength
(Athletics)
check against your spell save DC.
When a creature
enters the vortex for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
takes 2d8
bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until
the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature
takes
half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A crealure
caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim
away from the vortex as described
above, but has
disadvanlage
on lhe Strength
(Athletics) check to do so.
The first time each turn that an object enters the
vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this
damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.
