HAUGHTY
BUT GRACIOUS
Although
they can be haughty,
elves are generally
gracious
even to those who fali short of their high expectations-
which is most non.elves.
5till, they can find good in just
about anyone.
Dwarves. "Dwarves
are dull, c1umsy oafs. But what they
lack in humor,
sophistication,
and manners,
they make up in
valor. And I must admit, their best smiths
produce
art that
approaches
elven quality."
Haljlings.
"Halflings
are people of simple
pleasures,
and
that is not a quality to scorn. lhey're
good folk, they care
for each other and tend their gardens,
and they have proven
themselves
tougher
than they seem when the need arises."
Humans.
"Ali that haste, their ambition
and drive to
accomplish
something
before their brieflives
pass away-
human
endeavors
seem
50 futile sometimes.
But then
you look at what they have accomplished,
and you have to
appreciate
their achievements.
If only they could slow down
and learn some
refinement."
