By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones,
laying out ornate cards, or employing some other
divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly
entity about the results of a specific course of action that
you plan to take within the next 30 minutes, The DM
chooses from the following possible omens:
Weal, for good results
Woe, for bad results
Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad
The spell doesn't take into account any possible
circumstances
that might change the outcome, such
as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain
of a companion.
If you cast the spell two or more times before
completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25
percent chance for each casting after the first that you
get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.
