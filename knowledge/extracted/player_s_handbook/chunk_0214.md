TELEPORTATION
CIRCLE
5th-leveI conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 10 feet
Components:
V,M (rare chalks and inks infused with
precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration:
1 round
As you cast the spell, you draw a lO-foot-diameter
circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that Iink
your location to a permanent teleportation circle of
your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is
on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering
portal opens within the circle you drew and remains
open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that
enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the
destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if
that space is occupied.
Many major tempIes, guilds, and other important
places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed
somewhere within their confines. Each such circle
includes a unique sigil sequence-a
string of magical
runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first
gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil
sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane,
determined by the DM.Vou can learn additional sigil
sequences during your adventures. Voucan commit
a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it
for 1 minute.
Vou can create a permanent teleportation circle by
casting this spell in the same location every day for one
year. Vou need not use the circle to teleport when you
cast the spell in this way.
TENSER'S
FLOATING
DISK
1st-leveI conjuration (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components:
V,S, M (a drop of mercury)
Duration:
1 hour
This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force,
3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that lIoats 3 feet
above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice
that you can see within range. The disk remains for the
duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight
is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk
falls to the ground.
The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of
it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk
follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of YOU. It
can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs,
slopes and the Iike. but it can't cross an e1evationchange
of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move
across a IO-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it
was created at the bottom.
Ifyou move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically
because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you),
the spell ends.
