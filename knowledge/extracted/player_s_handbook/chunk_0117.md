MOUNTS
AND VEHICLES
A good mount can help you move more quickly through
the wilderness,
but its primary purpose is to carry the
gear that would otherwise
slow you down. The Mounts
and Other Animais table shows each animal's speed and
base carrying capacity.
An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled,
or wagon can move weight up to tive times its base
carrying capacity, inc1uding the weight of the vehic1e.
If multiple animais pull the same vehic1e, they can add
their carrying capacity together.
Mounts other than those listed here are available in
the worlds of 0&0, but they are rare and not normally
available for purchase. These inc1ude flying mounts
(pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animaIs) and
even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example).
Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg
and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with
a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.
Barding. Barding is armor designed to protect an
animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of
armor shown on the Armor table in this chapter can
be purchased
as barding. The cost is four times the
equivalent armor made for humanoids,
and it weighs
twice as much.
SaddJes. A military saddle braces the rider, helping
you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. 1t
gives you advantage on any check you make to remain
mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any
aquatic or flying mount.
VehicJeProficiency. Ifyou have proticiency with a
certain kind of vehic1e (land or water), you can add your
proticiency bonus to any check you make to control that
kind of vehic1e in difficult circumstances.
Rowed Vesse1s. Keelboats and rowboats are used
OH
lakes and rivers. If going downstream,
add the speed of
the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of
55

EXPENSES
EXPENSES
When not descending
into lhe depths of the earth,
exploring ruins for lost treasures,
or waging war againsl
the encroaching
darkness,
adventurers
face more
mundane
realities. Even in a fanlastical world, people
require basic necessilies
such as shelter, sustenance,
and clothing. These things cost money, allhough some
lifestyles cosI more lhan others.
Lifeslyle expenses
provide you with a simple way lo
accounl for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They
cover your accommodations,
food and drink, and ali
your olher necessities.
Furthermore,
expenses cover the
cosi of maintaining
your equipment so you can be ready
when advenlure nexl calls.
At lhe slart of each week or month (your choice),
choose a lifeslyle from the Expenses
lable and pay the
price to sustain lhat lifeslyle. The prices lisled are per
day, so if you wish lo calculate the cosI of your chosen
lifestyle over a thirly-day period, multiply the listed price
by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period lo
lhe next, based on lhe funds you have aI your disposal,
or you might maintain lhe same lifestyle throughout
your character's
career.
Your Iifestyle choice can have consequences.
Mainlaining
a weallhy lifestyle might help you make
contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the
risk of altracting
thieves. Likewise, living frugally might
help you avoid criminais,
but you are unlikely lo make
powerful conneclions.
