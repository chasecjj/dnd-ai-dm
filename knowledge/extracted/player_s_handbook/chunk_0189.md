(allowing the target to see out and other creatures
to see
in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of
teleportation
or planar traveI. The gemstone can't be cut
or braken while the spell remains in effcct.
The special component for this version of the spell

gemstone, such as a corundum,
diamond, or ruby.
Slumber. The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.
The speciai component for this version of the spell
consists of rare soporific herbs.
Ending the Spe/l. During the casting of the spell,
in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that
will cause the spell to end and release the target. The
condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you
choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is
reasonable
and has a likelihood of coming to passo The
conditions can be based on a creature's
name, identity,
or deity but otherwise
must be based on observable
actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as
levei, class, or hit points.
A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast
as a 9th.level spell, targeting either the prison or the
special component used to create it.
Vou can use a particular
special component to create
only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again
using the same component, the target of the first casting
is immediately freed fram its binding.

Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell
brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant
lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist
of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore
that has never been widely known. lf the thing you
named isn't of legendary importance, you gain no
information. The more information you already have
about the thing, the more precise and detailed the
information you receive is.
The information you learn is accurate but might be
couched in figurative language. For example, if you
have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might
yield this information: "Woe to the evildoer whose hand
touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the
evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved
of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and
only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips."
