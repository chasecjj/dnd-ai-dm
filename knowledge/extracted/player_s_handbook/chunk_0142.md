IMPROVISING
AN ACTION
Your character
can do things
not covered
by the actions
in
this chapter,
such as breaking
down doors,
intimidating
enemies,
sensing
weaknesses
in magical defenses,
or calling
for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions
you can
attempt
are your imagination
and your character's
ability
scores.
See the descriptions
of the ability scores
in chapter
7
for inspiration as you improvise.
When you describe
an action not detailed
elsewhere
in
the rules, the DM tells you whether
that action is possible
and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine
success ar failure.

READY
Sometimes
you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for
a particular
circumstance
before you act. To do so, you
can take lhe Ready action on your turn so that you can
act later in the round using your reaction.
First, you decide what perceivable circumstance
will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose lhe action
you will take in response
to that trigger, or you choose
to move up to your speed in response
to it. Examples
include "lf lhe cultist steps on the trapdoor, 1'11pull the
lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me,
I move away."
When the lrigger occurs, you can either take your
reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore
the trigger. Remember that you can take only one
reaction per round.
When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but
hold its energy, which you release with your reaction
when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must'
have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the
spell's magic requires concenlration
(explained in
chapter 10). If your concentration
is broken, the spell
dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are
concentrating
on the web spell and ready magic missiJe,
your web spell ends, and if you take damage before
you release magie missiJe with your reaction, your
concentration
might be broken.
SEARCH
When you take the Search action, you devote your
attention to finding something.
Depending on the
nature of your search, the DM might have you make
a Wisdom (Perception) check or an lntelligence
(Investigation) check.
USE AN OBJECT
Vou normally interact with an object while doing
something
else, such as when you draw a sword as part
of an attack. When an object requires your action for
its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action
is also useful when you want to interact with more than
one object on your turno
MAKING
AN ATTACK
Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a
weapon aI range, or making an attack roll as part of a
spell, an attack has a simple structure.


--- Page 195 ---

1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack's
range: a creature, an object, ar a location.
2. Determine
modifiers. The DM determines whether
the target has cover and whether you have advantage
ar disadvantage against the target. In addition, spel1s,
special abilities. and other effects can apply penalties
ar bonuses to your attack rol1.
3. Resolve the attack. Vou make the attack roll. On a
hit, you rol1damage, unless the particular attack has
rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause
special effects in addition to ar instead of damage.
If there's ever any question whether something you're
doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're
making an attack rol1,you're making an attack.
ATTACK ROLLS
When you make an attack, your attack roll determines
whether the attack hits ar misses. To make an attack
rol1,rol1a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. lf the
total of the roll plus modifiers equals ar exceeds the
target's Armar Class (AC),the attack hits. The AC of a
character is determined at character creation. whereas
the ACof a monster is in its stat block.
MODIFIERS
TO THE ROLL
When a character makes an attack rol1,the two most
common modifiers to the rol1are an ability modifier
and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster
makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is
provided in its stat block.
Ability
Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee
weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used
for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that
have the finesse ar thrown property break this rule.
Some spel1s also require an attack roll. The ability
modifier used for a spel1attack depends on the
spellcasting ability of the spel1caster, as explained
in chapter 10.
Proficiency
Bonus. Vou add your proficiency bonus
to your attack rol1when you attack using a weapon with
which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack
with a spell.
ROLLING I OR 20
Sometimes fate blesses ar curses a combatant, causing
the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.
If the d20 rol1for an attack is a 20, the attack hits
regardless of any modifiers ar the target's AC. In
addition, the attack is a criticai hit, as explained later
in this chapter.
If the d20 roll for an attack is a I, the attack misses
regardless of any modifiers ar the target's AC.
UNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS
Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice
by hiding, casting the invisibility spel1,ar lurking
in darkness.
When you attack a target that you can't see, you have
disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether
you're guessing the target's location ar you're targeting
a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in
