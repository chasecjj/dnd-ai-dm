halflings are loath to share it with others. They write

Cunningham.
Daughterofthe
Drow
In the reckonings of most worlds. humans are the
youngest of the common races. late to arrive on the
world scene and short-lived in comparison
to dwarves.
elves. and dragons. Perhaps
it is because of their shorter
lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in
the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have
something
to prove to the elder races. and that's why
they build their mighty empires on the foundation of
conquest and trade. Whatever drives them. humans
are the innovators. the achievers. and the pioneers
of the worlds.
A BROAD SPECTRUM
With their penchant for migration and conquest.
humans are more physically diverse than other common
races. There is no typical humano An individual can
stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh
fram 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range
fram nearly black to very pale. and hair colors from
black to blond (curly. kinky. or straight); males might
sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans
have a dash of nonhuman
blood. revealing hints of elf.
ore, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their
late teens and rarely live even a single century.
VARIETY
IN ALL THINGS
Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people
among the common races. They have widely varying
tastes, morais, and customs in the many different lands
where they have settled. When they settle, though,
they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and
great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries.
An
individual human might have a relatively short life span,
but a human nation or culture preserves
traditions
with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's
memory. They live fully in the present-making
them
well suited to the adventuring
life-but
also plan for the
future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and
as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists,
and
they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.
