B: GODS OF THE MULTIVERSE
D&D PANTHEONS
THE
FORGOTTEN
REALMS
Dozens of deities are revered, worshiped,
and feared
throughout
the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least
thirly deities are widely known across the Realms, and
many more are worshiped
locally, by individual tribes,
small cults, or certain sects of larger religious tem pies.
Each world in the D&D multiverse has its own
pantheons
of deities, ranging in size from the teeming
pantheons
of the Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk to
the more focused religions of Eberron and Dragonlance.
Many of the nonhuman
races worship the same gods on
different worlds-Moradin,
for example, is revered by
dwarves of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and many
other worlds.
EBERRON
The world of Eberron has many different religions, but
the most important
revolves around a pantheon called
the Sovereign Host and their malign shadow, the Dark
Six. The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have
dominion over every aspect of existence, and to speak
with a unified voice. But the Dark Six are the primitive,
bloody, and cruel gods who offer a dissenting
voice.
Eberron's other religions are very different from the
traditional
D&D pantheons.
The monotheistic
Church
of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in
the world, but plagued by corruption
in its own ranks.
The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity
Iies within ali mortal beings and reveres the undead
who have secured
lhat immortality. Various mad cults
are devoted to the demons and horrors imprisoned
in Eberron's
Underdark (called Khyber, lhe Dragon
Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that
the world is heading toward a glorious future where
the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed
into Iight. And two relaled nations of e1ves revere their
ancestral
spirits: lhe Undying Court, preserved
as
spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits
of the Past, the great heroes of aneient wars.
DRAGONLANCE
The gods of the world of Krynn are three families: seven
gods of good headed by Paladine and Mishakal, seven of
neutrality headed by Gilean, and seven of evil headed by
Takhisis and Sargonnas.
These deities have been called
by many different names and held in varying leveis of
esteem by different peoples and cultures through the
world's history, but they are the only gods of this world-
their place fixed in the stars as constellations.
NONHUMAN
DEITIES
Certain gods closely associated
with nonhuman
races
are revered on many different worlds, though not always
in the same way. The nonhuman
races of the Forgotten
Realms and Greyhawk share these deities.
Nonhuman
races often have whole pantheons
of
their own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf
gods include Moradin's wife, Berronar Truesilver, and
a number of other gods thought to be their children
and grandchildren:
Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard,
Dugmaren
Brightmantle,
Dumathoin,
Gorm Gullhyn,
Haela Brightaxe, Marthammor
Duin, Sharindlar,
Thard
Harr, and Vergadain. Individual dans and kingdoms of
dwarves might revere some, ali, or none of these deities,
and some have other gods unknown (or known by other
names) to outsiders.
GREYHAWK
The gods of Greyhawk come from at least four different
pantheons,
representing
the faiths of the various ethnic
groups that populated lhe continent of Oerik over the
ages. As a result, there's a great deal of overlap in lheir
portfolios: Pelor is the Flan god of the sun and Pholtus
is the Oeridian sun god, for example.

"""THE
lIFE
ANO
DEATH
DOMAINS
Many deities
in this section
suggest
the Life domain,
particularly
if they are dosely
associated
with healing,
protection,
childbirth,
nurturing,
ar fertility. As described
in
the chapter
3, though,
the Life domain
is incredibly
broad,
and a deric of any non-evil deity can choose
il.
A number
of other deities,
mostly evil ones, suggest
the
Death domain,
which is detailed
in the Dungeon
Mas!er's
Cuide. Most derics
who choose
this domain
are evil N PCs,
but if you want to worship
a god af death,
consult
your
Dungeon Master .

ELIGION
ISAN
IMPORTANT
PART OF LIFE IN
THE worlds of the D&D multiverse. When
gods walk the world, clerics channel divine
power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices in
subterranean
lairs, and shining paladins
stand Iike beacons against the darkness,
it's
hard to be ambivalent about the deities and
deny thei r existence.
Many people in the worlds of D&D worship different
gods at different times and eircumstances.
People in
the Forgotten Realms, for example. might pray to Sune
for luck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before
heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when
a severe storm blows in-ali
in the same day. Many
people have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideais
and teachings they make their own. And a few people
dedicate themselves
entirely to a single god, usually
serving as a priest or champion of lhat god's ideais.
Your DM determines
which gods, if any, are worshiped
in his or her campaign. From among the gods available,
you can choose a single deity for your character to
serve, worship, or pay Iip service to. ar you can pick
a few that your character prays to most often. ar just
make a mental note of lhe gods who are revered in your
DM's campaign so you can invoke their names when
appropriate. ]f you're playing a deric or a character with
the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity
serves or served, and consider the deity's suggested
domains when selecting your character's
domain.
