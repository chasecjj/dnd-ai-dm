WARLOCK
With a pseudodragon
curled on his shoulder, a young
elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical
charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace
sentinel to his will.
As fiames spring to life in her hands, a wizened
human whispers
the secret na me of her demonic patron,
infusing her spell with fiendish magic.
Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the
odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefiing
chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a
distant world,
Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies
hidden in the fabric of the multiverse, Through pacts
made with mysterious beings of supernatural
power,
warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
spectacular.
Drawing on the ancient knowledge of
beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and
alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together
arcane secrets to bolster their own power,
SWORN AND BEHOLDEN
A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly
being, Sometimes
the relationship
between warlock
and patron is like that of a c1erie and a deity, though
the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not
gods, A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon
prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity-beings
not typically served by c1erics, More often, though, the
arrangement
is similar to that between a master and
an apprentice, The warlock learns and grows in power,
at the cost of occasional services performed
on the
patron's behalf.
The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor
but lasting alterations
to the warlock's being (such as
the ability to see in darkness
or to read any language)
to access to powerful spells, Unlike bookish wizards,
warlocks supplement
their magic with some facility
at hand-to-hand
combat. They are comfortable
in light
armor and know how to use simple weapons,
DELVERS
INTO
SECRETS
Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge
and power, which compels them into their pacts and
shapes their lives, This thirst drives warlocks into their
pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
Stories of warlocks binding themselves
to fiends are
widely known, Sut many warlocks serve patrons that
are not fiendish. Sometimes
a traveler in the wilds
comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord
or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully
aware of it. And sometimes,
while poring over tomes of

CLASS FEATURES
As a warlock,
YOll gain the following class features.
Your patron's demands
might drive you into adventures,
or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do
between adventures.
What kind of relationship
do you have with your
patron? Is it friendly. antagonistic.
uneasy. or romantic?
How important
does your patron consider you to be?
What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you
know other servants of your patron?
How does your patron communicate
with you? If
you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with
your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages
frolll their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea
leaves, or adrift in the clouds-messages
that only the
warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their
patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with
intermediaries.

mind is
opened to realities beyond the material world and to the
alien beings lhat dwell in the outer void.
Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge
and power can't be slaked with mere study and research.
No one makes a pact with such a mighty palron if he or
she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather,
the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active
pursuit of their goals. which typically means some kind
of adventuring. Furthermore,
the demands of their
patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.

CREATING
A WARLOCK
As you make your warlock character, spend some time
thinking about your patron and the obligations that
your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the
pact, and how did you make contact with your patron?
Wcrc you seduced into sumllloning
a devi!, or did you
seek out the ritual thal would allow you to make contact
with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron,
or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe
under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in
anticipation of the rewards promised to you?
Work with your DM to determine
how big a part your
pact will play in your character's
adventuring
career.
