ROGUE
Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps
forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear
to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the
lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into
the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick
the door open.
A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his
accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When
their target-a
notorious slaver-passes
the alleyway,
the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate,
and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can
make a sound.
Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers
and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt.
In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is
open, and she and her companions are free to make
their escape.
Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes'
vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation.
They have a knack for finding the solution tojust about
any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness
and
versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful
adventuring party.
SKILL AND PRECISION
Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of
a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat
abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other
characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and
deception, while others refine the skills that help them
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
disarming traps, and opening locks.
When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning
over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one
precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will
hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down
with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost
supernatural
knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn
magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.
A SHADY LIVING
Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of
them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class,
making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and
con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized
into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues
operate independently, but even they sometimes
recruit apprentices to help them in their scams
and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as

CREATING
A ROGUE
As you create your rogue character, consider the
character's
relationship
to the law. Do you have a
criminal past-or
present? Are you on the run from the
law or from an angry thieves' guild master? Or did you
leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger
rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures.
or some other desire or ideal?
What was the trigger that led you away from your
previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly
wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe
you were lucky and a successful
robbery gave you the
coin you needed to escape the squalor ofyour !ife.
Did wanderlust
finally call you away from your home?
Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your
family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means
of support. Or maybe you made a new friend-another
member of your aelventuring party-who
showeel you
new possibilities
for earning a tiving anel employing
your particular
talents.
QUICK
BUILD
You can make a rogue quickly by following
these suggestions.
First. Dexterity should
be your highest ability score. Make
Intelligence your next-highest if you want to
excel at Investigation or plan to take up the
Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma
instead if you plan to emphasize
deception and soeial
interaction. Second, choose the charlatan
background.
