Vou spent
your youlh
under
the sway of a dread
pirate,
a ruthless
cutthroat
who taught
you how to survive
in a
worId of sharks
and savages.
You've indulged
in larceny
on the high seas
and sent more
than
one deserving
soul
to a briny grave.
Fear
and bloodshed
are no strangers
to you, and you've
garnered
a somewhal
unsavory
reputation
in many
a port town.
If you decide
thal your sailing

piracy,
you can choose

feature
(see sidebar)
instead
of the Ship's
Passage
feature.

FEATURE:
SHIP'S
PASSAGE
When
you need
to, you can secure
free passage
on
a sailing
ship for yourself
and your adventuring
companions.
Vou might
sail on the ship you served
on,
or another
ship you have good relations
with (perhaps
one captained
bya
former
crewmate).
Because
you're
calling
in a favor, you can't
be certain
of a schedule
or
route
that wiII meet your every need.
Your Dungeon
Master
wiII determine
how long it takes
to get where
you need to go. In return
for your free passage,
you
and your companions
are expected
to assist
the crew
during
the voyage.
SAILOR
SUGGESTED
CHARACTERISTICS
Sailors
can be a rough
lot, but the responsibilities
of
life on a ship make
them
generally
reliable
as welI. Life
aboard
a ship shapes
their
outlook
and forms
their
most
important
attachments.

Personalily Trail
1
My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.
2
I work hard so that I can play hard when lhe work
is done.
I enjoy sailing inlo new porls and making new friends
over a flagon of ale.

I slrelch lhe Irulh for lhe sake of a good slory.
5
To me, a lavem brawl is a nice way lo gel lo know a
new cily.
6
I never pass up a friendly wager.
7
My language is as foul as an olyugh nesl.
8
Ilike a job well done, especially if I can convince
someone
else lo do il.
Vou sailed
on a seagoing
vessel
for years.
In that
time, you faced down
mighty
storms,
monsters
of the
deep, and those
who wanted
to sink your craft to the
bottomless
depths.
Your first love is the distant
line of
the horizan,
but the time has come
to try your hand
at something
new.
Discuss
the nature
of the ship you previously
sailed
with your Dungeon
Master.
Was it a merchant
ship,
a naval vessel,
a ship of discovery,
or a pirate
ship?
How famous
(or infamous)
is it? Is it widely
traveled?
Is it stiII sailing,
or is it missing
and presumed
lost
with ali hands?
What
were your duties
on board-boatswain,
capta in,
navigator,
cook, or some
other
position?
Who were
the
captain
and first mate?
Did you leave your ship on good
terms
with your fellows,
or on the run?
