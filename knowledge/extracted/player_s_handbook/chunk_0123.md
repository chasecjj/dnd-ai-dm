PROFICIENCIES
PROFICIENCIES
CLASS FEATURES
When you gain a levei in a class other than your first,
you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies,
as shown in the Multiclassing
Proficiencies
table.
UNARMORED
DEFENSE
]f you already have the Unarmored
Defense feature, you
can't gain it again from another class.
SPELLCASTING
Your capacity for spellcasting
depends partly on your
combined leveis in ali your spellcasting
classes and
partly on your individual leveis in those classes. Once
you have the Spellcasting
feature from more than one
class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the
Spellcasting
feature from only one class, you follow the
rules as described
in that class.
SpeJls Known and Prepared.
Vou determine
what spells you know and can prepare for each class
individually, as if you were a single.classed
member of
that class. ]fyou are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example,
you know three Ist.level ranger spells based on your
leveis in the ranger class. As 3rd-Ievel wizard, you know
three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten
wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when
you reached 3rd levei as a wizard) can be 2nd-levei
spells. Ifyour Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six
wizard spells from your spellbook.
Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one
of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that
class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting
focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the
spells from the class associated with that focus.
SpeJl Slots. Vou determine your available spell slots
by adding together ali your leveIs in the bard, cleric,
druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your leveis
(raunded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and
a third of your fighter or rogue leveis (rounded down)
if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster
feature. Use this total to determine
your spell slots by
consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster
table.
Ifyou have more than one spellcasting
class, this table
might give you spell slots of a levei that is higher than
the spells you know or can prepare. Vou can use those
slots, but only to cast your lower.level spells. If a lower-
levei spell that you cast, like burning bands, has an
enhanced
effect when cast using a higher.level slot, you
can use the enhanced
effect, even though you don't have
any spells of that higher leveI.
For example, if you are the aforementioned
ranger 4/
wizard 3, you count as a 5th-levei character
when
determining
your spell slots: you have four Ist.level
slots, three 2nd.level slots, and two 3rd.level slots.
However, you don't know any 3rd.level spells, nor do you
know any 2nd-levei ranger spells. Vou can use the spell
slots of those leveis to cast the spells you do know-and
potentially enhance their effects.
Pact Magie. If you have both the Spellcasting
class
feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock
class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact
Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepareu
from classes with the Spellcasting
class feature, and you
can use the spell slots you gain fram the Spellcasting
class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

When you gain a new leveI in a class, you get its features
for that leveI. A few features, however, have additional
rules when you're multiclassing:
Channel Divinity, Extra
Attack, Unarmored
Defense, and Spellcasting.
CHANNEL
DIVINITY
Ifyou already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain
a leveI in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the
Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting
the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of
it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class
levei that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if
you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity
twice between rests beca use you are high enough levei
in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use
the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity
effects available to you from your two classes.
EXTRA ATTACK
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more
than one class, the features don't add together. Vou
can't make more than two attacks with this feature
unless il says you do (as lhe fighter's version of Extra
Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation
Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you
also have Extra Attack.
