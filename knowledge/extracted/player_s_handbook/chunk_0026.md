THE WARCHIEF
MHURREN
ROUSED
HIMSELF
FROM HIS
sleeping-furs and his women and pulled a short hauberk
of heauy steel rings ouer his thick. well-muscled torso. He
usual{y rose before most of his warriors. since he had a
strong streak of human blood in him. and hefound the
daylight less bothersome than most of his tribe did. Among
the Bloody Skulls. a warrior wasjudged by his strength. his
jlerceness. and his wits. Human ancestry was no blemish
against a warrior-prauided
he was euery bit as strang.
enduring. and bloodthirsty as hisfull-blooded
kin. Half-
orcs who were weaker than their orc comrades didn't last
long among the Bloody Skulls OI' any other orc tribefor
that matter. Rut it was often true that a bit of human blood
gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning. ambition, and
self-discipline to gofar indeed. as Mhurren had. He was
master of a tribe that could muster two thousand spears.
and the strangest chiefin TlJar.

PART
I I RACES
Whether united under the leadership
of a mighty
warloek
OI' having fought to a standstill
after years
of eonfliet, ore and human tribes sometimes
form
allianees, joining forces into a larger horde lo lhe terror
of eivilized lands nearby. When lhese allianees are
sealed by marriages,
half-ores are bom. Some half-ores
rise lo beeome proud ehiefs of ore lribes, lheir human
blood giving them an edge over lheir full-blooded ore
rivaIs. Some venture inlo lhe world lo prove lheir worlh
among humans and other more civilized raees. Many of
lhese beeome advenlurers,
aehieving grealness
for lheir
mighly deeds and nOloriely for their barbarie eustoms
and savage fury.
SCARRED AND STRONG
Half-ores' grayish pigmenlation,
sloping foreheads,
juttingjaws,
prominenl leelh, and lowering builds make
their orcish herilage plain for ali lo see. Half-ores sland
belween 6 and 7 feel lall and usually weigh belween
180 and 250 pounds.
Ores regard battle sears as lokens of pride and
ornamenlal
sears as lhings of beauly. OlheI' sears,
though, mark an ore 01' half-ore as a formeI' slave 01'
a disgraeed exile. Any half-ore who has lived among
01' near ores has sears, whelher lhey are marks of
humilialion
01' of pride, reeounling their pasl exploils
and injuries. Sueh a half-ore living among humans might
display lhese sears proudly 01' hide them in shame.
THE
MARK
OF GRUUMSH
The one-eyed god Gruumsh erealed lhe ores, and even
those ores who turn away from his worship ean'l fully
escape his influenee. The same is lrue of haIf-ores.
lhough lheir human blood moderales
lhe impaet of lheir
orcish heritage. Some half-ores hear the whispers
of
Gruumsh
in lheir dreams, ealling lhem lo unleash lhe
rage tha! simmers wilhin lhem. Others feel Gruumsh's

exultation when they join in melee eombat-and
either
exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing.
Half-ores are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within
them, whether they embraee it or rebel against it.
Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-ores feel emotion
powerfully. Rage doesn't jusl quieken their pulse, it
makes their bodies burn. An insult stings tike acid,
and sadness
saps their strength.
But they laugh loudly
and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures-feasting,
drinking, wrestling, drumming,
and wild dancing-fill
their hearls with joy. They tend to be short-tempered
and sometimes
sullen, more inclined to aelion than
eontemplation
and to fighting than arguing. The mosl
aeeomplished
half-ores are lhose with enough self.
eontrol to get by in a civilized land.
TRIBES AND SLUMS
Half-ores most often live among ores. Of the other raees,
humans are most tikely to aeeept half.ores, and half.
ores almost always live in human lands when not living
among ore lribes. Whether proving themselves
among
rough barbarian
tribes or serabbling to survive in the
slums of larger cities, half-ores gel by on their physieal
might, their enduranee,
and lhe sheer determinalion
lhey inheril from lheir human aneeslry.
HALF-ORC
NAMES
Half-ores usually have names appropriate
lo the eullure
in whieh they were raised. A half-ore who wanls lo fit in
among humans mighl trade an ore name for a human
name. Some half-ores wilh human names decide to
adopt a guttural ore na me beeause they lhink it makes
lhem more intimidating.
