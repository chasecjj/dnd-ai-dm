THE
DARKNEss
OF THE
DRow
Were il nol for one renowned exceplion, lhe race of drow
would be universally reviled. lo mosl, lhey are a race of
demon-worshiping
marauders
dwelling in lhe sublerranean
deplhs of lhe Underdark, emerging only on lhe blackesl
nighls lo pillage and slaughler lhe surface dwellers lhey
despi se. lheir sociely is depraved and preoccupied wilh lhe
favor of Lollh, lheir spider-goddess,
who sanclions
murder
and lhe exlerminalion
of enlire families as noble houses
vie for posilion.
Yel one drow, alleasl,
broke lhe mold. In lhe world of lhe
Forgotten Realms, Drizzl Do'Urden, ranger of lhe North, has
proven his qualily as a good-hearted
defender of lhe weak
and innocent. Rejecling his herilage and adrift in a world lhal
looks upon him wilh lerror and loalhing, Drizzl is a model
for lhose few drow who follow in his foolsleps, lrying lo find
a life apart from lhe evil sociely oflheir Underdark homes.
Drow grow up believing lhal surface-dwelling races are
inferior, worlhless excepl as slaves. Drow who develop a
conscience or find il necessary lo cooperale wilh members of
olher races find il hard lo overcome lhal prejudice, especially
when lhey are 50 often on lhe receiving end of halred.
