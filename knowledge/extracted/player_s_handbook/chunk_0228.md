OTHER PLANES
Existing somehow between or beyond the known planes
of existence are a variety of other realms.
The planes with some element of good in their nature
are called the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such
as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes
with some element of evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends
such as demons, devils, and yugoloths dwell in the
Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its essence, and
a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's
experiences a profound sense of dissonance there.
When a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it
feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels
out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.
Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes
often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to
what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take
a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to
the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells
desire il. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a
grueling trek across a single layer.
The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of
sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments
(excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction
between them.
DEMIPLANES
Demiplanes are small extradimensional
spaces with
their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that
don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come
into being by a variety of means. Some are created by
spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a
powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally,
as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched olf
from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe
growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered
through a single point where it touches another plane.
Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers
to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required
for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The
gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows
of the demiplane.
THE
FAR REALM
The Far Realm is beyond the known muItiverse. In fact,
it might be an entirely separate multiverse with its own
physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from
the Far Realm leak onto another plane, life and matter
are warped and twisted into alien shapes that defy
ordinary geometry and biology.
The entities that abide in the Far Realm are toa alien
for a normal mind to accept without damage. Titanic
creatures swim through nothingness, preoccupied
with madness. Unspeakable things whisper awful
truths to those who dare listen. For mortais, knowledge
of the Far Realm Is a triumph of mind over the rude
boundaries of matter, space, and eventually sanity.
There are no known portaIs lo the Far Realm, or
at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once
pierced the boundary of eons with a vast portal to the
Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak,
but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and
the portaI's location-even
its home world-is
long-
forgotten. Other portaIs might still exist, marked by the
alien forces leaking through to corrupt the Material
Plane around them.
planes. That argument might be circular, however,
for it is possible that the arrangement of the Outlands
inspired the idea of the Great Wheel in the first place.
Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced,
are the gate-towns: sixleen settlements, each built
around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each
town shares many of the characteristics
of the plane
where its gate leads.
At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of the
planar wheel, the Spire shoots impossibly high into the
sky. Above this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of
Sigil, the City of Doors. This bustling planar metropolis
holds countless portais to other planes and worlds.
Sigil is a trader's city. Goods, merchandise, and
information come to it from across the planes. There
is a brisk trade in information about the planes, in
particular in the command words or items required for
the operation of particular portais. These portal keys
are highly sought after, and many travelers within the
city are looking for a particular portal or a portal key
to allow them to continue on their way.

SIGIL AND THE OUTLANDS
The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes, a
plane of neutrality, but not the neutrality of nothingness.
Instead it incorporates a little of everything, keeping it
ali in a paradoxical balance-simultaneously
concordant
and in opposition. It is a broad region of varied terrain,
with open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting,
shallow rivers, strongly resembling an ordinary world
of the Material Plane.
The Outlands is circular, like a great wheel-in
