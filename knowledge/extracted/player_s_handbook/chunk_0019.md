EVERYONE'S
SECONO-BEST
FRIENOS
Just as readily as they mix with each
other,
humans
mingle
with members
of other
races.
They get along
with almost
everyone,
though
they might
not be close
to many.
Humans
serve
as ambassadors,
diplomats,
magistrates,
merchants,
and functionaries
of ali kinds.
Dwa,ves. "They're
stout
folk, stalwart
friends,
and true to
their
word. Their greed
for gold is their downfall,
though."
Elves. "ll's best
not to wander
into elven woods.
They don't
like intruders,
and you'll
as likely be bewitched
as peppered
with arrows.
5till, if an elf can get past that damned
racial
pride
and actually
treat
you like an equal,
you can leam
a lot
from them."
Ha/flings.
"ll's
hard to beat a meal
in a halfling
home,
as
long as you don't
crack your head
on the ceiling-good
food
and good
stories
in front of a nice, warm
fire. Ifhalflings
had
a shred
of ambition,
they might
really amount
to something."

LASTING
INSTITUTIONS
Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the
responsibility of guarding a speciallocation
or a
powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and
institutions for such purposes. While dwarf c1ans and
halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each
new generation, human temples, governments, Iibraries,
and codes of law fix their lradilions in lhe bedrock of
history. Humans dream of immorlality, but (excepl for
lhose few who seek undeath or divine ascension to
escape dealh's c1utches)they achieve il by ensuring that
they will be remembered when lhey are gone.
Allhough some humans can be xenophobic, in
generallheir
societies are inclusive. Human lands
welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared lo the
proporlion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.
EXEMPLARS
OF AMBITION
Humans who seek advenlure are lhe mosl daring and
ambilious members of a daring and ambilious race.
They seek to earn glory in the eyes of lheir fellows
by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than
olhe r people, humans champion causes rather lhan
lerritories or groups.
HUMAN
NAMES AND ETHNICITIES
Having so much more variely than olher cullures,
humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human
PART
t I RACES
parents give their children names from olher languages,
such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less
correctly), bul mosl parenls give names that are Iinked
lo their region's cullure or lo lhe naming lraditions of
their ancestors.
The malerial cullure and physical characleristics
of humans can change wildly from region lo region.
In the Forgolten Realms, for example, lhe c101hing,
archileclure, cuisine, music, and Iilerature are different
in lhe norlhwestern lands of lhe Silver Marches than
in dislanl Turmish or Impillur to the easl-and
even
more dislinclive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical
characleristics,
lhough, vary according lOlhe ancient
migrations of lhe earliesl humans, so lhallhe humans
of the Silver Marches have every possible varialion of
coloralion and features.
In the Forgotten Realms, nine human elhnic groups
are widely recognized, lhough over a dozen olhers are
found in more localized areas of Faerun. These groups,
and lhe lypical names of lheir members, can be used as
inspiralion no matter which world your human is in.
CALISHITE
Shorler and slighler in build than mosI olher humans,
Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes.
They're found primarily in soulhwest Faerun.
Calishite Names: (Male) Aseir, Bardeid, Haseid.
Khemed. Mehmen. Sudeiman, Zasheir; (female)
Alala, Ceidil. Hama, Jasmal, Meilil, Seipora, Yasheira,
Zasheida; (surnames) Basha, Dumein,Jassan,
Khalid.
Moslana. Pashar, Rein
CHONDATHAN
Chondalhans are slender, lawny-skinned folk wilh
brown hair that ranges from almosl blond lo almost
black. Most are tall and have green or brown eyes,
but lhese trails are hardly universal. Humans of
Chondalhan descenl dominale the centrallands
of
Faerun, around the Inner Sea.
