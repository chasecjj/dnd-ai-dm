BARD COLLEGES
The way Dfa bard is gregarious.
Bards seek each
other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their
accomplishments,
and share their knowledge. Bards
form loose associations,
which they call colleges, to
facilitate their gatherings
and preserve their traditions.
COLLEGE
OF LORE
Bards Dfthe College of Lore know something
about
most things, collecting bits Dfknowledge from sources
as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales.
Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
compositions
in royal courts, these bards use their gifts
to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies
down, the audience members might find themselves
questioning
everything they held to be true, from their
faith in the priesthood
of the localtemple
to their
loyalty to the king.
The loyalty Dfthese bards Iies in the pursuit Dfbeauty
and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the
tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a
herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be
honest than politic.
The college's members gather in libraries and
sometimes
in actual colleges, complete with classrooms
and dormitories,
to share their lore with one another.
They also meet at festivaIs or affairs of state, where they
can expose corruption,
unravellies,
and poke fun at self-
important
figures of authority.
