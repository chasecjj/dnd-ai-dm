PREFACE
NCE UPON A TIME,
LONG, LONG AGO, IN A
realm called the Midwestern United
States-specifically
the states of Minne-
sota and Wisconsin-a
group of friends
gathered together to forever alter the
history of gaming.
1twasn't their intent to do so. They were
tired of merely reading tales about worlds of magic,
monsters,
and adventure. They wanted to play in those
worlds, rather than observe them. That they went on
to invent OUNGEONS
& ORAGONS,
and thereby ignite a
revolution in gaming that continues
to this day, speaks
to two things.
First, it speaks to their ingenuity and genius in fig-
uring out that games were the perfect way to explore
worlds that could not otherwise
exist. Almost every
modern game, whether played on a digital device or
a tabletop, owes some debt to 0&0.
Second, it is a testament
to the inherent appeal of the
game they created.
OUNGEONS
& ORAGONS sparked a
thriving global phenomenon.
[t is the first roleplaying
game, and it remains one of the best of its breed.
To play 0&0. and to play it well, you don't need to
read ali the rules, memorize every detail of the game,
or master the fine art of rolling funny looking dice.
None of those things have any bearing on what's best
about the game.
What you need are two things, the first being friends
with whom you can share the game. Playing games with
your friends is a lot of fun, but 0&0 does something
more than entertain.
Playing 0&0 is an exerci se in collaborative creation.
Vou and your friends create epic stories filled with ten-
sion and memorable drama. Vou create silly in-jokes
that make you laugh years later. The dice will be cruel
to you. but you will soldier on. Your collective creativ-
ity will build stories that you will tell again and again.
ranging from the utlerly absurd to the stuff of legend.
If you don't have friends interested
in playing, don't
worry. There's a special alchemy that takes place
around a 0&0 table thal nothing else can match. Play
the game with someone enough, and the two of you
PREFACE
are !ikely to end up friends. It's a cool side effect of the
game. Your next gaming group is as close as the nearest
game store, on!ine forum, or gaming convention.
The second thing you need is a lively imagination
or, more importantly, the willingness
to use whatever
imagination you have. Vou don't need to be a master
storyteller or a brilliant artist. Voujust need to aspire to
create, to have the courage of someone who is willing to
build something
and share it with others.
Luckily. just as 0&0 can strengthen
your friendships,
it can help build in you the confidence to create and
share. 0&0 is a game that teaches you to look for the
clever solution, share the sudden idea that can overcome
a problem, and push yourself to imagine what could be,
rather than simply accept what is.
The first characters
and adventures
you create will
probably be a collection of clichés. That's true of every-
one, from the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on
down. Accept this rea!ity and move on to create the
second character
or adventure, which will be betler,
and then the third, which will be betler still. Repeat that
over the course of time, and soon you'lI be able to create
anything, from a character's
background
story to an epic
world of fantasy adventure.
Once you have that skill, it's yours forever. Countless
writers, artists, and other creators can trace their begin-
nings to a few pages of 0&0 notes, a handful of dice,
and a kitchen table.
Above ali else, 0&0 is yours. The friendships you
make around the table will be unique to you. The adven-
tures you embark on. the characters
you create, the
memories you make-these
will be yours. 0&0 is your
personal corner of the universe, a place where you have
free reign to do as you wish.
Go forth now. Read the rules of the game and the
story of its worlds, but always remember
that you are
the one who brings them to !ife. They are nothing
without the spark of !ife that you give them.
