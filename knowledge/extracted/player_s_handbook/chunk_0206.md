or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature
from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.
If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell
that affects an enemy creature,
this spell ends.
On a successful
save. the target isn't affected. and you
can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
On a failed save. the spell creates an invisible sensor
within 10 feet of the target. Vou can see and hear through
the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with
lhe target, remaining
within 10 feet of it for the duration.
A creature
that can see invisible objects sees the sensor
as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

When you do, the sensor appcars al that location and
doesn't move.

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon

Id6 tire damage to the target and causes the target to
ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until
the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, it takes Id6 tire damage.
On a successful save, the spell ends. lf the target or a
creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the
flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such
as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.

SEEMING
5th./evel iJJusion
Casting Time: I action
Range: 30 feet
Components:
V,S
Duration: 8 hours
This spell allows you to change the appearance of any
number of creatures that you can see within range. Vou
give each target you choose a new, iIIusory appearance.
An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw,
and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
The spell disguises physical appearance as well as
clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. Vou can make
each creature seem I foot shorter or taller and appear
thin, fat, or in between. Voucan't change a target's body
type, so you must choose a form that has the same
basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of
the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration,
unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, ifyou use this spell
to add a hat to a creature's outtit, objects pass through
the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing
or would feel the creature's head and hair. Ifyou use
this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of

someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into
you while it was seemingly still in midair.
A creature can use its action to inspect a target and
make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the
target is disguised.

Vou send a short message of twenty-tive words or
less to a creature with which you are familiar. The
creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes
you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a
like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures
with Intelligence scores of at least I to understand the
meaning of your message.
Voucan send the message across any distance and
even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a
different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that
the message doesn't arrive.

can be hidden away, safe from detection for the
duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target,
it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination
spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by
divination spells.
If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of
suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it
doesn't grow older.
