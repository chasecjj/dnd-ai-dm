table provides a quick reference for what qualities
are measured
by each ability, what races increases
which abilities, and what classes consider each ability
particularly
importan!.
Vou generate your character's
six ability scores
randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of
the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do
this five more times, so that you have six numbers.
If
you want to save time or don't like the idea of randomly
determining
ability scores, you can use the following
scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10,8.
Now take your six numbers and write each number
beside one of your character's
six abilities to assign
scores to Strength,
Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes
to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.
After assigning your ability scores, determine
your ability modifiers
using the Ability Scores and
Modifiers table. To determine
an ability modifier without
consulting the table, subtract 10 fram the ability score
and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the
modifier next to each of your scores.
BUILDING
BRUENOR,
STEP 3
Bob decides to use the standard
set of scores (15, 14,
13, 12, 10,8) for Bruenor's abilities. Since he's a fighter,
he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength.
His next-
highest, 14, goes in Constitution.
Bruenor might be a
brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to
be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent
scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his
racial benefits (increasing
Bruenor's Constitution
by
2 and his Strength
by 2), Bruenor's ability scores and
modifiers look like this: Strength
17 (+3), Dexterity 10
(+0), Constitution
16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-I), Wisdom 13
(+1),Charisma
12 (+1).
Bob fills in Bruenor's final hit points: 10 + his
Constitution
modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.
VARIANT:
CUSTOMIZING
ABILITY
SCORES
At your Dungeon Master's option, you can use this
variant for determining
your ability scores. The method
described
here allows you to build a character
with a set
of ability scores you choose individually.
Vou have 27 points to spend on your ability scores.
The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score
Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7
points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score
you can end up with, before applying racial increases.
Vou can't have a score lower than 8.
This method of determining
ability scores enables
you to create a set of three high numbers and three low
ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above

4. DESCRIBE
YOUR CHARACTER
Dnce you know the basic game aspects of your
character, it's time to f1esh him or her out as a person.
Your character
needs a name. Spend a few minutes
thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or
she behaves in general terms.
Using the information in chapter 4, you can f1esh out
your character's
physical appearance
and personality
traits. Choose your character's
alignment
(the moral
compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideaIs.
Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your
character
holds most dear, called bonds, and the ftaws
that could one day undermine
him or her.
Your character's
background
describes
where he or
she carne from, his or her original occupation, and the
character's
place in the D&D world. Your DM might
offer additional backgrounds
beyond the ones included
