Much of what your character
does in the game depends
on his ar her six abilities: Strength,
Dexterity,
Constitution,
Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma.
Each ability has a score, which is a number you record
on your character
sheet.
The six abilities and their use in the game are
described
in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary

BRUENOR,
STEP 2
Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battIe with an axe,
one horo on his helmet broken ofr. He makes Bruenor a
fighter and notes the fighter's proficiencies and 1st-leveI
c1ass features on his character
sheet.
As a 1st-leveI fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die-a
d10-
and starts with hit points equal to la + his Constitution
modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final
number after he determines
Bruenor's Constitution
score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus
for a 1st-levei character, which is +2.
PROFICIENCY
BONUS
The table that appears
in your c1ass description
shows
your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-Ievel
character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the
numbers you'lI be recording on your character
sheet:
Attack rolls using weapons you're proficient with
Attack rolls with spells you cast
Ability checks using skills you're proficient in
Ability checks using tools you're proficient with
Saving throws you're proficient in
Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in
each spellcasting
c1ass)
Your c1ass determines
your weapon proficiencies,
your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill
and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described
in chapter 7,
tools in chapter 5.) Your background
gives you additional
skill and toa I proficiencies, and some races give
you more proficiencies. Be sure to note ali of these
proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your
character
sheet.
Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die
roll ar other number more than once. Occasionally, your
proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled ar halved,
for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance
suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than
once to the same roll ar that it should be multiplied
more than once, you nevertheless
add it only once,
multiply it only once, and halve it only once.
At 1st levei, your character
has 1 Hit Die, and the
die type is determined
by your c1ass. Vou start with hit
points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in
your c1ass description.
(You also add your Constitution
modifier, which you'lI determine
in step 3.) This is also
your hit poiot maximum.
Record your character's
hit points on your character
sheet. AIso record the type of Hit Die your character
uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you
rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see
"Resting" in chapter 8).
