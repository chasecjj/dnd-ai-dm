OVERCHANNEL
Starting at 14th levei, you can increase the power of
your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of
5th levei ar lower that deals damage, you can deal
maximum damage with that spell.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect.
Ifyou use this feature again before you finish a long
rest, you take 2d 12 necrotic damage for each levei of
the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you
use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the
necrotic damage per spelllevel
increases
by ldl2. This
damage ignores resistance
and immunity.
SCHOOL
OF ILLUSION
Vou focus your studies on magic that dazzles the
senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest
folk. Your magic is subtle, but the ilIusions crafted by
your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some
illusionists-including
many gnome wizards-are
benign tricksters
who use their spells to entertain.
Others are more sinister masters of deception, using
their ilIusions to frighten and fool others for their
personal gain.
ILLUSION
SAVANT
Beginning when you se1ect this school at 2nd levei, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell
into your spellbook is halved.
IMPROVED
MINOR
ILLUSION
When you choose this school at 2nd levei, you learn
the minor illusion cantrip. lf you already know this
cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your
PART
1 I CLASSES
choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number
of cantrips
known.
When you cast minar illusian, yau can create bath a
saund and an image with a single casting of the spell.
MALLEABLE
ILLUSIONS
Starting at 6th levei, when you cast an illusion spell that
has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use yaur
action to change the nature of that illusion (using the
spell's normal parameters
for lhe illusion), provided that
you can see the illusion.
ILLUSORY
SELF
Beginning at 10th levei, you can create an illusory
duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual
reaction to danger. When a creature
makes an attack
roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose
the illusory duplicate between the attacker and
yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the
ilIusion dissipates.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again untU
you finish a short ar long rest.
ILLUSORY
REALITY
By 14th levei, you have learned the secret ofweaving
shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-
reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st levei or
higher, you can choose one inanimate,
nonmagical
object that is part of the illusion and make that object
real. Vou can do this on your turn as a bonus action
while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for
I minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a
bridge over a chasm and then make it reallong
enough
for your allies to cross.
The object can't deal damage or otherwise
directly harm anyone.
SCHOOL
OF NECROMANCY
The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces
of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in
this tradition, you learn to manipulate
the energy that
animates
allliving things. As you progress, you learn to
sap the life force fram a creature
as your magic destrays
its bady, transforming
that vital energy into magical
power you can manipulate.
Most people see necramancers
as menacing, or even
villainous, due to the dose association
with death.
Not all necramancers
are evil, but the forces they
manipulate
are considered
taboo by many societies.
NECROMANCY
SAVANT
Beginning when you se1ect this school at 2nd levei, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy
spell into your spellbook is halved.
GRIM
HARVEST
At 2nd levei, you gain the ability to reap life energy from
creatures
you kill with your spells. Once per turn when
you kill one ar more creatures
with a spell of 1st levei
or higher, yau regain hit points equal to twice the spell's
levei, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the
School of Necramancy. Vou don't gain this benefit for
killing constructs
or undead.
