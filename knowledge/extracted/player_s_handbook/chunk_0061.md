and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness
that would swallow il. Where life fiourishes, stand
against the forces that would render it barren.

CHANNEL
DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd leveI, you gain the
following two Channel Divinity options.
Nature's Wrath. Vou can use your Channel Divinity
to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action,
you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach
for a creature
within 10 feet ofyou that you can see.
The creature
must succeed on a Strength
or Dexterity
saving throw (its choice) or be restrained.
While
restrained
by the vines, the creature
repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it
frees itself and the vines vanish.
Turn the Faithless. Vou can use your Channel
Divinity to utler ancient words that are painful for fey
and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy
symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that
can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature
is turned for 1 minute or until it
takes damage.
A turned creature
must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. lt also can't take
reactions.
For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape fram an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature
can use
the Dodge action.
If the creature's
true form is concealed by an illusion,
shapeshifting,
or other effect, lhat form is revealed while
it is turned.
AURA OF WARDING
Beginning at 7th leveI, ancient magic lies so heavily
upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. Vou and friendly
creatures
within 10 feet of you have resistance
to
damage from spells.
At 18th leveI, the range of this aura increases to 30 feel.
UNDYING
SENTINEL
Starting at 15th leveI, when you are reduced to O hit
points and are not killed oUlright, you can choose to
drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you
can't use it again until you finish a long resl.
Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks
of old
age, and you can't be aged magically.
ELDER CHAMPION
At 20th levei, you can assume the form of an ancient
force of nature, taking on an appearance
you choose.
For example, your skin might turn green or take on a
bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-
like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.
Using your action, you undergo a transformation.
For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
At the start of each ofyour turns, you rega in 10 hit
points.
Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting
time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action
instead.
Enemy creatures
within 10 feet of you have disadvan-
tage on saving throws against your paladin spells and
Channel Divinity options.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a long resl.
OATH
OF VENGEANCE
The Oath ofVengeance
is a solemn commitment
to
punish those who have commitled a grievous sino When
evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire
people turns against the will of the gods. when a thieves'
guild grows toa violent and powerful, when a dragon
rampages
through the countryside-at
times like these,
paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set
right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins-
sometimes
called avengers or dark knights-their
own
purity is not as important
as delivering justice.
