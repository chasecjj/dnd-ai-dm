Personality
Trait
1
I'm driven
by a wanderlust
that led me away
from home.

as if they were a litter of
newborn
pups.

miles without
stopping
to warn
to my e1an of an approaehing
ore horde.
I'd do it again
if I had to.
4
I have a lesson
for every situation,
drawn
from
observing
nature.
S
I plaee no stoek in wealthy or well-mannered
folk.
Money and manners
won't
save you from a hungry
owlbear.

I'm always pieking things
up, absently
fiddling with
them,
and sometimes
aeeidentally
breaking
them.

around
animais
than
people.

Bond
1
My family, e1an, or tribe is the most

destroyed
my homeland.

enter
