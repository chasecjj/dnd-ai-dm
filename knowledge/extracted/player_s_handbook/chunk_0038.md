DIVINITY:
TURN
UNDEAD
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
prayer censuring
the undead. Each undead that can see
or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If the creature
fails its saving throw, it is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
A turned creature
must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. lt also can't take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature
can use
the Dodge action.

domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you
choose one aspect of your deity's portfolio to emphasize,
and you are granted powers related to that domain.
Your choice might correspond
to a particular
sect
dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be
worshiped
in one region as Phoebus ("radiant") Apollo,
emphasizing
his influence over the Light domain,
and in a different place as Apollo Acesius ("healing"),
emphasizing
his association
with the Life domain.
Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a
malter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity
that appeals to you most.
Each domain's description
gives examples of deities
who have influence over that domain. Gods are included
from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk,
Dragonlance,
and Eberron campaign seltings, as well as
from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons
of antiquity.
