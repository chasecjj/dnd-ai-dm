CHAPTER 1: STEP-By-STEP
CHARACTERS
OURFIRSTSTEPINPLAYINGANADVENTURER
INTHE
DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame is to imagine
and create a character
of your own. Your
character
is a combination of game statistics,
roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. Vou
choose a race (such as human or halfling) and
a class (such as fighter or wizard). Vou also
invent the personality, appearance,
and backstory of
your character. Once completed, your character
serves
as your representative
in the game, your avatar in the
DUNGEONS& DRAGONSworld.
Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the
kind of adventurer you want to play. Vou might be a
courageous
fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or
a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested
in an unconventional
character, such as a brawny rogue
who likes hand-to-hand
combat, or a sharpshooter
who
picks of[ enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction
featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character
of
one of those races. Do you want your character
to be the
toughest adventurer
at the table? Consider a class like
barbarian
or paladin.lfyou
don't know where else to
begin, take a look at the illustrations
in this book to see
what catches your interest.
Once you have a character
in mind, follow these steps
in order, making decisions that reflect the character you
want. Your conception of your character
might evolve
with each choice you make. What's important
is that you
come to the table with a character you're excited to play.
Throughout
this chapter, we use the term character
sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character,
whether it's a formal character
sheet (like the one at the
end of this book), some form of digital record, or a piece
of notebook paper. An official 0&0 character
sheet is a
fine place to start until you know what information you
need and how you use it during the game.
BUILDING
BRUENOR
Each step of character
creation includes an example of
that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf
character, Bruenor.
1. CHOOSE
A RACE
Every character
belongs to a race, one of the many
intelligent humanoid species in the 0&0 world. The
most common player character
races are dwarves, elves,
halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces,
such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 provides
more information
about these races, as well as the less
widespread
races of dragonborn,
gnomes, half-elves,
half-orcs, and tieflings.
The race you choose contributes to your character's
identity in an important way, by establishing
a general
appearance
and the natural talents gained from culture
and ancestry. Your character's
race grants particular
racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with
certain weapons or toois, proficiency in one or more
skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits
sometimes
dovetail with the capabilities of certain
classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of
lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and
high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes
playing against type can be fun, too. Half-orc paladins
and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be
unusual but memorable characters.
Your race also increases
one or more of your ability
scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these
increases
and remember to apply them later.
Record the traits granted by your race on your
character
sheet. Be sure to note your starting
languages
and your base speed as well.
BUILDING
BRUENOR,
STEP I
Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides
that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character
he wants
to play. He notes ali the racial traits of dwarves on his
character
sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the
languages
he knows: Common and Dwarvish.
2. CHOOSE
A CLASS
Every adventurer
is a member of a class. Class broadly
describes
a character's
vocation, what special talents he
or she possesses,
and the tactics he or she is most likely
to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters,
or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character
classes are described
in chapter 3.
Your character
receives a number of benefits from
your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class
features-capabilities
(including spellcasting)
that set
your character
apart from members of other classes.
Vou also gain a number of proficiencies:
armor,
weapons, skills, saving throws, and some times tools.
Your proficiencies define many of the things your
character
can do particularly
well, from using certain
weapons to telling a convincing lie.
On your character
sheet, record ali the features that
your class gives you at 1st leveI.
LEVEL
Typically, a character
starts at 1st levei and advances
in levei by adventuring
and gaining experience
points
(XP). A 1st-levei character
is inexperienced
in the
adventuring
world, although he or she might have been
a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous
things before.
Starting
of[ at 1st levei marks your character's
entry
into the adventuring
life. If you're already familiar
with the game, or ifyou arejoining
an existing 0&0
campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a
higher levei, on the assumption
that your character
has
already survived a few harrowing
adventures.
