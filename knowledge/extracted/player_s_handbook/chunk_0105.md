FEATURE:
RESEARCHER
When you atlempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, ifyou
do not know that information, you often know where and
fram whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information
comes from a !ibrary, scriptorium, university, or a sage
or other learned person or creature, Your DM might
rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an
almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be
found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse
can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.
SUGGESTED
CHARACTERISTICS
Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their
characteristics
reflect this !ife of study. Devoted to
scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly-
sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means
toward other ideaIs.
