Vou conjure a mass of thiek, stieky webbing at a point of
your ehoice within range, The webs fill a 20-foot eube
from that point for the duration, The webs are diffieult
terrain and lightly obseure their area.
If the webs aren't anehored
between two solid masses
(sueh as walls or trees) or layered aeross a floar, wall,
or eeiling, the eonjured web eollapses on itself, and the
spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered
over a flat surfaee have a depth of 5 feel.
Eaeh ereature
that starts its turn in the webs or that
enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the ereature
is restrained
as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
A ereature
restrained
by the webs ean use its aetion to
make a Strength
eheek against your spell save De. If it
sueeeeds,
it is no longer restrained.
The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot eube of webs
exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire
damage to any ereature
that starts its turn in the /ire.
