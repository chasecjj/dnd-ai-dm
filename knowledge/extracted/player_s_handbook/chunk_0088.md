UNDEAD
THRALLS
At 6th levei, you add the animate dead spell to your
spellbook if it is not there already, When you cast
animate dead, you can target one additional corpse
or pile of bones, creating another zombie or ske1eton,
as appropriate,
Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy
spell, it has additional benefits:
The creature's
hit point maximum is increased
byan
amount equal to your wizard leveI.
The creature
adds your proficiency bonus to its
weapon damage rolls,
INURED
TO UNDEATH
Beginning at 10th levei, you have resistance
to necrotic
damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced.
Vou have spent so much time dealing with undead and
the forces that animate them that you have become
inured to some of their worst effects.
COMMAND
UNDEAD
Starting at 14th levei, you can use magic to bring
undead under your control, even those created by other
wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that
you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature
must
make a Charisma
saving throw against your wizard
spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature
on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and
obeys your commands
until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way.
If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has
advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving
throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can
repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it
succeeds and breaks free.
SCHOOL OF TRANSMUTATION
Vou are a student of spells that modify energy and matler.
To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently
mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change.
Vou wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both
physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives
you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.
Some transmuters
are tinkerers
and pranksters,
turning people into toads and transforming
copper into
silver for fun and occasional
profit. Others pursue their
magical studies with deadly seriousness,
seeking the
power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.
TRANSMUTATION
SAVANT
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd levei, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation
spell into your spellbook is halved.
MINaR
ALCHEMY
Starting at 2nd levei when you select this school, you
can temporarily alter the physical properties
of one
nonmagical
object, changing it from one substance
into
another. Vou perform a special alchemical procedure
on one object composed entire1y of wood, stone (but not
a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming
it into
a different one of those materiais.
For each 10 minutes
you spend performing
the procedure, you can transform
up to I cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you
lose your concentration
(as if you were concentrating
on
a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
TRANSMUTER'S
STONE
Starting at 6th levei, you can spend 8 hours creating a
transmuter's
stone that stores transmutation
magic. Vou
can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another
creature. A creature
gains a benefit of your choice
as long as the stone is in the creature's
possession.
When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the
following options:
Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described
in
chapter 8
An increase to speed of lO feet while the creature
is
unencumbered
Proficiency in Constitution
saving throws
Resistance
to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder
damage (your choice whenever you choose this
benefit)
Each time you cast a transmutation
spell of Ist levei
or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the
stone is on your person.
If you create a new transmuter's
stone, the previous
one ceases to function.
SHAPECHANGER
At 10th levei, you add the polymorph spell to your
spellbook, if it is not there already. Vou can cast
polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you
do so, you can target only yourself and transform
into a
beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.
Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can't do so
again until you finish a short or long rest, though you
can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
MASTER TRANSMUTER
Starting at 14th levei, you can use your action to
consume the reserve of transmutation
magic slored
within your transmuter's
stone in a single burst. When
you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your
transmuter's
stone is destroyed and can'l be remade
until you finish a long rest.
M'lÍor Transfarmatian.
Vou can transmute
one
nonmagical object-no
larger than a 5.fool cube-inlo
another nonmagical
object of similar size and mass and
of equal or lesse r value. Vou must spend 10 minutes
handling the object lOlransform
it.
Panacea. Vou remove ali curses, diseases, and poisons
affecting a crealure that you touch with the transmuter's
stone. The creature also regains ali its hit points.
Restare Life. Vou cast the raise dead spell on a
creature you touch with the transmuter's
stone, without
expending a spell si01 or needing to have the spell in
your spellbook.
Restare
Yauth. Vou touch the transmuter's
stone to
a willing creature,
and that creature's
apparent age is
reduced by 3dlO years, to a minimum of 13 years. This
effect doesn't extend lhe creature's
lifespan.
