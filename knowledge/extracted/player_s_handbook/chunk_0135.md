Encountering
Creatures.
If the DM determines
that the adventurers
eneounter other ereatures
while
they're traveling, it's up to both groups to decide what
happens next. Either group might decide to attaek,
initiate a eonversation,
run away, or wait to see what the
other group does.
Surprising
Foes. If the adventurers
eneounter a
hostile ereature
or group, the DM determines
whether
the adventurers
or their foes might be surprised
when
eombat erupts. See ehapter 9 for more about surprise.
OTHER
ACTIVITIES
Charaeters
who turn their attention to other tasks as the
group travels are not foeused on watehing for danger.
These eharaeters
don't eontribute their passive Wisdom
(Pereeption) seores to the group's chance of noticing
hidden threats. However, a eharaeter
not watehing for
danger ean do one of the following aetivities instead, or
some other aetivity with the DM's permission.
Navigate. The eharaeter
ean try to prevent the group
from beeoming 10st, making a Wisdom (Survival) eheek
when the DM ealls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Cuide
has rules to determine
whether the group gets lost.)
Drawa Map. The eharaeter
ean draw a map
that reeords the group's progress
and helps the
eharaeters
get baek on eourse if they get 10st. No ability
eheek is required.
Track. A eharaeter
ean follow the traeks of another
ereature, making a Wisdom (Survival) eheek when the
DM ealls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Cuide has rules
for traeking.)
Forage. The eharaeter
ean keep an eye out for ready
sourees of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival)
eheek when the DM ealls for it. (The Dungeon Master's
Cuide has rules for foraging.)
THE ENVIRONMENT
By its nature, adventuring
involves delving into plaees
that are dark, dangerous,
and full of mysteries to be
explored. The rules in this seetion eover some of the
most important ways in whieh adventurers
interaet with
the environment
in sueh plaees. The Dungeon Master's
Cuide has rules eovering more unusual situations.
FALLING
A fali from a great height is one of the most eommon
hazards
facing an adventurer.
At the end of a fali, a ereature
takes Id6 bludgeoning
damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6.
The ereature
lands prone, unless it avoids taking
damage from the fali.
SUFFOCATING
A ereature
ean hold its breath for a number of minutes
equal to I + its Constitution
modifier (minimum
of 30 seeonds).
When a ereature runs out of breath, it ean survive for
a number of rounds equal to its Constitution
modifier
(minimum
I round). At the start of its next turn, it drops
to Ohit points and is dying.

SPLITTING

THE
PARTY
Sometimes,
it makes
sense
to split an adventuring
party,
espeeially
if you wanl one or more
eharaelers

You ean form mulliple
parties,
eaeh moving
at a different
speed.

For example, a ereature with a Constitution
of 14 ean
hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffoeating. it
has 2 rounds to reaeh air before it drops to Ohit points.
VISION
AND LIGHT
The most fundamental
tasks of adventuring-noticing
danger, finding hidden objeets, hitting an enemy in
eombat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few-
rely heavily on a eharaeter's
ability to see. Darkness
and other effeets that obseure vision can prove a
signifieant hindranee.
A given area might be Iightly or heavily obseured.
In
a Iightly obscured
area, sueh as dim light, patehy fog,
or moderate foliage, ereatures
have disadvantage
on
Wisdom (Pereeption) eheeks that rely on sight.
A heavi1y obscured
area-sueh
as darkness,
opaque
fog, or dense foliage-bloeks
vision entireIy. A ereature
in a heavily obseured area effeetively suffers from the
blinded eondition (see appendix A).
The presenee
or absenee of Iight in an environment
ereates three eategories of illumination: bright Iight, dim
Iight, and darkness.
Bright Iight lets most ereatures
see normally. Even
gloomy days provide bright light, as do torehes, lanterns,
fires, and other sourees of illumination within a
specifie radius.
Dim Iight, also ealled shadows, ereates a Iightly
obseured area. An area of dim Iight is usually a
boundary between a souree of bright Iight, sueh as
a toreh, and surrounding
darkness.
The soft Iight
of twilight and dawn also eounts as dim Iight. A
particularly
brilliant full moon might bathe the land
in dim Iight.
Darkness
ereates a heavily obseured area. Charaeters
face darkness
outdoors at night (even most moonlit
nights). within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a
subterranean
vault, or in an area of magieal darkness.
BLlNDSIGHT
A ereature with blindsight ean pereeive its surroundings
without relying on sight, within a specifie radius.
Creatures
without eyes, sue h as oozes, and ereatures
with eeholoeation
or heightened senses, sueh as bats
and true dragons, have this sense.
DARKVISION
Many ereatures
in the worlds of O&D, espeeially those
that dwell underground.
have darkvision. Within a
specified range, a ereature with darkvision ean see in
