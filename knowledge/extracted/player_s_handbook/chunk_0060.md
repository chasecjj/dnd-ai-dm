BREAKING
YOUR
OATH
A paladin tries to hold to the highest
standards
of conduct,
but even the most virtuous
paladin
is fallible. Sometimes
the right path proves toa demanding,
sometimes
a situation
calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes
the heat of
emotion
causes
a paladin
to transgress
his ar her oath.
A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution
fram a eleric who shares
his ar her faith ar from another
paladin
of the same arder. The paladin
might spend
an ali.
night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence,
ar undertake
a
fast ar similar act of self.denia!.
After a rite of confession
and
forgiveness,
the paladin
starts fresh.
If a paladin willfully violates
his ar her oath and shows
no
sign of repentance,
the consequences
can be more serious.
At the DM's discretion,
an impenitent
paladin
might be
forced to abandon
this elass and adopt
another,

good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of
