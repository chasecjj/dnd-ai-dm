When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the
following things in mind:
Describe your character's
emotions and altitude.
Focus on your character's
intent and how others
might perceive it.
Provide as much embellishment
as you feel
comfortable with.
Don't worry about getting things exactly right.Just
focus on thinking about what your character would do
and describing what you see in your mind.
ACTIVE ApPROACH
TO ROLEPLAYING
If descriptive roleplaying teUs your DM and your fellow
players what your character
thinks and does, active
roleplaying shows them.
When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your
character's voice, like an actor taking on a role. Voumight
even echo your character's movements and body language.
This approach
is more immersive than descriptive
roleplaying, though you still need to describe
things
that can't be reasonably
acted out.
Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek
above, here's how the scene might play out if Chris used
active roleplaying:
Speaking
as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice,
"I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here.
If I wanted to hear anything out of you, l'd snap your
arm and enjoy your screams."
In his normal voice, Chris
then adds, "I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar."
RESULTS OF ROLEPLAYING
The DM uses your character's
actions and attitudes to
determine
how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles
under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to
let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up f1attery.
When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to
the DM's portrayal of the NPC's mood, dialogue, and
personality. Vou might be able to determine
an NPC's
personality
traits, ideais, f1aws, and bonds, then play on
them to influence the NPC's attitude.
Interactions
in 0&0 are much like interactions
in
reallife.
Ifyou can offer NPCs something
they want,
threaten them with something
they fear, or play on their
sympathies
and goals, you can use words to get almost
anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a
proud warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your efforts
to convince or deceive will fali short.
ABILITY
CHECKS
In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in
determining
the outcome of an interaction.
Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's altitude,
but there might still be an element of chance in the
situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma
check at any point during an interaction if he or she
wants the dice to play a role in determining
an NPC's
reactions. Other checks might be appropriate
in certain
situations,
at your DM's discretion.
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking
of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack
the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies
PART 2 I ADVENTURING
on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to
trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue
who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the
discussion.
When negotiating for a hostage's release,
the cleric with Persuasion
should do most of the talking.
RESTING
Heroic though they might be, adventurers
can't spend
every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social
interaction, and combato They need rest-time
to
sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds
and spirits for spellcasting,
and brace themselves
for
further adventure.
Adventurers
can take short rests in the midst of an
adventuring
day and a long rest to end the day.
SHORT REST
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least I hour long,
during which a character
does nothing more strenuous
than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.
A character
can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end
of a short rest, up to the character's
maximum number
of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's
leveI. For
each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die
and adds the character's
Constitution
modifier to it. The
character
regains hit points equal to the total. The player
can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.
A character
regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing
a long rest, as explained below.
LONG REST
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8
hours long, during which a character
sleeps or performs
light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch
for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted
by a
period of strenuous
activity-at
least 1 hour of walking,
fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring
activity-
the characters
must begin the rest again to gain any
benefit from it.
At the end of a long rest, a character
regains alllost
hit points. The character
also regains spent Hit Dice, up
to a number of dice equal to half of the character's
total
number of them. For example, if a character
has eight
Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon
finishing a long resto
A character
can't benefit from more than one long rest
in a 24-hour period, and a character
must have at least
1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
BETWEEN AnVENTURES
Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient
evils, adventurers
need time to rest, recuperate,
and
prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers
also
use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting
arms and armor, performing
research,
or spending
their hard-earned
gold.
In some cases, the passage of time is something
that
occurs with little fanfare or description.
When starting
a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a
certain amount oftime has passed and allowyou to
