can see within range. The guardian occupies that space
and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield
emblazoned
with the symbol of your deity.
Any creature
hostile to you that moves to a space
within lO feet of the guardian
for the first time on a
turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The

Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components:
V, S, M (burning incense, a small
measure
of brimstone and oil, a knotled string, a
small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver
rod worth at least 10 gp)
Duration:
24 hours
Vou create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet
of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred
5-foot squares or twenty-five lO-foot squares). The
warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you
desire. Vou can ward several stories of a stronghold
by
dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk
into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.
When you cast this spell, you can specify individuais
that are unaffected by any or ali of the effects that
you choose. Vou can also specify a password
that,
when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to
these effects.
Guards and wards creates the following effects within
the warded area.
Corridors. Fog fills ali the warded corridors,
making
them heavily obscured.
In addition, at each intersection
or branching
passage offering a choice of direction,
there is a 50 percent chance that a creature
other than
you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from
the one it chooses.
Doors. Ali doors in the warded area are magically
locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition,
you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent
to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell)
to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
Stairs. Webs fill ali stairs in the warded area from top
to botlom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10
minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards
and wards lasts.
Other SpelJ Effect. Vou can place your choice of one
of the following magical effects within the warded area
of the stronghold.
Place dancing lights in four corridors. Vou can desig-
nate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as
guards and wards lasts.
Place magic mouth in two locations.
Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors
appear in the places you designate; they return within
10 minutes if dispersed
by wind while guards and
wards lasts.
Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.
PART
3 I SPELLS
Place a suggestion in one location. Vou select an area
of up to 5 feet square, and any creature
that enters
or passes through the area receives the suggestion
mentally.
The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel
magic cast on a specific effect, if successful,
removes
only that effect.
Vou can create a permanently
guarded and warded
structure
by casting this spell there every day
for one year.
