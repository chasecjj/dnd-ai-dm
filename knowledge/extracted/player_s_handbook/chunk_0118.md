FOOD,
DRINK,
AND LODGING
The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for
individual food items and a single night's lodging. These
prices are included in your totallifestyle
expenses.
ComfortabJe. Choosing a comfortable
lifestyle
means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily
maintain your equipment. Vou live in a small cottage
in a middle-class
neighborhood
or in a private room
at a fine inn. Vou associate with merchants,
skilled
tradespeople,
and military officers.
Wea1thy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a
life of !uxury, though you might not have achieved the
social status associated
with the old money of nobility
or royalty. Vou live a lifestyle comparable
to that of a
highly successful
merchant, a favored servant of the
royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses.
Vou
have respectable
lodgings, usually a spacious home in
a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn.
Vou likely have a small staff of servants.
Aristoeratie.
Vou live a life of plenty and comfort. Vou
move in circles populated by the most powerful people
in the community. Vou have excellent lodgings, perhaps
a townhouse
in the nicest part of town or rooms in the
finest inn. Vou dine at the best restaurants,
retain the
most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants
attending to your every need. Vou receive invitations
to the social gatherings
of the rich and powerful, and
spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild
leaders, high priests, and nobility. Vou must also
contend with the highest leveIs of deceit and treachery.
The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will
be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.
Wretehed.
Vou live in inhumane
conditions. With
no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can,
sneaking
into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying
on the goad graces of people better off than you. A
wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence,
disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other
wretched
people cavet your armor, weapons, and
adventuring
gear, which represent
a fortune by their
standards.
Vou are beneath the notice of most people.
SquaJid. Vou live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut
just outside town, or a vermin-infested
boarding house
in the worst part of town. Vou have shelter from the
elements, but you live in a desperate
and often vialent
environment,
in places rife with disease, hunger, and
misfortune.
Vou are beneath the notice of most people,
and you have few legal protections.
Most people at
this lifestyle levei have suffered some terrible setback.
They might be disturbed,
marked as exiles, or suffer
from disease.
Poor. A poor lifestyle means going without the
comforts available in a stable community. Simple food
and lodgings, threadbare
clothing, and unpredictable
conditions result in a sufficient, though probably
unpleasant,
experience.
Vour accommodations
might
be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above
a tavern. Vou benefit from some legal protections,
but you still have to contend with violence, crime,
and disease. People at this lifestyle levei tend to be
unskilled laborers, costermongers,
peddlers, thieves,
mercenaries,
and other disreputable
types.
Modest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums
and ensures
that you can maintain your equipment.
Vou live in an 01der part of town, renting a room in a
boarding house, inn, or temple. Vou don't go hungry or
thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple.
Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers
with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards,
and the like.
