CHAPTER
10: SPELLCASTING
AGIC
PERMEATES
THE WORLDS
OF D&D AND
most often appears in the form of a spell.
This chapter provides the rules for
casting spells. Different character
classes have distinctive ways of learning
and preparing
their spells, and monsters
use spells in unique ways. Regardless
of its source,
a spell follows the rules here.
WHAT 1s A SPELL?
A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping
of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse
into a specific, limited expression.
In casting a spell,
a character
carefully plucks at the invisible strands of
raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a
particular
pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way,
and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in
most cases, ali in the span of seconds.
Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective
wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or
remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy
away, and restore life to the dead.
Uncounted thousands
of spells have been created
over the course of the multiverse's
history, and many of
them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in
crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped
in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be
reinvented by a character
who has amassed
enough
power and wisdom to do sO.
SPELL LEVEL
Every spell has a levei from O to 9. A spell's levei is a
general indicator of how powerful it is. with the lowly
(but still impressive) magic missile at 1st levei and
the earth-shaking
wish at 9th. Cantrips-simple
but
powerful spells that characters
can cast almost by rote-
are levei O. The higher a spell's levei, the higher levei a
spellcaster
must be to use that spell.
Spelllevel
and character
levei don't correspond
directly. Typically, a character
has to be at least 17th
levei, not 9th levei, to cast a 9th-leveI spell.
KNOWN
AND PREPARED
SPELLS
Before a spellcaster
can use a spell, he or she must
have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access
to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes,
including bards and sorcerers,
have a limited list of
spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The
same thing is true of many magic-using monsters.
Other
spellcasters,
such as clerics and wizards, undergo a
process of preparing
spells. This process varies for
different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.

CASTING
IN ARMOR
Because
ofthe
mental
focus and precise gestures
required
for spellcasting,
you must be proncient
with the armor you
are wearing to cast a spell. Vou are otherwise too distracted
and physically hampered
by your armor
for spellcasting.

In every case, the number of spells a caster can
have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the
character's
leveI.
SPELL SLOTS
Regardless
of how many spells a caster knows or
prepares,
he or she can cast only a limited number of
spells before resting. Manipulating
the fabric of magic
and channeling
its energy into even a simple spell is
physically and mentally taxing, and higher-Ievel spells
are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting
class's
description
(except that of the warlock) includes a table
showing how many spell slots of each spelllevel
a
character
can use at each character
leveI. For example,
the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-levei spell slots
and two 2nd-levei slots.
When a character
casts a spell, he or she expends
a slot of that spell's levei or higher, effectively "filling"
a slot with the spell. Vou can think of a spell slot as a
groove of a certain size-small
for a 1st-levei slot,larger
for a spell of higher leveI. A 1st-levei spell fits into a slot
of any size, but a 9th-levei spell fits only in a 9th-levei
si01. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-levei
spell, she spends one of her four 1st-levei slots and has
three remaining.
Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots
(see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).
Some characters
and monsters have special abilities
that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For
example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four
Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch
invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can ali
cast spells in such a way.
CASTlNG
A SPELL AT A HIGHER
LEVEL
When a spellcaster
casts a spell using a slot that is of a
higher levei than the spell, the spell assumes
the higher
levei for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic
missile using one of her 2nd-levei slots, that magic
missile is 2nd leveI. Effectively, the spell expands to fill
the slot it is put into.
Some spells, sue h as magic missile and cure wounds,
have more powerful effects when cast at a higher levei,
as detailed in a spell's description.
CANTRIPS
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without
using a spell slot and without being prepared
in
advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the
caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic
needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's
spelllevel
is O.
RITUALS
Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell
ean be cast following the normal rules for spelleasting,
or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of
a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.
