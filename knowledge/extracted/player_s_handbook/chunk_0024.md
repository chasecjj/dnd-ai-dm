Artificer's Lore. Whenever you make an Intelligence
(History) check related to magic items, alchemical
objects, ar technological
devices, you can add twice your
proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you
normallyappIy.
Tinker. Vou have proficiency with artisan's
toois
(tinker's tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1
hour and 10 gp worth of materiaIs to construct
a Tiny
c1ockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases
to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour
repairing it to keep the device functioning), ar when
you use your action to dismantle
it; at that time, you can
reclaim the materiaIs used to create il. Vou can have up
to three such devices active at a time.
When you create a device, choose one of the
following options:
Clockwork
Toy. This toy is a c1ockwork animal, monster,
ar person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, ar
soldier. When placed on the grou nd, the toy moves
5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a
random direction. lt makes noises as appropriate
to the creature
it represents.
Fire Starter. The device produces a miniature
flame, which you can use to light a candle,
torch, ar campfire. Using the device
requires your action.
Music Sox. When opened, this music box
plays a single song at a moderate volume.
The box stops playing when it
reaches the song's end ar
when it is c1osed.
FOREST GNOME
As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for iIlusion
and inherent quickness
and stealth. In the worlds of
0&0, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather
in hidden communities
in sylvan forests, using iIlusions
and trickery to conceal themselves
from threats ar
to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest
gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited
woodland folk, and they regard elves and good feyas
their most important
allies. These gnomes also befriend
small forest animais and rely on them for information
about threats that might prowl their lands.

Natural I1lusionist. Vou know the minor illusion
cantrip. lntelligence is your spellcasting
ability for il.
Speak with Small Beasts. Through sounds and
gestures, you can communicate
simple ideas with Small
ar smaller beasts. Forest gnomes love animaIs and often
keep squirrels,
badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers,
and other creatures
as beloved pets.
ROCK GNOME
As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness
and
hardiness
beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes
in the worlds of 0&0 are rock gnomes, including the
tinker gnomes of the Oragonlance
setting.

ALWAYS
ApPRECIATIVE
It's rare for a gnome
to be hostile
ar malicious
unless
he
ar she has suffered
a grievous
injury. Gnomes
know that
most
races
don't
share
their
sense
of humor,
but they enjoy
anyone's
company
just as they enjoy everything
else they set
out to do.
