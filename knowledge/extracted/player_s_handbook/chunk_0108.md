URCHIN
Vou grew
up on the streets
alone,
orphaned,
and poor.
Vou had no one to watch
over you or to provide
for
you, so you learned
to provide
for yourself.
Vou fought
fiercely
over food and kept a constant
watch
out for other
desperate
souls
who might
steal
from you. Vou slept on
rooftops
and in alleyways,
exposed
to the elements,
and
endured
sickness
without
the advantage
of medicine
or
a place
to recuperate.
You've survived
despi te ali odds,
and did so through
cunning,
strength,
speed,
or some
combination
of each.
Vou begin your adventuring
career
with enough
money
to live modestly
but securely
for at least ten days.
How did you come
by that money?
What allowed
you to
break
free of your desperate
circumstances
and embark
on a better
life?
Skill
Proficiencies:
Sleight
of Hand,
Stealth
Tool Proficiencies:
Disguise
kit, thieves'
tools
Equiprnent:
A small
knife,
a map of the city you
grew up in, a pet mouse,
a token
to remember
your
parents
by, a set of common
clothes,
and a belt pouch
containing
10 gp
FEATURE:
CITY SECRETS
Vou know the secret
patterns
and flow to cities and can
find passages
through
the urban
sprawl
that others
would
miss. When you are not in combat,
you (and companions
you lead) can travei between
any two locations
in the city
twice as fast as your speed
would normally
allow.
SUGGESTED
CHARACTERISTICS
Urchins
are shaped
by lives of desperate
poverty,
for
good and for ill. They tend to be driven
either
by a
commitment
to the people
with whom
they shared
life
00 the street
or by a burning
desire
to find a better
life-
and maybe
get some
payback
on ali the rich people
who
treated
them
badly.
