ORIGINS
Different sorcerers
c1aim different origins for their
innate magic. Although many variations exist, most
of these origins fali into two categories: a draconic
bloodline and wild magic.
DRACONIC
BLOODLINE
Vour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was
mingled with your blood ar that of your ancestors.
Most
often, sorcerers
with this origin trace their descent
back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a
bargain with a dragon ar who might even have c1aimed
a dragon parenl. Some of these bloodlines are well
established
in the world, but most are obscure. Any
given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a
result of a pact ar some other exceptional circumstance.
DRAGON ANCESTOR
At 1st levei, you choose one type of dragon as your
ancestor. The damage type associated
with each dragon
is used by features you gain later.

Vou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally,
whenever you make a Charisma
check when interacting
with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it
applies to the check.
DRACONIC
RESILIENCE
As magic f10ws through your body, it causes physical
traits of your dragon ancestors
to emerge. At 1st levei,
your hit point maximum increases
by 1 and increases
by
1 again whenever you gain a levei in this c1ass.
Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin
sheen of dragon-Iike scales. When you aren't wearing
armar, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
ELEM ENTAL AFFIN ITY
Starting
at 6th levei, when you cast a spell thal deals
damage of the type associated
with your draconic
ancestry, add your Charisma
modifier to that damage.
At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain
resistance
to that damage type for 1 hour.
