Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Animal

Religion, and Survival
EQUIPMENT
Vou start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:
(a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon
(a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon
Leather armor, an explorer's pack, and a druidic focus
DRUIDIC
Vou know Druidic, the secret language of druids. Vou
can speak the language and use it to leave hidden
messages.
Vou and others who know this language
automatically
spot such a message. Others spot lhe
message's
presence with a successful
DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception)
check but can't decipher it without magic.
SPELLCASTING
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you
can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See
chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting
and
chapter 11 for the druid spell list.
CANTRIPS
At 1st levei, you know two cantrips of your choice from
the druid spelllist.
Vou learn additional druid cantrips
of your choice at higher leveis, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Druid table.
one spell). The spells must be of a levei for which you
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-Ievel druid, you have four
1st-levei and two 2nd-levei spell slots, With a Wisdom
of 16, your list of prepared
spells can include six spells
of 1st ar 2nd levei, in any combination.
If you prepare
the lst.level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-levei ar 2nd-levei slot. Casting the spell doesn't
remove it from your list of prepared
spells,
Vou can also change your list of prepared
spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing
a new list of druid
spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at
least 1 minute per spelllevel
for each spell on your list.
SPELLCASTING
ABILITY
Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your druid
spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and
attunement
to nature. Vou use your Wisdom whenever
a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. [n addition,
you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
Spellsave DC~ 8 + your profícíencybonus +
your Wisdom modifier
Spellattack modifier~ your proficiencybonus +
yourWisdom modifier
RITUAL
CASTING
Vou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

SACREO PLANTS ANO WOOO
Adruid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularlyalder,
ash, birch,elder, hazel,holly,juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan,
willow,and yew.Druidsoften use such plants as part of a
spellcastíngfocus, incorporatinglengths of oak or yewor
sprigs of mistletoe.
Similarly,a druid uses such woods to make other objects,
such as weapons and shields.Yewis assocíated wíthdeath
and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sicklesmight
be fashioned from il.Ash is assocíated with lifeand oak
with strength. These woods make excellenthafts or whole
weapons, such as c1ubsor quarterstaffs, as wellas shields.
Alderis assocíated wíth air,and it might be used forthrown
weapons,
such as darts
or javelins.
Druidsfrom regions that lackthe plants described here
have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For
instance, a druid of a desert region might valuethe yucca
tree and cactus plants.
