FEATS
A feat represents
a talent or an area of expertise that gives
a character special capabilities. lt embodies training,
experience, and abitities beyond what a c1ass provides.
At certain leveIs, your c1ass gives you the Ability Score
Improvement
feature. Using the optional feats rule, you
can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice
instead. Vou can take each feat only once, unless the
feat's description
says otherwise.
Vou must meet any prerequisite
specified in a feat
to take that feat. Ifyou ever lose a feat's prerequisite,
you can't use lhat feat until you regain the prerequisite.
For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a
Strength
of 13 or higher. If your Strength
is reduced
below 13 somehow-perhaps
by a withering curse-
you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your
Strength
is restored.
ALERT
Always on the lookout for danger, you gain the
following benefits:
Vou gain a +5 bonus to initiative.
Vou can't be surprised
while you are conscious.
Other creatures
don't gain advantage on attack rolls
against you as a result of being hidden from you.
ATHLETE
Vou have undergone extensive physical training to gain
the following benefits:
Increase your Strength
or Dexterity score by 1, to a
maximum of 20.
When you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of
you r movement.
Climbing doesn't halve your speed.
Vou can make a running long jump or a running high
jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than
10 feet.
ACTOR
Skilled at mimicry and dramatics,
you gain the
following benefits:
Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Vou have advantage on Charisma
(Deception) and
Charisma
(Performance)
checks when trying to pass
yourself off as a different person.
Vou can mimic the speech of another person or the
sounds made by other creatures.
Vou must have
heard the person speaking. or heard the creature
make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful
Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma
(Deception) check allows a tistener to determine
that
the effect is faked.
CHARGER
When you use your action to Dash, you can use a
bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to
shove a creature.
1fyou move at least 10 feet in a straight tine
immediately before taking this bonus action, you either
gain a +5 bonus to the attack's damage roll (if you chose
to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up
to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and
you succeed).
CROSSBOW
EXPERT
Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you
gain the following benefits:
Vou ignore the loading quality of crossbows
with
which you are proficient.
Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature
doesn't
impose disadvantage
on your ranged attack rolls.
When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-
handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack
with a loaded hand crossbow you are holding.
DEFENSIVE
DUELIST
Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher
When you are wielding a finesse weapon with which
you are proficient and another creature
hits you with
a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your
proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially
causing the attack to miss you.
DUAL
WIELDER
Vou master fighting with two weapons, gaining the
following benefits:
Vou gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding a
separate
melee weapon in each hand.
Vou can use two-weapon fighting even whcn the one-
handed melee weapons you are wielding aren't light.
Vou can draw or stow two one-handed
weapons when
you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
