weapons
(a) fivejavelins or (b) any sim pIe melee weapon
(a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
Chain mail and a holy symbol
DIVINE
SENSE
The presence
of strong evil registers on your senses like
a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly
music in your ears. As an action, you can open your
awareness
to detect such forces. Until the end of your
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend,
or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total
cover. Vou know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of
any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity
(the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).
Within the same radius, you also detect the presence
of any place or object that has been consecrated
or
desecrated,
as with the hallow spell.
Vou can use this feature a number of times equal to
1 + your Charisma
modifier. When you finish a long rest,
you regain ali expended uses.
LAY ON HANDS
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. Vou have a pool
of healing power that replenishes
when you take a long
rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of
hit points equal to your paladin leveI x 5.
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw
power from the pool to restore a number of hit points
to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining
in your pool.
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your
pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or
neutralize
one poison affecting it. Vou can cure multi pIe
diseases
and neutralize
multi pIe poisons with a single
use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately
for each one.
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
PART
1 I CLASSES
FIGHTING
STYLE
At 2nd leveI, you adopt a style of fighting as your
specialty. Choose one of the following options. Vou can't
take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.
DEFENSE
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
DUELING
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and
no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
with that weapon.
GREAT WEAPON
FIGHTING
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll. The weapon must have the two-handed
or versatile
property for you to gain this benefit.
PROTECTION
When a creature you can see attacks a target other
than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your
reaction to impose disadvantage
on the attack roll.
Vou must be wielding a shield.
SPELLCASTING
By 2nd levei, you have learned to draw on divine
magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as
a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting
and chapter 11 for the paladin spell listo
PREPARING
AND CASTING
SPELLS
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of
1st leveI or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's
leveI or higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when
you finish a long resto
Vou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spelllist.
When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells
equal to your Charisma
modifier + half your paladin
leveI, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells
must be of a leveI for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-leveI paladin, you have
four 1st-leveI and two 2nd-leveI spell slots. With a
Charisma
of 14, your list of prepared
spells can include
four spells of 1st or 2nd levei, in any combination.
If you
prepare the 1st-levei spell cure wounds, you can cast
it using a 1st-leveI or a 2nd-leveI slot. Casting the spell
doesn't remove it from your list of prepared
spells.
Vou can change your list of prepared
spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing
a new list of paladin spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least I
minute per spelllevel
for each spell on your list.
