6th./evel necromancy
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components:
V,S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some
other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)
Duration: Until dispelled
Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soulleaves
it and enters the container you used for the spell's
material component. While your soul inhabits the
container, you are aware of your surroundings as ifyou
were in the container's space. Voucan't move or use
reactions. The only action you can take is to project your
soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning
to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting
to possess a humanoids body.
Voucan attempt to possess any humanoid within
100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a
protection [rom evil and good or magic circIe spell can't
be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving
throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's
body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the
container. On a success, the target resists your efforts
to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again
for 24 hours.
Once you possess a creature's body, you control it.
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the
creature, though you retain your alignment and your
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Vou retain
the benefit of your own class features. Ir the target has
any class leveis, you can't use any of its class features.
Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can
perceive from the container using its own senses, but it
can't move or take actions at ali.
While possessing a body, you can use your action to
return from the host body to the container if it is within
100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to
its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the
creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving
throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success,
you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you.
Otherwise, you die.
If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your
soul immediately returns to your body. Ifyour body is
more than 100 feet away from you or ifyour body is
dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. Ir another
creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed,
the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive
and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

Vou implant a message within an object in range, a
message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met.
Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being
worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the
message, which must be 25 words or less, though it
can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally,
determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to
deliver your message.
When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth
appears on the object and recites the message in your
voice and at the same volume you spoke. Ir the object
you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a
mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical
mouth appears there so that the words appear to come
from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you
can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or
it can remain and repeat its message whenever the
trigger occurs.
The triggering circumstance can be as general or as
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual
or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the
object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to
speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the
object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.
