The reincarnated
creature
recalls its former life
and experiences.
It retains the capabilities
it had in its
original form, except it exchanges
its original race for
the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.
Vou touch a creature
and stimulate its natural healing
ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the
duration of the spell, the target regains I hit point at the
start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).
The target's severed body members (fingers, legs,
tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes.
If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump,
the spell instantaneously
causes the limb to knit
to the stump.

Vou touch a dead humanoid ar a piece of a dead
humanoid. Provided that the creature
has been dead no
longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body
for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the
target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.
The magic fashions a new body for the creature
to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's
race to
change. The DM rolls a dlOO and consults the following
table to determine
what form the creature
takes when
restored to life, ar the DM chooses a formo
