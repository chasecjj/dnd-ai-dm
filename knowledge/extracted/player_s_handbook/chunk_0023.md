GNOME
SKINNY
AND FLAXEN-HAIRED,
HIS SKIN
walnut brown and his eyes a startling
turquoise. Burgell stood half as tall asAeron an
ad to
climb up on a stool to look out the peephole. Like most hab-
itations in Oeble. that particular tenement had been built
for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting
awkwardness as best they could.
But at least the relative largeness ofthe apartment gave
Burgell room to pack in ali his gnome-sized gear. Thefront
room was his workshop. and it contained a bewildering
miscellany of tools: hammers. chisels. saws. lockpicks,
tinted lenses.jeweler's loupes. andjars of powdered and
shredded ingredients for casting spells. Afat gray cat. the
mage'sfamiliar, lay curled atop a grimoire. Tt opened its
eyes. gave Aeron a disdainjulyellow stare. then appeared
to go back to sleep.
-Richard
Lee Byers, The Black Bouquet
A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens
and neighborhoods
where gnomes form their close-
knit communities.
Louder sounds punctuate
the hum:
a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion
there, a yelp of surprise
or triumph, and especially
bursts of laughter. Gnomes take de!ight in !ife, enjoying
every moment of invention, exploration, investigation,
creation, and play.
VIBRANT
EXPRESSION
A gnome's energy and enthusiasm
for living shines
through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes
average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45
pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned
with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses),
and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their
fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction,
as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in
everything around.
A gnome's persona!ity is writ large in his or ber
appearance.
A male gnome's beard, in contrast to
his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often
styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's
clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones,
is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing,
or gleaming jewels.
DELIGHTED
DEDICATION
As far as gnomes are concerned,
being a!ive is a
wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of
enjoyment out of their three to tive centuries
of !ife.
Humans might wonder about getting bored over the
course of such a long tife, and elves take plenty of time
to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but
gnomes seem to worry that even with ali that time, they
can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see.
Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts
out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer
ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still
manage to listen carefully to others, adding the
appropriate
exclamations
of surprise
and appreciation
along the way.

Though gnomes love jokes of ali kinds, particularly
puns and pranks, they're just as dedicaled lo lhe more
serious tasks they undertake,
Many gnomes are skilled
engineers,

willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves

foolhardy) risks and dreaming

BURROWS
Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They
live underground
but get more fresh air than dwarves
do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface
whenever lhey can, Their homes are well hidden by
bolh elever conslruclion
and simple illusions, Welcome
visitors are quickly ushered inlo lhe bright, warm
burrows, Those who are not welcome are unlikely to
find the burrows in lhe first place,
Gnomes who setlle in human lands are commonly
gemcutlers,
engineers,
sages, or tinkers. Some human
families relain gnome lutors, ensuring lhat their pupils
enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment.

GNOME NAMES
Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so.
A gnome's mother, falher, elan elder, aunts, and uneles
each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames
from juSl about everyone else might or might not stick
over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the
names of ancestors
or distant relalives, lhough some
are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans
and others who are "stuffy" aboul names, a gnome
learns to use no more than three names: a personal
name, a elan na me, and a nickname, choosing lhe one in
each calegory that's the most fun to say.

DEEP
GNOMES
A third
subrace
of gnomes,
the deep
gnomes
(or svirfneblin),
live in small
communities
scattered
in the Underdark.
Unlike
the duergar
and the drow, svirfneblin
are as good
as their
surface cousins. However, their humor and enthusiasm
are dampened
by their oppressive
environment,
and their
inventive
expertise
is directed
mostly
toward
stonework.

SEEING THE WORLD
Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up
adventuring
as a way to see the world ar for lhe lave
of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine ilems,
some gnomes take to adventuring
as a quick, if
dangerous,
path to wealth. Regardless

them lo adventure, gnomes who adopt this way of life
eke as much enjoymenl out of it as they do oul of any
other activity they undertake,
