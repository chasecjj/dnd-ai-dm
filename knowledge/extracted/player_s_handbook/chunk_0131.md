ATTACK
ROLLS AND DAMAGE
Vou add your Strength
modifier to your attack roll and
your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon
such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. Vou use
melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand
combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a
ranged attack.
LIFTING
AND CARRYING
Vour Strength
score determines
the amount ofweight
you can bear. The following terms define what you can
lift or carry.
Carrying Capacity. Vour carrying capacity is your
Strength
score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in
pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that
most characlers
don't usually have to worry about it.
Push, Drag, ar Lirt. Vou can push, drag, or lift a
weighl in pounds up to lwice your carrying capacity
(or 30 times your Slrength
score). While pushing or
dragging wcight in excess ofyour carrying capacity,
your speed drops lo 5 fee!.
Size and Strength.
Larger crealures
can bear more
weighl, whereas Tiny creatures
can carry less. For
each size calegory above Medium, double lhe creature's
carrying capacity and lhe amount il can push, drag, or
lif!. For a Tiny creature,
halve lhese weighls.

VARIANT:
ENCUMBRANCE
The rules for lifling and carrying are inlentionally
simple. Here is a variant ifyou are looking for more
detailed rules for delermining
how a characler
is
hindered by the weighl of equipmen!. When you use this
varianl, ignore lhe Strength
column of the Armor table
in chapter 5.
If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength
score, you are encumbered,
which means your speed
drops by 10 fee!.
If you carry weighl in excess of 10 times your
Slrenglh
score, up to your maximum carrying capacity,
you are instead heavily encumbered,
which means your
speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvanlage
on
ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use
Strength,
Dexterity, or Constitution.
DEXTERITY
Dexterily measures
agility, reflexes, and balance.
DEXTERITY
CHECKS
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move
nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling
on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand,
and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of
Dexterity checks.
Acrobatics.
Vour Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers
your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation,
such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice,
balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking
ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic
stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults,
and flips.


--- Page 178 ---

Sleight af Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of
legerdemain
or manual triekery, such as planting
something
on someone else or concealing an object on
yaur person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
check to determine
whether you can lift a coin purse off
another person or slip something
out of another
person's pocket.
SteaJth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you
attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past
guards, slip away without being notieed, or sneak up on
someone without being seen or heard.
Other Dexterity Checks. The DM might call for a
Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like
the following:
Control a heavily Jaden cart on a steep descent
Steer a chariot around a tight turo
Pick a lock
Disable a trap
Securely tie up a prisoner
Wriggle free of bonds
Playa stringed instrument
Craft a small or detailed object
ATTACK ROLLS AND DAMAGE
Vou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and
your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon,
such as a sling or a longbow. Vou can also add your
Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage
roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the
finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

HIDING
When
you try to hide,
make
a Dexterity
(Stealth)
check.
Until
you are discovered
or you stop
hiding,
that
check's
total
is
contested
by the Wisdom
(Perception)
check
of any creature
that
actively
searches
for signs
of your presence.
You can't
hide from a creature
that can see you. and if you
make
noise
(such
as shouting
a warning
or knocking
over a
vase),
you give away your position.
An invisible
creature
can't
be seen,
50 it can always try to hide.
Signs
of its passage
might
still be noticed,
however,
and it still has to stay quiet.
In combat,
most
creatures
stay alert for signs
of danger
ali around,
50 if you come
out of hiding
and approach
a creature,
it usually
sees
you. However,
under
certain
circumstances,
the Dungeon
Master
might
allow you to stay
hidden
as you approach
a creature
that
is distracted,
allowing
you to gain advantage
on an attack
before
you are seen.
Passive Pereeptian.
When
you hide, there's
a chance
someone
will notice
you even
if they aren't
searching.
To
determine
whether
such
a creature
notices
you, the DM
compares
your Dexterity
(Stealth)
check with that creature's
passive
Wisdom
(Perception)
score,
which
equals
10 + the
creature's
Wisdom
modifier,
as well as any other
bonuses
or penalties.
Ifthe
creature
has advantage,
add 5. For
disadvantage,
subtract
5.
For example,
if a lst.level
character
(with a proficiency
bonus
of +2) has a Wisdom
of 15 (a +2 modifier)
and
proficiency
in Perception,
he or she has a passive
Wisdom
(Perception)
of 14.
What Can You See? One of the main
factors
in determining
whether
you can find a hidden
creature
or object
is how well
you can see in an area, which
might
be lightly or heavily
obscured,
as explained
in chapter
8.

ARMOR CLASS
Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some
or alI of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class,
as described
in chapter 5.
INITlATIVE
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative
by making a Dexterity check. lnitiative determines
the order of creatures'
turos in combat, as described
in chapter 9.
CONSTITUTION
Constitution
measures
health, stamina, and vital force.
CONSTlTUTlON
CHECKS
Constitution
checks are uncommon, and no skills apply
to Constitution
checks, because the endurance
this
ability represents
is largely passive rather than involving
a specific effort on the part of a character
or monster.
A Constitution
check can model your attempt to push
beyond normallimits,
however.
The DM might call for a Constitution
check when you
try to accomplish
tasks like the following:
Hold your breath
March or labor for hours without rest
Go without sleep
Survive without food or water
Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go
HIT
POINTS
Your Constitution
modifier contributes
to your hit
points. Typieally, you add your Constitution
modifier to
each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.
Ifyour Constitution
modifier changes, your hit point
maximum changes as well, as though you had the new
modifier from 1st leveI. For example, if Yotlraise your
Constittltion score when you reach 4th levei and your
Constitution
modifier increases
from +1 to +2, you
adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier
had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your
first three leveis, and then roll your hit points for 4th
levei using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th levei and
some effect lowers your Constitution
score so as to
reduce your Constitution
modifier by 1,Yotlr hit point
maximum is reduced by 7.
INTELLIGENCE
lntelligence measures
mental acuity. accuracy of recall,
and the ability to reason.
INTELLIGENCE
CHECKS
An lntelligence check comes into play when you need
to draw on logie, education, memory, or deductive
reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature,
and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of
lntelligence checks.
Arcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures
your ability to recalllore
about spells, magie items,
e1dritch symbols, magical traditions,
the planes of
existence, and the inhabitants
of those planes.
History. Your Intelligence (History) check measures
your ability to recalllore
about historieal events,
