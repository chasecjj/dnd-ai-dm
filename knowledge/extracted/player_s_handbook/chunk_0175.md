either a creature ar an object that is neither worn
nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a
Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell
has no effect.
If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and
carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped byan
affected creature returns to normal size at once.
Enlarge. The target's size doubles in ali dimensions,
and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth
increases its size by one category-from
Medium to
Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the
target to double its size. the creature or object attains
the maximum possible size in the space available.

these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with
them deal ld4 extra damage.

The target's size is halved in ali dimensions,
and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This
reduction decreases its size by one category-from

the target also has disadvantage on 5trength checks
and 5trength saving throws. The target's weapons also
shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are
reduced, the target's attacks with them deal ld4 less
