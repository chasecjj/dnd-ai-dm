NATURE DOMAIN
Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world
itself, from illscrutable gods of the deep forests (such
as Silva nus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to
friendly deities associated
with particular
springs and
groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a
whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing
mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgolten prayers in
their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have
c1erics as well, champions who take a more active role
in advancing the interests of a particular
nature god.
These c1erics might hunt the evil monstrosities
that
despoil the woodlands,
bless the harvest of the faithful,
or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.
