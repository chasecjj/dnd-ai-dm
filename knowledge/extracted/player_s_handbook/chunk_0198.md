PHANTASMAL
FORCE
2nd-levei i11usion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components:
V.S. M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration. up to I minute
Voucraft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a
creature that you can see within range. The target must
make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you
create a phantasmal object, creature. or other visible
phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a
lO-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target
for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead
ar constructs.
The phantasm includes sound, temperature. and other
stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes
that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats
the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes
any illogical outcomes from interacting with the
phantasm. For example. a target attempting to walk
across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls
once it steps anta the bridge. ]f the target survives the
fali, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up
with some other explanation for its fall-it was pushed,
it slipped, ar a strong wind might have knocked it off.
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's
reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A
phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the
target. Similarly. a phantasm created to appear as tire. a
pool of acid. ar lava can burn the target. Each round on
your turn. the phantasm can deal Id6 psychic damage
to the target if it is in the phantasm's area ar within 5
feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a
creature ar hazard that could logically deal damage.
such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage
as a type appropriate to the illusion.
