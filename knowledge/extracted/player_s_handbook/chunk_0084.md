ARCANE
RECOVERY
Vou have learned to regain some of your magical energy
by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you
finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots
to recover. The spell slots can have a combined leveI that
is equal to or less than half your wizard leveI (rounded
up), and none of the slots can be 6th leveI or higher.
For example, ifyou're a 4th-leveI wizard, you can recover
up to two leveIs worth of spell slots. Voucan recover either
a 2nd-leveI spell slot or two 1st-levei spell slots.
ARCANE
TRADITION
When you reach 2nd levei, you choose an arcane
tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one
of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration,
Oivination,
Enchantment,
Evocation, lllusion, Necromancy,
or Transmutation,
ali detailed at the end of the
class description.
Your choice grants you features at 2nd leveI and again
at 6th, 10th, and 14th leveI.
ABILITY
SCORE IMPROVEMENT
When you reach 4th levei, and again at 8th, 12th. 16th,
and 19th leveI, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1.As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
SPELL MASTERY
At 18th leveI, you have achieved such mastery over
certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a
1st-levei wizard spell and a 2nd.level wizard spell that
are in your spellbook. Vou can cast those spells at their
lowest leveI without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared.
1£you want to cast either spell at a
higher leveI, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one
or both of the spells you chose for different spells of
the same leveIs.
SIGNATURE
SPELLS
When you reach 20th levei, you gain mastery over two
powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.
Choose two 3rd.level wizard spells in your spellbook
as your signature spells. Vou always have these spells
prepared, they don't count against the number of spells
you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at
3rd leveI without expending a spell slot. When you do so,
you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
1£you want to cast either spell at a higher leveI, you
must expend a spell slot as normal.
ARCANE TRADITIONS
The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching
back to
the earliest mortal discoveries
of magic. It is firmly
established
in the worlds of 0&0, with various
traditions dedicated to its complex study.
The most common arcane traditions
in the multiverse
revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through
the ages have cataloged thousands
of spells, grouping
them into eight categories called schools, as described
in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are
literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of
lllusion while another studies across town at the School
of Enchantment.
In other institutions,
the schools are
more like academic departments,
with rival faculties
competing for students and funding. Even wizards who
train apprentices
in the solitude of their own towers use
the division of magic into schools as a learning device,
since the spells of each school require mastery of
different techniques.
SCHOOL
OF ABJURATION
The School of Abjuration emphasizes
magic that blocks,
banishes, or protects. Oetractors
of this school say
that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than
positive assertion.
Vou understand,
however, that ending
harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing
evil
influences is anything but a philosophical
void. It is a
proud and respected vocation.
Called abjurers, members of this school are sought
when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important
locations must be guarded against magical spying, and
when portaIs to other planes of existence must be closed.
ABJURATION
SAVANT
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd leveI, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration
spell into your spellbook is halved.
ARCANE
WARD
Starting at 2nd levei, you can weave magic around
yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration
spell of Ist leveI or higher, you can simultaneously
use a
strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on
yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward
has hit points equal to twice your wizard leveI + your
Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the
ward takes the damage instead. lf this damage reduces
the ward to O hit points, you take any remaining damage.
While the ward has O hit points, it can't absorb
damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an
abjuration spell of 1st leveI or higher, the ward regains a
number of hit points equal to twice the leveI of the spell.
Once you create the ward, you can't create it again
until you finish a long resto
PROJECTED WARD
Starting
at 6th leveI. when a creature
that you can see
within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your
reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that
damage. If this damage reduces the ward to O hit points,
the warded creature
takes any remaining
damage.
IMPROVED
ABJURATION
Beginning at 10th leveI, when you cast an abjuration
spell that requires you to make an ability check as
a part of casting that spell (as in counterspell and
dispel magic),you add your proficiency bonus to lhat
ability check.
