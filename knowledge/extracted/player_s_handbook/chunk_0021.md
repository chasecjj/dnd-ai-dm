DRAGONBORN
HER FATHER STOOD
ON THE FIRST OF THE THREE
STAIRS
that led dawnfrom
the parta I, unmoving.
The scales of his
face had grown paler around the edges, but Clanless Mehen
stil/ looked as if he could wrestle down a dire bear him-
seif. Hisfamiliar
wel/-worn
armor was gone, replaced by
violet-tinted
scale armor with bright silvery tracings. There
was a blazon on his arm as wel/, the mark of someforeign
house. The sword at his back was the same, though, the one
he had carried since even before he hadfound
the twins left
in swaddling
at the gates of Arush Vayem.
PART 1 I RACES
For al/ her life, Farideh had known that reading her
father'sface
was a skill she'd beenfortunate
to learn. A
human
who couldn't spot the shift of her eyes or Havilar's
would certain(y see on(y the indifference
of a dragon in
Clanless Mehen'sface.
But the shift of scales, the arch of a
ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth-her
father's
face spoke volumes.
But every scale of it, this time, seemed complete(y stil/-
the indifference
of a dragon, even to Farideh.
-Erin
M. Evans, TheAdversary
Born of dragons, as their na me proclaims, the
dragonborn
walk proudly through a world that greets
them with fearful incomprehension.
Shaped by draconic
gods OI' the dragons themselves,
dragonborn
originally
hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining
the best attributes
of dragons and humanoids.
Some
dragonborn
are faithful servants to true dragons, others
form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others
find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
PROUD DRAGON
KIN
Dragonborn
look very much like dragons standing erect
in humanoid form, though they lack wings or atai!. The
first dragonborn
had scales of vibrant hues matching
the colors of their dragon kin, but generations
of
interbreeding
have created a more uniform appearance.
Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze
in colar, sometimes
ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, ar
copper-green.
They are tall and strongly built, often
standing close to 6'h feet tall and weighing 300 pounds
ar more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike
claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.
The blood of a particular
type of dragon runs
very strong through some dragonborn
clans. These
dragonborn
often boast scales that more closely match
those of their dragon ancestor-bright
red, green, blue,
or white, lustrous black, ar gleaming metallic gold,
silver, brass, copper, or bronze.

SELF-SUFFICIENT
CLANS
To any dragonborn.
the dan
is more
important
than
life itself. Dragonborn
owe their
devotion
and respect
to their dan
above ali e1se, even the gods.
Each
dragonborn's
conduct
reflects
on the honor
of his or her
dan,
and bringing
dishonor
to the dan
can result
in
expulsion
and exile. Each
dragonborn
knows
his or her
station
and duties
within
the dan,
and honor
demands
maintaining
the bounds
of that position.
A continuaI
drive for self-improvement
reflects
the
self-sufficiency
of the race as a whole.
Dragonborn
value
skill and excellence
in ali endeavors.
They hate to fai!.
and they push
themselves
to extreme
efforts
before
they
give up on something.
A dragonborn
holds
mastery
of
a particular
skill as a lifetime
goal. Members
of other
races
who share
the same
commitment
find it easy to
earn
the respect
of a dragonborn.
Though
ali dragonborn
strive
to be self-sufficient,
they recognize
that help is sometimes
needed
in difficult
situations.
But the best source
for such heJp is the
dan,
and when
a dan
needs
help. it turns
to another
dragonborn
dan
before
seeking
aid from other
races-
or even fram
the gods.
DRAGONBORN

have personal
names

UNCOMMON
RACES
lhe dragonborn
and the rest ofthe raees in this ehapter are
uneommon.
lhey don't exist in every worid of D&D, and
even where they are found. they are less widespread than
dwarves. elves. halAings. and humans.
In the cosmopolitan
eities ofthe
D&D multiverse, most
peopie hardly look twiee at members of even the most
exotie raees. But the small towns and villages that dot
the countryside are different. lhe common folk aren't
accustomed
to seeing members ofthese
races, and they
reaet accordingly.
Dragonborn. Irs easy to assume that a dragonborn
is a
monster, especially ifhis or her scaies betray a ehromatic
heritage. Unless the dragonborn
starts breathing fire and
causing destruction.
though, peopie are likelyto respond
with eaution rather than outright fear.
Gnome. Gnomes don't look like a threat and ean quickly
disarm suspieion with good humor. lhe eommon folk are
often eurious about gnomes, likely never having seen one
before. but they are rarely hostile or fearful.
HalfEIf.
Although many people have never seen a haif-elf.
virtually everyone knows they exist. A half.elf stranger's
arrival is followed by gossip behind the half.elf's baek and
stoien glanees aeross the eommon
room, rather than any
confrontation ar open curiosity.
HalfOrc.
Irs usually safe to assume that a half.ore is
belligerent and quiek to anger, so peopie wateh themselves
around an unfamiliar half-ore. Shopkeepers
might
surreptitiously
hide valuable or fragile goods when a haif-ore
comes in. and peopie slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a
fight will break out soon.
riefling. Haif.ores are greeted with a praetieal caution, but
tieAings are the subjeet of supernatural
fear. lhe evil of their
heritage is plainly visibie in their features. and as far as most
people are eoneerned,
a tieAing eould very well be a devil
straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding
signs as a tieAing approaehes,
eross the street to avoid
passing near, or bar shop doors before a tieAing ean enter.
