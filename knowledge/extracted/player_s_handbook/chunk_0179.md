You sense the presenee of any trap within range that
is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this
spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or
unexpeeted
effeet you eonsider harmful or undesirable,
which was speeilieally intended as sueh by its ereator.
Thus, the spell would sense an area affeeted by the
alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a meehanieal
pit trap,
but it would not reveal a natural weakness
in the floor,
an unstable eeiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You
don't learo the loeation of eaeh trap, but you do learo the
general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
