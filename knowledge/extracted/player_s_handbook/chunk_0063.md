RANGER
Rough and wild looking,
a human stalks alone
thraugh the shadows of
trees, hunting the orcs he
knows are planning a raid
on a nearby farm, Clutching
a shortsword
in each hand,
he becomes a whirlwind of
steel, cutting down one enemy
after another.
After tumbling away from a cone of
freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws
back her bow to loose an arrow aI the white
dragon. Shrugging
off the wave of fear that emanates
from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends
one arrow after another to find the gaps between the
dragon's thick scales.
Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk
that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his
side. Whispering
instructions
in Elvish, he points to
the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to
distract the creature while he readies his bow.
Far fram the bustle of cities and towns, past the
hedges lhat shelter the most distant farms fram the
terrors of the wild, amid lhe dense-packed
trees of
trackJess forests and across wide and empty plains,
rangers keep their unending watch.
DEADLY HUNTERS
Warriors of the wilderness,
rangers specialize in
hunting the monsters that threaten
the edges of
civilization-humanoid
raiders, rampaging
beasts and
monstrasities,
terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They
learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving
stealthily thraugh the wilds and hiding lhemselves in
brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training
on techniques
that are particularly
useful against their
specific favored foes.
Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers
acquire the ability to cast spells that harness
nature's
power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their
combat abilities, emphasize
speed, stealth, and the hunt.
A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly
focus on the grim task of protecting lhe borderlands.
INDEPENDENT
ADVENTURERS
Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a
guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend
the outskirts of civilization fram lhe ravages of monsters
and humanoid hordes lhat press in from the wild. In
some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join
forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are
independent
almost to a fault, knowing that, when a
dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be lhe
first-and
possibly the last-line
of defense.
This fierce independence
makes rangers well suited
to adventuring,
since they are accustomed
to life far
fram the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced
with city-bred adventurers
who grouse and whine about
the hardships
of the wild, rangers respond with some

What made you join up with a band of adventurers?
Do you find it challenging
to teach new allies the ways
of the wild, or do you welcome lhe relief from solitude
that they offer?

mixture of amusement,

But they quickly learn that other adventurers
who can
carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's
foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might
not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in
the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.
CREATING
A RANGER
As a ranger, you gain the following class features.
As you create your ranger character, consider the nature
of the training that gave you your particular
capabilities.
Did you train with a single mentor, wandering
lhe wilds
together until you mastered
the ranger's ways? Did you
leave your apprenticeship,
or was your mentor slain-
perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your
favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as
part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle,
trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness
lore. Vou
might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat
skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature
through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.
What's the source of your particular
hatred of a
certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone
you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see
toa much of lhe destruction
these monsters cause and
commit yourself to reining in their depredations?
[s
your adventuring
career a continuation
of your work
in protecting the borderlands,
or a significant change?
