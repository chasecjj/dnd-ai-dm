CHAPTER 7: USINGABILITY
SCORES
)
IX ABILlTIES
PROVIDE
A QUICK
DESCRIPTION
of every creature's
physical and mental
characteristics:
Strength,
measuring
physical power
. Dexterity,
measuring
agility
• Constitution,
measuring
endurance
Intelligence,
measuring
reasoning
and memory
Wisdom, measuring
perception and insight
Charisma,
measuring
force of personality
Is a character
muscle-bound
and insightful? Brilliant
and charming?
Nimble and hardy? Ability scores
define these qualities-a
creature's
assets as well
as weaknesses.
The three main rolls of the game-the
ability check,
the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely
on the six
ability scores. The book's introduction
describes
the
basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability
modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
compare the total to a target number.
This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks
and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities
that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls
appear in chapter 9.
ABILITY
SCORES AND
MODIFIERS
Each of a creature's
abilities has a score. a number that
defines the magnitude
of that ability. An ability score
is not just a measure
of innate capabilities,
but also
encompasses
a creature's
training and competence
in
activities related to that ability.
A score of 10 or II is the normal human average, but
adventurers
and many monsters are a cut above average
in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a
person usually reaches. Adventurers
can have scores
as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have
scores as high as 30.
Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the
score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of I) to
+10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers
table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible
ability scores, from 1 to 30.

To determine
an ability modifier without consulting
the table, subtract
10 from the ability score and then
divide the total by 2 (round down).
Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack
roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers
come up in play more often than their associated
scores .
ADVANTAGE AND
DISADVANTAGE
Sometimes
a special ability or spell tells you that you
have advantage or disadvantage
on an ability check,
a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens,
you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the
higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use
the lower roll if you have disadvantage.
For example, if
you have disadvantage
and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the
5. ]f you instead have advantage and roll those numbers,
you use the 17.
]f multi pie situations affect a roll and each one grants
advantage or imposes disadvantage
on it, you don't roll
more than one additional d20. Jf two favorable situations
grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one
additional d20.
If circumstances
cause a roll to have both advantage
and disadvantage,
you are considered
to have neither of
them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multi pie
circumstances
impose disadvantage
and only one grants
advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have
neither advantage nor disadvantage.
When you have advantage or disadvantage
and
something
in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky
trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one
of the dice. Vou choose which one. For example, if a
halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls
a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to
reroll the I.
Vou usually gain advantage or disadvantage
through
the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration
(see chapter 4) can also give a characler
advantage on
checks related to the character's
personality, ideais,
or bonds. The DM can also decide that circumstances
influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant
advantage or impose disadvantage
as a result.
PROFICIENCY
BONUS
Characters
have a proficiency bonus determined
by
levei, as detailed in chapter I. Monsters also have this
bonus, which is incorporated
in their stat blocks. The
bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving
throws, and attack rolls.
Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die
roll or other number more than once. For example, if
two different rules say you can add your proficiency
bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless
add
the bonus only once when you make the savc.
Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be
multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example)
