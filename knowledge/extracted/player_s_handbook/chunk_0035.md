CLERIC
Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer
on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that
spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.
Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe
in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs
arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with
every foe's falI.
Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a
human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to
drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.
Clerics are intermediaries
between the mortal world
and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods
they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of
their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with
divine magic.
HEALERS
AND WARRIORS
Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of
the gods, lIowing from them into the world. Clerics are
conduits for that power, manifesting
it as miraculous
effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who
seeks it, but only to those chosen to fuIfi11a high calling.
Harnessing
divine magic doesn't rely on study or
training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and
ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on
devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.
Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and
inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder
foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of
plague or poison, and even call down liames from heaven
to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will
benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on
their combat training to let them wade into melee with
the power of the gods on their side.
DIVINE
AGENTS
Not every acolyte or officiant at a tem pIe or shrine is a
cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple
service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and
sacrifice, not by magic and strength
of arms. In some
cities, priesthood
amounts to a political office, viewed
as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and
involving no communion
with a god at alI. True clerics
are rare in most hierarchies.
When a cleric takes up an adventuring
life, it is usually
because his or her god demands it. Pursuing
the goals
of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the
walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in
ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect
