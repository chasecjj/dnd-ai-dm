PATHS
Rage burns in every barbarian's
heart. a furnace
that drives him or her toward greatness.
Different
barbarians
attribute their rage to different sources,
however. For some, it is an internai reservoir where
pain. grief. and anger are forged into a fury hard as
steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing. a gift of
a totem animal.
PATH OF THE BERSERKER
For some barbarians.
rage is a means to an end-that
end being violence. The Path of the Berserker
is a path
of untrammeled
fury, slick with blood. As you enter
the berserker's
rage. you thrill in the chaos of battle,
heedless of your own health or well-being.
FRENZY
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd levei. you
can go inlo a frenzy when you rage. lf you do so. for
the duration of your rage you can make a single melee
weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns
after this one. When your rage ends. you suffer one levei
of exhaustion
(as described
in appendix A).

frightened when you enter your rage. the effect is

frighten someone with your menacing presence.

that you can see
within 30 feet of YOU. lf the creature
can see or hear
YOU. it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC
equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your
next turno On subsequent
turns, you can use your action
to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened
