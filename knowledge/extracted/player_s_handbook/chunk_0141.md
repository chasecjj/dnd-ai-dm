an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For •.•
example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet
of movement to stand up. Vou can't stand up if you don't
have enough movement left or if your speed is O.
To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic
such as teleportation.
Every foot of movement while
crawling costs 1 extra fool. Crawling 1 foot in difficult
terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
Vou can move through a nonhostile creature's
space.
In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's
space only if the creature
is at least two sizes larger or
smaller than you. Remember
that another creature's
space is difficult terrain for you.
Whether a creature
is a friend or an enemy, you can't
willingly end your move in its space.
lfyou leave a hostil e creature's
reach during your
move, you provoke an opportunity
attack, as explained
later in the chapter.
MOVING
AROUND
OTHER
CREATURES
Flying creatures
enjoy many benetits of mobility, but
they must also deal with the danger of falling. lf a flying
creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to à, or
is otherwise
deprived of the ability to move, the creature
falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held
aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.
SPACE
A creature's
space is the area in feet that it effectively
controls in combat, not an expression
of its physical
dimensions.
A typical Medium creature
isn't 5 feet
wide, for example, but it does control a space that
wide. lf a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide
doorway, other creatures
can't get through unless the
hobgoblin lets them.
A creature's
space also reflects the area it needs to
tight effeetively. For that reason, there's a limit to lhe
number of ereatures
that can surround
another creature
in combal. Assuming
Medium combatants,
eight
creatures
can tit in a 5-foot radius around another one.
Because larger creatures
take up more space, fewer
of them can surround
a creature.

VARIANT:
PLAYING
ON
A CRIO
Ifyou play oul a combat using a square grid and minialures
ar olher lokens, follow lhese rules.
Squares.
Each square on lhe grid represents
5 feel.
Speed. Ralher lhan moving fool by fool, move square by
square on lhe grid. This means you use your speed in 5.foot
segments. This is particularly easy if you lranslate your speed
inlo squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed
of 30 feel lranslales
inlo a speed of 6 squares.
Ifyou use a grid often, consider wriling your speed in
squares on your characler sheel.
Enlering a Square. To enler a square, you musl have
ai leasl 1 square of movement
left, even if lhe square is
diagonally adjacenl lo lhe square you're in. (The rule for
diagonal movemenl
sacrifices realism for lhe sake of smoolh
play. The Dungeon
Mas!er's Cuide provides guidance on using
a more realislic approach.)
If a square cosls exlra movemenl,
as a square of diflicult
lerrain does, you musl have enough movemenl lefl lo pay for
enlering it. For example, you musl have ai leasl 2 squares of
movemenl
lefl lo enler a square of diflicull lerrain.
Corners. Diagonal movemenl can'l cross lhe comer of a
wall, large lree, ar olher lerrain fealure lhal fills its space.
Ranges. To delermine the range on a grid belween two
lhings-whelher
crealures ar objecls-start
counling squares
from a square adjacent lo one of lhem and slop counling in
lhe space of the olher one. Counl by lhe shortesl raule.

crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little
room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty
Medium creatures
can surround
a Gargantuan
one.
SQUEEZING
INTO A SMALLER
SPACE
A crealure can squeeze lhrough a space that is large
enough for a creature
one size smaller than il. Thus, a
Large creature
can squeeze through a passage that's
only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space,
a creature
must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it
moves there, and it has disadvantage
on attack rolls
and Dexlerily saving throws. Attack rolls against the
creature
have advantage while it's in the smaller space.
ACTIONS
IN COMBAT
When you take your action on your turn, you can take
one of the actions presented
here, an action you gained
from your class or a special feature, or an action that
you improvise. Many monsters have action options of
their own in their stat blocks.
When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere
in the roles, the DM tells you whether that action is
possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any,
to determine
success or failure.
ATTACK
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack
action, whether you are swinging a sword, Iiring an
arrow fram a bow, or brawling with your fists.
With this action, you make one melee or ranged
attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules
that govern attacks.
Certa in features, such as the Extra Attack feature
of the Iighter, allow you to make more than one attack
with this action.
PART
2 I COMBAT
CAST A SPELL
Spellcasters
such as wizards and clerics, as well as
many monsters,
have access to spells and can use
them to great effect in combal. Each spell has a casting
time, which specilies whether the caster must use an
action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the
spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily
an
action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action,
so a spellcaster
often uses his or her action in combat
to cast such a spell. See chapter 10 for the rules
on spellcasting.
DASH
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra
movement for the current turn. The increase equals
your speed, after applying any modiliers. With a speed
of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your
turn ifyou dash.
Any increase or decrease
to your speed changes this
additional movement by the same amounl. lf your speed
of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can
move up to 30 feel this turn if you dash.
DISENGAGE
lfyou take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't
provoke opportunity
attacks for the rest of the turn.
DODGE
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on
avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any
attack roll made againsl you has disadvantage
if you
can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving
throws with advantage. Vou lose this benelit if you are
incapacitated
(as explained in appendix A) or if your
speed drops to O.
HELP
Vou can lend your aid to another creature
in the
completion of a task. When you take the Help action,
the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability
check it makes to perform the task you are helping with,
provided that it makes the check before the start of
your next turno
Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature
in
attacking a creature
within 5 feet of you. Vou feint,
distract the target, or in some other way team up to
make your ally's attack more effective. lf your ally
attacks the target before your next turn, the Iirst attack
roll is made with advantage.
HIDE
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity
(Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules
in chapter 7 for hiding. lfyou succeed, you gain certain
benelits, as described
in the "Unseen Attackers and
Targets" section later in this chapter.
