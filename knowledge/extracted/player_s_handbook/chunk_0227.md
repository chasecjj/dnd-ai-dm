BEYOND THE MATERIAL
Beyond the Material Plane. the various planes of
existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're
not simply other worlds. but different qualities of
being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental
principIes abstracted
fram the ordinary world.
PLANAR TRAVEL
When adventurers
travei into other planes of existence,
they are undertaking
a legendary journey acrass the
thresholds
of existence to a mythic destination
where
they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the
stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead. seeking
out the celestial servants of a deity. or bargaining with
an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and
story for years to come.
TraveI to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be
accomplished
in two ways: by casting a spell or by using
a planar portal.
SpeJls. A number of spells allow direct or indirect
access to other planes of existence. Plane shift and
gate can transport
adventurers
directly to any other
plane of existence. with different degrees of precision.
Etherealness
allows adventurers
to enter the Ethereal
Plane and traveI fram there to any of the planes it
touches-the
Shadowfell. the Feywild. or the Elemental
Planes. And the astral projection spelllets
adventurers
praject themselves
into the Astral Plane and traveI to
the Outer Planes.
Porta/s.
A portal is a general term for a stationary
interplanar
connection
that links a specific location
on one plane to a specific location on another. Some
portaIs are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-
shrauded
passage, and simply stepping through it
effects the interplanar
traveI. Others are locations-
circles of standing stones, soaring towers. sailing ships,
or even whole towns-that
exist in multiple planes at
once or flicker from one plane to another in turno Some
are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a
very similar location on the Material Plane. such as the
heart of a voleano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the
depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).
TRANSITIVE
PLANES
The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the
Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless
realms
that serve primarily as ways to traveI from one plane
to another. Spells such as etherealness
and astral
projection allow characters
to enter these planes and
traverse them to reach the planes beyond.
The Ethereal
Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension
that is sometimes
described
as a great oceano Its shores,
called the Border Ethereal. overlap the Material Plane
and the lnner Planes, so that every location on those
planes has a corresponding
location on the Ethereal
Plane. Certain creatures
can see into the Border
Ethereal. and the see invisibility and true seeing spell
grunt that ability. Some magical effects also extend fram
the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal. particularly
effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall
of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are
a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.
The Astral Plane
is the realm of thought and dream.
where visitors traveI as disembodied
souls to reach
the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great,
silvery sea. the same above and below, with swirling
wisps of white and gray streaking
among motes of light
resembling
distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color
flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of
solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral
Plane is an endless. open domain.
INNER
PLANES
The Inner Planes surround
and enfold the Material
Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental
substance
from which ali the worlds were made. The
four Elemental
Planes-Ai
r, Earth. Fire, and Water-
form a ring araund the Material Plane. suspended
within the churning Elemental
Chaos.
At their innermost
edges. where they are closest
to the Material Plane (in a conceptual
if not a literal
geographical
sense). the four Elemental Planes
resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four
elements mingle together as they do in the Material
Plane. forming land. sea. and sky. Farther from the
Material Plane. though, the Elemental Planes are both
alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their
purest form-great
expanses
of solid earth. blazing fire.
crystal-clear
water, and unsullied air. These regions
are little-known. so when discussing
the Plane of Fire.
for example, a speaker usually means just the border
region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes,
the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an
unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding
substance,
the Elemental Chaos.
OUTER
PLANES
If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that
makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the
direction. thought and purpose for such construction.
Accordingly. many sages refer to the Outer Planes as
divine planes, spiritual planes. or godly planes, for the
Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.
When discussing
anything to do with deities, the
language used must be highly metaphorical.
Their
actual homes are not literally "places" at ali, but
exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of
thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one
can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as
a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions
lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.
Even in those perceptible
regions, appearances
can be deceptive. Initially. many of the Outer Planes
appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the
Material Plane. But the landscape
can change at the
whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer
Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on
these planes can remake them completely, effectively
erasing and rebuilding existence itself to bettcr fulfill
their own needs.
