# **Session 0 Report: The Troll in the Well**

## **Part 1: The Public Recap (Share with Players)**

**Subject:** Session 0 Report \- The Calm Before the Acid

**Real Date:** February 14, 2026

**In-Game Date:** 1st of Ches (The Night of the Brawl)

**Location:** The Yawning Portal, Castle Ward, Waterdeep

**Next Session:** \[Insert Date\]

### **The Story So Far**

* **You established your bond:** Frognar (Paladin) and Kallisar (Warlock) found themselves at a familiar table in the Yawning Portal, united by friendship, "cursed trinkets," and Frognar's unfortunate luck with the cards.  
* **You witnessed the spark:** A fistfight erupted between Yagra Strongfist (Zhentarim) and Krentz (Xanathar Guild), drawing the attention of the entire tavern.  
* **You held the line:** Choosing patience over impulse, you watched the chaos unfold, analyzing the room rather than throwing the first punch.  
* **The stakes escalated:** The brawl was cut short when a massive Troll, covered in blood-sucking Stirges, clawed its way out of the entry well.

### **Loot & Progression**

* **Experience/Milestone:** Level 1 (Character Creation Complete)  
* **New Items:** None... yet. (Though Frognar is lighter a few coins).  
* **Quest Updates:**  
  * **New:** *Survive the Troll Attack* (Protect the patrons and yourselves\!)

### **Memorable Quotes**

* *"Ya pig\! Like killin' me mates, does ya?"* — Krentz, moments before regretting his life choices.  
* *"To arms\! Keep it away from the tables\!"* — Durnan, The Barkeep.

## **Part 2: The DM's Private "After Action Review" (Do Not Share)**

### **1\. The Pulse (Table Health)**

* **Stars:** The "Odd Couple" dynamic is fantastic. Frognar’s gambling addiction vs. self-righteousness paired with Kallisar’s loyal enabler/investigator vibe provides infinite roleplay hooks.  
* **Wishes:** Kallisar explicitly asked to use **Investigation** in combat. I need to ensure there are environmental objects (chandeliers, spilled oil, tables to flip) that reward this.  
* **Bud:** Frognar's "wrong debtors." I can tie this debt to the **Cassalanters** (for a tragic twist) or the **Zhentarim** (to conflict with the current gang war).

### **2\. The Canon (World Updates)**

* **NPC Changes:** Yagra and Krentz are currently in the middle of the room. They will likely stop fighting each other to fight the Troll, acting as temporary meat shields for the players.  
* **Rulings to Review:** **Troll Regeneration.** *Note:* For Level 1 characters, a Troll is deadly. In *Dragon Heist*, Durnan (the bartender) is supposed to tank the Troll. I must ensure Durnan takes the heavy hits so the players can focus on the Stirges or helping Yagra.

### **3\. The Forecast (Next Session Prep)**

* **Current Player Intent:**  
  * **Kallisar:** Wants to scan the room for options/tactical advantages.  
  * **Frognar:** Likely to defend the weak or engage the threat directly.  
* **The Strong Start:** **ROLL INITIATIVE.**  
  * *Combat Balance:* With only 2 players, the Stirges are dangerous. I will have Durnan draw the Troll's aggro immediately.  
  * *After the Fight:* Volo will approach them immediately after the dust settles.  
  * *Handout:* Have the **Code Legal** ready to hand out if the City Watch shows up.
